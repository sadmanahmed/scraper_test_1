The successful all-in-one guide to modern Analytical Chemistry is now available in a new and updated edition. From the foundations of analytical science to state-of-the art techniques and instrumentation -- all you will ever need to know is explained here. The text covers both general analytical chemistry and instrumental analysis and may be used for most analytical chemistry courses offered today.
Carefully chosen worked examples show how analytical problems can effectively be solved and how calculations should be performed. Study questions and recommended reading for further study are provided for each learning unit.
The second edition has been carefully revised to keep up-to-date with advances in the technology of analytical methods in the laboratory and in the workplace, including newly written chapters on multidimensional chromatography, sensors and screening systems.
With its broad scope, the text doubles as a reliable reference for virtually all analytical problems encountered during the course of study and beyond.


\""Analytical Chemistry will serve as an excellent text as well as a valued reference following completion of the student\'s course of study.\""
Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

\""It is a book that should be on the shelves of all analytical chemistry and biochemistry professionals, including those who work in the areas of clinical chemistry, food chemistry and forensic chemistry.\""
Bulletin of the World Health Organisation

\""The book is a must-have reference for anyone trying to understand what techniques and technologies are available for the analytical chemist today.\""

About the Author

Jean-Michel Mermet is Research Director at the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). In 1985, he was appointed Director of the Laboratory of Analytical Sciences at the University of Lyon. His research interests have been focused on spectrochemistry of plasmas and lasers from fundamental, analytical and instrumental aspects. He has published more than 200 papers, reviews and book chapters.

Matthias Otto is Professor of Analytical Chemistry at the TU Bergakademie Freiberg in Germany. He was born in Dresden (Germany) and did all his studies at the University of Leipzig. In 1984 he moved to Freiberg (Germany) as a reader and was appointed full Professor there in 1987. Since that time he has taught almost all aspects of Analytical Chemistry mainly within the curricula of chemistry, applied sciences and geoecology and organizes courses in basic and advanced chemometrics.

Miguel Valcarcel is Professor of Analytical Chemistry at the University of C��ba (Spain) since 1976, member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences and currently chairman of the Analytical Division of the Federation of European Chemical Societies (DAC-FECS). He is author or co-author of 630 research papers and six monographs in the frame of automation, simplification and quality of (bio)chemical measurement processes.",Analytical Chemistry: A Modern Approach To Analytical Science,"H.
