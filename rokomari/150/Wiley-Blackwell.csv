This book analyzes sudden cardiac death from the multiple perspectives of world-renowned experts.
Fighting Sudden Cardiac Death: A Worldwide Challenge reviews the background of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in light of new advances in genetics, mechanisms of therapy, and prevention, thus providing the reader with a more unified view of SCD, a better understanding of the pathological mechanisms of SCD, and the tools needed to identify the appropriate treatment for patients at risk for a primary event. 
Its 50 chapters incorporate expert findings on a wide variety of relevant subjects, ranging from cell to examination, from idiopathic arrhythmias and SCD in athletes to arrhythmogenic heart failure, from long QT syndrome to ventricular dysplasia, from prehospital resuscitation to very sophisticated implantable devices. In-depth discussions on the background, therapy and prevention of SCD serve to increase and improve the tools available to battle this ""serial killer."" 
Cardiologists, electrophysiologists, and internists, both in clinical practice and in the laboratory, will find a great deal of valuable information in this book.",Fighting Sudden Cardiac Death: A Worldwide Challenge,Etienne Aliot, , ,Wiley-Blackwell,9780879934606,"1st Edition,2002",724,India,English

Written by a distinguished pioneer in the history and development of coronary angioscopic techniques, Coronary Angioscopy is the first and only book to systematically describe the present status of percutaneous coronary angioscopy and cardioscopy. Cardiologists and other interested physicians will value its clear explanations of the pathophysiology of coronary artery diseases, as well as the author's advice and instruction on the mastering of cutting-edge coronary angioscopic and cardioscopic techniques. 
The book's scope includes a review of the dramatic developments that have brought so much change in such a short time. From the introduction of the flexible endoscope in the late 1940s to the creation of the fiberscope by the author in the late 1990s, the tools and techniques described within are presented with well-earned authority. 
Composed of three parts (addressing the topics of coronary angioscopy, cardioscopy, and a discussion of possible future applications of both techniques), the book's large, well-designed, atlas-style format and extensive use of color illustrations (160 of 250 figures are in color) make it a particularly effective resource. In addition, it provides information on new findings, techniques and devices, such as the cardioscopic observation of coronary microvessels from the cardiac chambers themselves, many of which are not previously reported.",Coronary Angioscopy,Yasumi Uchida MD, , ,Wiley-Blackwell,9780879934781,"1st Edition,2001",274,India,English

Rapid developments in recent years in basic science and pharmacology has greatly increased understanding of the causes of anxiety disorders. This has led to a large number of new drug treatments from the pharmaceutical industry. This book makes sense of these advances and presents a coherent account of diagnosis and management from the clinical point of view. 
Chapters are in the form of surveys and digests of the recent literature and are interspersed with clinical guidelines, diagnostic and therapeutic points and are well illustrated.",Anxiety Disorders,"David  Nutt,James C.

Women with uterine disorders now have more choices than ever before - aggressive or minimally invasive surgery, hormonal manipulation, laser ablation, and so on. It is no longer acceptable simply to offer a choice of abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy to the patient with abnormal bleeding, whether due to fibroids, uterine cancer, or the menopause. Exciting new techniques in laparoscopic surgery and advances in reproductive endocrinology give the gynecologist more options when deciding on treatment plans. This clinical reference discusses the basic science and underlying pathophysiology, patient selection, the new techniques of minimally invasive surgery, endometrial ablation, and so on, and applies these to patient management, enabling the trainee and practitioner to make appropriate and informed choices",Hysterectomy,Michael P.

The interaction of the pulmonary circulation with the cellular elements of blood has received less attention. Interactions of Blood and the Pulmonary Circulation covers many topics of interest to the clinician. In particular, chapters on sickle cell anemia provide a wealth of information on mechanisms of vascular occlusion, suggesting new approaches to treatment for the cardiologist and the pulmonary and intensive care physician.

This book analyzes sudden cardiac death from the multiple perspectives of world-renowned experts.
Fighting Sudden Cardiac Death: A Worldwide Challenge reviews the background of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in light of new advances in genetics, mechanisms of therapy, and prevention, thus providing the reader with a more unified view of SCD, a better understanding of the pathological mechanisms of SCD, and the tools needed to identify the appropriate treatment for patients at risk for a primary event. 
Its 50 chapters incorporate expert findings on a wide variety of relevant subjects, ranging from cell to examination, from idiopathic arrhythmias and SCD in athletes to arrhythmogenic heart failure, from long QT syndrome to ventricular dysplasia, from prehospital resuscitation to very sophisticated implantable devices. In-depth discussions on the background, therapy and prevention of SCD serve to increase and improve the tools available to battle this ""serial killer.""

Written by a distinguished pioneer in the history and development of coronary angioscopic techniques, Coronary Angioscopy is the first and only book to systematically describe the present status of percutaneous coronary angioscopy and cardioscopy. Cardiologists and other interested physicians will value its clear explanations of the pathophysiology of coronary artery diseases, as well as the author's advice and instruction on the mastering of cutting-edge coronary angioscopic and cardioscopic techniques. 
The book's scope includes a review of the dramatic developments that have brought so much change in such a short time. From the introduction of the flexible endoscope in the late 1940s to the creation of the fiberscope by the author in the late 1990s, the tools and techniques described within are presented with well-earned authority. 
Composed of three parts (addressing the topics of coronary angioscopy, cardioscopy, and a discussion of possible future applications of both techniques), the book's large, well-designed, atlas-style format and extensive use of color illustrations (160 of 250 figures are in color) make it a particularly effective resource. In addition, it provides information on new findings, techniques and devices, such as the cardioscopic observation of coronary microvessels from the cardiac chambers themselves, many of which are not previously reported.",Coronary Angioscopy,Yasumi Uchida MD, , ,Wiley-Blackwell,9780879934781,"1st Edition,2001",274,India,English

Rapid developments in recent years in basic science and pharmacology has greatly increased understanding of the causes of anxiety disorders. This has led to a large number of new drug treatments from the pharmaceutical industry. This book makes sense of these advances and presents a coherent account of diagnosis and management from the clinical point of view. 
Chapters are in the form of surveys and digests of the recent literature and are interspersed with clinical guidelines, diagnostic and therapeutic points and are well illustrated.",Anxiety Disorders,"David  Nutt,James C.

Women with uterine disorders now have more choices than ever before - aggressive or minimally invasive surgery, hormonal manipulation, laser ablation, and so on. It is no longer acceptable simply to offer a choice of abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy to the patient with abnormal bleeding, whether due to fibroids, uterine cancer, or the menopause. Exciting new techniques in laparoscopic surgery and advances in reproductive endocrinology give the gynecologist more options when deciding on treatment plans. This clinical reference discusses the basic science and underlying pathophysiology, patient selection, the new techniques of minimally invasive surgery, endometrial ablation, and so on, and applies these to patient management, enabling the trainee and practitioner to make appropriate and informed choices",Hysterectomy,Michael P.
