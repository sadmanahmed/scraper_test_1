The Thorn Birds begins with Meggie Cleary, a four-year-old girl living in New Zealand in the early twentieth century, the only daughter of Paddy, an Irish farm labourer, and Fee, his harassed but aristocratic wife. Meggie's mother has a dark secret about the birth of her first son, Frank, who also happens to be her favorite child in comparison to the others. The Cleary family moves to Australia in the early 1900s to help their elderly aunt, Mary Carson in running a sheep station in the Outback. Employing on a large canvas that encompasses two world wars and the Great Depression, the author lets the main characters take turns in telling the story from 1915 to 1969. But the heart of the book is the forbidden love between Meggie and Ralph de Bricassart, the handsome parish priest. Interestingly, it is Meggie who makes herself suffer and yearn for Ralph for many years, while he goes on to pursue his great career in the church. He is obsessed with becoming the ""perfect priest”, but after his week with Meggie, he learns that he can never be perfect.  However, Ralph continues to strive to be a better priest and his love for Meggie helps him become a more understanding one. Theirs is a love with tremendous consequences for the future.

Family secrets, forbidden love, jealousy and the struggles of working in a hard new land intertwine in Colleen McCullough's bestselling romantic family saga making it an extremely fascinating read.

The Thorn Birds was listed at number 64 on the BBC's survey The Big Read in 2003 and in 1983, it was adapted as a TV mini-series that became the United States' second highest rated mini-series of all time.

Lady Elizabeth Cabot is no longer the reckless girl she once was. Now the darling of the ton, she is determined to put her past behind her. But who would have imagined that one immodest act could throw her entire world into chaos . . . and force her toward a loveless marriage? In desperation, she approaches her childhood friend, Peter Derby, with a daring plan.

Peter still remembers the wild and spirited girl who had stolen his heart. But could the rumors be true: is she the model for the scandalous painting hanging in London's most exclusive gentlemen's club? If Peter agrees to pose as her fiancé, Elizabeth has promised to reveal the whole truth.

But Peter has his own ideas about this sham ""engagement"" to the exquisite beauty who's always been just out of his reach—and he's willing to incite yet another scandal to make her heart truly his.",A Most Scandalous Engagement,CALLEN GAYLE, , ,Avon book,9780061783449,"1st Edition,2010",384,India,English
