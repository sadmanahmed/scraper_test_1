The contributors are among the most distinguished working in this field. They present the neuroanatomical and neurochemical basis of memory disorders in neurodegenerative disease, and review the contribution of neuroradiology and neuropathology to the understanding of memory and amnesia. Diagnosis, assessment and treatment issues are discussed, as are ethical and legal considerations and topics of emerging interest such as the early detection of dementia. Bringing together biological, cognitive and clinical information, this book will be an essential reference for clinicians and neuroscientists.

Three types of crop are considered; cereals, legumes and non-cereal energy crops, with individual chapters on the four most important crops in each group. This material is set in context by introductory chapters on tropical farming systems, tropical climates and tropical soils.

However, a true synergy between population genetics and conservation biology is lacking. Following the first International Workshop on Population Genetics for Animal Conservation in 2003 at the Centro di Ecologia Alpina, Trento, Italy (recently incorporated into the Edmund Mach Foundation), the scientific committee felt that, given the global urgency of animal conservation, it was imperative that discussions at the conference were made accessible to graduate students and wildlife managers. This book integrates 'the analytical methods approach' with the 'real problems approach' in conservation genetics. Each chapter is an exhaustive review of one area of expertise, and a special effort has been made to explain the statistical tools available for the analysis of molecular data as clearly as possible. The result is a comprehensive volume of the state of the art in conservation genetics, illustrating the power and utility of this synergy.",Population Genetics for Animal Conservation,Bertorelle Giorgio, , ,Cambridge University Press-New Delhi,9780521685375,"1st,2009",395,India,English

For the first time in book form, the study of distribution, abundance, and population size variation in animals is cast in an evolutionary framework. The book argues that evolved characters of organisms such as morphology, behavior, and life history influence strongly their ecological relationships, including the way that populations fluctuate through time and space. The central ideas in the book are supported by data gathered from over 20 years of research, primarily into plant and herbivore interactions, concentrating on insects. The huge diversity of insect herbivores provides the immense comparative power necessary for a strong evolutionary study of ecological principles. The book is intended as essential reading for all researchers and students of ecology, evolutionary biology, and behavior, and for entomologists working in agriculture, horticulture, and forestry.",Macroevolutionary Theory on Macroecological Patterns,Peter W.

It presents current information about memory disorders in Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases and in other neurological conditions such as progressive supranuclear palsy, Creutzfeld?Jacob disease and HIV-associated dementia. The contributors are among the most distinguished working in this field. They present the neuroanatomical and neurochemical basis of memory disorders in neurodegenerative disease, and review the contribution of neuroradiology and neuropathology to the understanding of memory and amnesia. Diagnosis, assessment and treatment issues are discussed, as are ethical and legal considerations and topics of emerging interest such as the early detection of dementia. Bringing together biological, cognitive and clinical information, this book will be an essential reference for clinicians and neuroscientists. It serves as an authoritative and up-to-date overview of the dementias and the prospects for treating them.","Memory In Neurodegenerative Disease - Biological,Cognitive,And Clinical Perspectives",Alexander I.

To make full use of often limited resources a good understanding of how environmental conditions affect the characteristics and performance of these crops is essential. This book considers the response of tropical food crops to environmental factors such as climate, soil and farming system. Three types of crop are considered; cereals, legumes and non-cereal energy crops, with individual chapters on the four most important crops in each group. This material is set in context by introductory chapters on tropical farming systems, tropical climates and tropical soils. This new, updated edition retains the successful formula of the first edition, and will serve the needs of advanced students of tropical agriculture, as well as professionals engaged in research and extension work in tropical crop production.",Tropical Food Crops in their Environment,Noorman, , ,Cambridge University Press-New Delhi,9780521586894, , ,India,English

Therefore, the book retains its focus on the fundamental principles used in gene manipulation. It is divided into three sections: Part I provides an introduction to the relevant basic molecular biology; Part II, the methods used to manipulate genes; and Part III, applications of the technology. There is a new chapter devoted to the emerging importance of bioinformatics as a distinct discipline. Other additional features include text boxes, which highlight important aspects of topics discussed, and chapter summaries, which include aims and learning outcomes.

However, a true synergy between population genetics and conservation biology is lacking. Following the first International Workshop on Population Genetics for Animal Conservation in 2003 at the Centro di Ecologia Alpina, Trento, Italy (recently incorporated into the Edmund Mach Foundation), the scientific committee felt that, given the global urgency of animal conservation, it was imperative that discussions at the conference were made accessible to graduate students and wildlife managers. This book integrates 'the analytical methods approach' with the 'real problems approach' in conservation genetics. Each chapter is an exhaustive review of one area of expertise, and a special effort has been made to explain the statistical tools available for the analysis of molecular data as clearly as possible. The result is a comprehensive volume of the state of the art in conservation genetics, illustrating the power and utility of this synergy.",Population Genetics for Animal Conservation,Bertorelle Giorgio, , ,Cambridge University Press-New Delhi,9780521685375,"1st,2009",395,India,English

For the first time in book form, the study of distribution, abundance, and population size variation in animals is cast in an evolutionary framework. The book argues that evolved characters of organisms such as morphology, behavior, and life history influence strongly their ecological relationships, including the way that populations fluctuate through time and space. The central ideas in the book are supported by data gathered from over 20 years of research, primarily into plant and herbivore interactions, concentrating on insects. The huge diversity of insect herbivores provides the immense comparative power necessary for a strong evolutionary study of ecological principles. The book is intended as essential reading for all researchers and students of ecology, evolutionary biology, and behavior, and for entomologists working in agriculture, horticulture, and forestry.",Macroevolutionary Theory on Macroecological Patterns,Peter W.
