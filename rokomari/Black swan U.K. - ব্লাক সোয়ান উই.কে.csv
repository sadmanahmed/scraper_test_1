A person named Rachel takes the train everyday, and a couple who live by the house next to the train racks, attracted her attention. She was so interested that she gave them nicknames. The most important reason for this, was that she once dreamed about a house near the one with the couple lived. Rachel was once married but when she found out that she could not have children, she got depressed and started drinking. After that, her husband cheated on her and married that woman, also living in the house that Rachel once dreamed about living. That’s why when she sees the couple, she sees her own past and her dream. But, when she saw the woman with a different man, she was surprised and got disappointed. 

Rachel got even more surprised when she saw the news one day. The woman from the couple she watched all the time, was missing and her husband was in shock. So, Rachel learns their real name. The suspect was the husband but Rachel does not believe that. She goes to the house to tell the husband what she saw a few days back. To get the man to believe her, Rachel says she is a friend of his wife and explains what she saw from the train. Also, she tells everything she knows to the police but because she is an alcoholic and disturbs her former husband, her words is uncared for. Moreover, Rachel was drunk, and was in the same neighborhood as where the couple lived, to disturb her husband again, the night the woman went missing, but she doesn’t remember anything.

Unlike most science books that require prior groundwork in the subject, A Short History of Nearly Everything has been written keeping in mind the common man who wonders how the things, people and the world around him all came into being. With his lucid and humorous writing, Bryson makes complex science matters seem unambiguous and appealing.

The book has 6 sections that explore a far-reaching array of topics surrounding geology, evolution and quantum mechanics. Using stories of the greatest inventors like Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Henry Cavendish and Edwin Hubble, the author crafts a compelling tale of science. The book first takes up the wonder that is the formation of this Universe and graphically describes concepts like the atomic and subatomic particles, and the size and shape of the Universe. It gradually moves on to inquire the development of homo sapiens and takes to explaining the biology of it.

The book leaves readers awe-stuck with all the fascinating facts about astonishing meteors and disastrous volcanic origins. The author also shares some comical anecdotes of great scientists and their eccentric acts. In the later part of the book, he discusses the modern scientific aspects about our planet's climate, the life and extinction of various other creatures and the increasing magnitudes of natural disasters. Ensuring utmost clarity and simplicity throughout the book, Bryson renders the most entertaining and absorbing story of the world of science.

A Short History Of Nearly Everything was published first in the year 2003 and became a bestselling science book. It won the Aventis Prize in 2004 and the EU Descartes Prize in 2005. It was also nominated for the Samuel Johnson Prize.
