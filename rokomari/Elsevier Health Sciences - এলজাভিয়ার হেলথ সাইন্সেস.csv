Marios Loukas, Brion Benninger, and R. Shane Tubbs, helps you take a clinical approach to the study of anatomy. This unique dissection guide uses full-color photographs rather than anatomical drawings to orient you more quickly in the lab, and points out the clinical significance of each structure and every dissection you make. You will also find valuable information on several emergency procedures used today to further reinforce the clinical correlations. With 1,300  photos, this resource is a great way to learn or review anatomy and its relevance to clinical practice.

Salient features

    Easily relate anatomy structures to clinical conditions and procedures.
    Perform dissections with confidence by comparing the 1,350 full-color photographs to the cadavers you study.
    Understand the pertinent anatomy for 18 common emergency procedures such as lumbar puncture and knee aspiration.
    Depend on the same level of accuracy and thoroughness that have made Gray’s Anatomy the defining reference on this complex subject, thanks to the expertise of Dr. Marios Loukas, a leading authority in the world of clinical anatomy.

The book presents a detailed and authoritative exposition of the basic principles and applications of biochemistry. It focuses primarily on clarity of the fundamental concepts and explains them according to the need of undergraduate medical students. The organization of content in this book is such that it provides the reader with a logical sequence of events that aids learning.

Salient Features*
    More emphasis in this edition is to systemize presentation and make reading soothing and pleasurable by deleting redundant details, adding new text and figures, improvement of earlier figures, supplementing text with easy to comprehend flowcharts, without changing basic framework of the book.*
    Each chapter ends with clinical cases and the related questions, which evokes yet another method of active learning rather than didactic methods of imparting knowledge.*
    Key points have been highlighted and boxed at the end of each topic for quick revision of the core concepts.*
    This book comes with a free companion website which contains self-assessment exercises, detailed case discussions related to the clinical cases given inside the book, glossary and various other features for enhanced learning.
