The Power of Self-Discipline written by Brian Tracy is the definitive self-help book if one wants to succeed in life. Whether the circumstances of one’s birth are rich or poor, their connections, and influences that others may hold over someone, they can still achieve their heart’s desire and attain all the success they want through sheer hard work. The author holds that most people either blame their circumstances for their own failings, or fall into the trap of taking the easy way out, or get discouraged if they do not receive instant gratification for their hard work. Nothing good in life comes easily, and success too demands true grit and hard work, along with perseverance. The author sets out the different ways to go about building up one’s self-discipline in order to achieve success in personal life, business or career and financial areas. Each chapter has exercises to help improve self-discipline so that one stops fooling herself with excuses. Fittingly, the exercises are designed to apply the ‘no-excuses’ approach to every aspect of one’s life.
