In this book, the author elaborates on the very trivial question: what makes people die and kill in the name of nations? The author portrays how nationalism born in America was adopted by the imperialists in Europe and by the anti-imperialist resistances in Asia and Africa. He further explores the interaction between capitalism and printing and the eventual birth of vernacular languages. This book is essential for students of polity and international relations.
