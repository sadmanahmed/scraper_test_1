allow them to dominate. You can permit obstacles to control your mind to the point where they are uppermost and thus become the dominating factors in your thought pattern. By learning how to cast them from the mind, by refusing to become mentally subservient to them, and by channeling spiritual power through your thoughts, you can rise above obstacles which ordinarily might defeat you. By methods I shall outline, obstacles are simply not permitted to destroy your happiness and well-being. You need be defeated only if you are willing to be. This book teaches you how to ‘will not to be. 
The purpose of this book is a very direct and simple one. It makes no pretence to literary excellence nor does it seek to demonstrate any unusual scholarship on my part. This is simply a practical, direct-action, personal improvement manual. It is written with the sole objective of helping the reader achieve a happy, satisfying, and worthwhile life. I thoroughly and enthusiastically believe in certain demonstrated and effective principles which, when practised, produce a victorious life. My aim is to set them forth in this volume in a logical, simple, and understandable manner so that the reader, feeling a sense of need, may learn a practical method by which he can build for himself, with God's help, the kind of life he deeply desires. 
If you read this book thoughtfully, carefully absorbing its teachings, and if you will sincerely and persistently practise the principles and formulas set forth herein, you can experience an amazing improvement within yourself. By using the techniques outlined herewith you can modify or change the circumstances in which you now live, assuming control over them rather than continuing to be directed by them. Your relations

This is a book on thinking big. The premise is that most people go through life with small amibitions, small goals, thinking small, and they only rise to the size of their dreams. But by thinking big, what’s now called “10x” thinking, you can do great, huge things, so long as you believe in yourself and follow through on the pursuit of those huge goals.

“All of us, more than we recognize, are products of the thinking around us. And much of this thinking is little, not big. All around you is an environment that is trying to tug you, trying to pull you down Second Class Street. You are told almost daily that there are “too many chiefs and not enough Indians.” In other words, that opportunities to lead no longer exist, that there is a surplus of chiefs, so be content to be a little guy.”

“Life is too short to be little.”

“Those who believe they can move mountains, do. Those who believe they can’t, cannot. Belief triggers the power to do.”

“It is well to respect the leader. Learn from him. Observe him. Study him. But don’t worship him. Believe you can surpass. Believe you can go beyond. Those who harbor the second-best attitude are invariably second-best doers.”

No one will believe in you until you believe in yourself.

“Remind yourself regularly that you are better than you think you are. Successful people are not supermen.”

“Believe Big. The size of your success is determined by the size of your belief. Think little goals and expect little achievements. Think big goals and win big success. Remember this, too! Big ideas and big plans are often easier— certainly no more difficult— than small ideas and small plans.”(nateliason.com)",The Magic Of Thinking Big (6 Million Sold),David Joseph Schwartz, , ,Vermilion London,9781785040474,"1st Editon,2016",362,United Kingdom,English
