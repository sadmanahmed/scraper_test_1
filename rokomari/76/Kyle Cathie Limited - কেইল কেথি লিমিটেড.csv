After reaching America, Columbus introduced Europe to new foodstuffs such as chilli and chocolate, and the words that described them. Pope Boniface VIII proclaimed the first ""jubilee"" in 1300, and Francis Bacon published the first ""essay"" in 1597. The Normans gave us the ""feudal system"" and ""curfews,"" while the flourishing of Dutch art in the 17th century introduced ""easels,"" ""etchings,"" and ""landscapes."" Thus, throughout history, events great and small have left their mark on the way we speak. Starting from 1066 and working through to the present-day boom in techno-speak, this book links hundreds of words with the historical upheavals and minor social changes which gave them life.",Dictionary of English Down the Ages,"Linda Flavell,Roger Flavell", , ,Kyle Cathie Limited,9781856266031, , ,Abroad,English

This book is ideal for students studying engineering for the first time as part of BTEC National and other pre-degree vocational courses (especially where progression to higher levels of study is likely), as well as Higher Nationals, Foundation Degrees and first year undergraduate modules.

Now in its third edition, this best-selling textbook has been updated with developments in key areas such as semiconductors, transistors, and fuel cells, along with brand new material on ABCD parameters and Fourier's Analysis. Greater emphasis is placed on real-world situations in order to ensure the reader can relate the theory to actual engineering practice. In addition, the text has been restructured throughout so that 175 Exercises now appear at regular intervals, which the student can work through to test their learning of essential concepts and check their progress.
