""About the end of the book""
This book aims at all times to be functional-short on theory, long on practice. There are a number of things you can expect from it. Not every person who reads it will accomplish everthing the book demands, but in general these are the important effects you may, and should, look for early in your work:
A feeling of greater courage in approching new material. The ability to ""get into"" books or other reading matter more quickly, more happily. Less distraction from outside influence while you are reading. Greater awareness of an author's deeper meaning. Sharper understanding of the all-over pattern of a piece of work, of whatever length, A sense of deeper involment in the content of what you are reading. A fuller comprehension of both the author's purpose in writing and your own purpose in reading what he has written. The capacity to stay with a work for longer periods of time, to respond to it on a deeper level than heretofore, to understand it more clearly and more quickly, to retain it longer, to recall it more accurately. An all-encompassing sense of greater accomplishment in most reading situations.",How To Get More Out Of Your Reading,Norman Lewis, , ,Kogan Page Limited,8183071961,"1st Edition,2007",426,India,English
