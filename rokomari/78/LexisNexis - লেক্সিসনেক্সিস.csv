Ratanlal and Dhirajlal’s the Law of Evidence,শাকিল আহমেদ খান ,"","TK. 1,521",https://rokomari.com//book/173055/ratanlal-and-dhirajlal-s-the-law-of-evidence,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/1baf873ac_173055.jpg,"The law of evidence occupies a pivotal role in the effective functioning of the judicial system as the existence of substantive rights can only be established by relevant and admissible evidence. It lays down the quintessential aspects of judicial investigation for effective administration of justice. With rapid advances in diverse fields of life, human relations have undergone an unforeseen transformation, presenting new conflicts and controversies. The law of evidence has to therefore regularly groom itself for facing the emerging developments which pose unprecedented problems in the collection of evidence and proof of facts. Over the years, the Courts through judicial precedents and diverse case law have enriched the lexicon of the law of evidence.

First published in 1897, this legal classic has withstood the test of time, and served the legal profession and everyone associated with it, for over a century. Its appeal has not withered but has only grown with the passage of time.
The 27th edition of this leading commentary on the law of torts has been painstakingly revised to include the latest judicial as well as legislative developments in the ever evolving subject of torts. It covers the latest case law as well as the legislative amendments that have come about since the publication of last edition. All landmark decisions, such as the Limestone quarrying in Doon Valley case (1985), Oleum Gas Leak case (1986), Delhi Pollution case (1988), Bicchri case (1989), Jacob Mathew case on medical negligence (2005), Bhopal Gas Leak case, Uphaar Cinema and the related Sushil Ansal case (2014) have been discussed. The book also examines the legislative provisions dealing with liability under the Environment Protection Act, the Consumer Protection Act as well as the Motor Vehicles Act.

In this Summary, the original has been scrupulously followed and later developments are pointed out in footnotes. Stability and progress are the two main pillars of law. Expectations aroused by past experience over a period of time cannot be easily upset, otherwise social stability is undermined. On the other hand, the felt necessities of time can be disregarded by the legislator at the peril of the destruction of social structure itself. The interplay between these two ideologies – stability on one hand and social necessity on the other – is particularly visible in law making in India today.",Summary of Salmond's Jurisprudence,A K Sarkar, , ,LexisNexis,9788180385803,3rd Edition, ,Abroad,English

It lays down the quintessential aspects of judicial investigation for effective administration of justice. With rapid advances in diverse fields of life, human relations have undergone an unforeseen transformation, presenting new conflicts and controversies. The law of evidence has to therefore regularly groom itself for facing the emerging developments which pose unprecedented problems in the collection of evidence and proof of facts. Over the years, the Courts through judicial precedents and diverse case law have enriched the lexicon of the law of evidence.

It covers the latest case law as well as the legislative amendments that have come about since the publication of last edition.

In this Summary, the original has been scrupulously followed and later developments are pointed out in footnotes. Stability and progress are the two main pillars of law. Expectations aroused by past experience over a period of time cannot be easily upset, otherwise social stability is undermined. On the other hand, the felt necessities of time can be disregarded by the legislator at the peril of the destruction of social structure itself. The interplay between these two ideologies – stability on one hand and social necessity on the other – is particularly visible in law making in India today.",Summary of Salmond's Jurisprudence,A K Sarkar, , ,LexisNexis,9788180385803,3rd Edition, ,Abroad,English

It lays down the quintessential aspects of judicial investigation for effective administration of justice. With rapid advances in diverse fields of life, human relations have undergone an unforeseen transformation, presenting new conflicts and controversies. The law of evidence has to therefore regularly groom itself for facing the emerging developments which pose unprecedented problems in the collection of evidence and proof of facts. Over the years, the Courts through judicial precedents and diverse case law have enriched the lexicon of the law of evidence.

First published in 1897, this legal classic has withstood the test of time, and served the legal profession and everyone associated with it, for over a century. Its appeal has not withered but has only grown with the passage of time.
The 27th edition of this leading commentary on the law of torts has been painstakingly revised to include the latest judicial as well as legislative developments in the ever evolving subject of torts. It covers the latest case law as well as the legislative amendments that have come about since the publication of last edition. All landmark decisions, such as the Limestone quarrying in Doon Valley case (1985), Oleum Gas Leak case (1986), Delhi Pollution case (1988), Bicchri case (1989), Jacob Mathew case on medical negligence (2005), Bhopal Gas Leak case, Uphaar Cinema and the related Sushil Ansal case (2014) have been discussed. The book also examines the legislative provisions dealing with liability under the Environment Protection Act, the Consumer Protection Act as well as the Motor Vehicles Act.

In this Summary, the original has been scrupulously followed and later developments are pointed out in footnotes. Stability and progress are the two main pillars of law. Expectations aroused by past experience over a period of time cannot be easily upset, otherwise social stability is undermined. On the other hand, the felt necessities of time can be disregarded by the legislator at the peril of the destruction of social structure itself. The interplay between these two ideologies – stability on one hand and social necessity on the other – is particularly visible in law making in India today.",Summary of Salmond's Jurisprudence,A K Sarkar, , ,LexisNexis,9788180385803,3rd Edition, ,Abroad,English

It lays down the quintessential aspects of judicial investigation for effective administration of justice. With rapid advances in diverse fields of life, human relations have undergone an unforeseen transformation, presenting new conflicts and controversies. The law of evidence has to therefore regularly groom itself for facing the emerging developments which pose unprecedented problems in the collection of evidence and proof of facts. Over the years, the Courts through judicial precedents and diverse case law have enriched the lexicon of the law of evidence.

In this Summary, the original has been scrupulously followed and later developments are pointed out in footnotes. Stability and progress are the two main pillars of law. Expectations aroused by past experience over a period of time cannot be easily upset, otherwise social stability is undermined. On the other hand, the felt necessities of time can be disregarded by the legislator at the peril of the destruction of social structure itself. The interplay between these two ideologies – stability on one hand and social necessity on the other – is particularly visible in law making in India today.",Summary of Salmond's Jurisprudence,A K Sarkar, , ,LexisNexis,9788180385803,3rd Edition, ,Abroad,English

It lays down the quintessential aspects of judicial investigation for effective administration of justice. With rapid advances in diverse fields of life, human relations have undergone an unforeseen transformation, presenting new conflicts and controversies. The law of evidence has to therefore regularly groom itself for facing the emerging developments which pose unprecedented problems in the collection of evidence and proof of facts. Over the years, the Courts through judicial precedents and diverse case law have enriched the lexicon of the law of evidence.

First published in 1897, this legal classic has withstood the test of time, and served the legal profession and everyone associated with it, for over a century. Its appeal has not withered but has only grown with the passage of time.
The 27th edition of this leading commentary on the law of torts has been painstakingly revised to include the latest judicial as well as legislative developments in the ever evolving subject of torts. It covers the latest case law as well as the legislative amendments that have come about since the publication of last edition. All landmark decisions, such as the Limestone quarrying in Doon Valley case (1985), Oleum Gas Leak case (1986), Delhi Pollution case (1988), Bicchri case (1989), Jacob Mathew case on medical negligence (2005), Bhopal Gas Leak case, Uphaar Cinema and the related Sushil Ansal case (2014) have been discussed. The book also examines the legislative provisions dealing with liability under the Environment Protection Act, the Consumer Protection Act as well as the Motor Vehicles Act.

In this Summary, the original has been scrupulously followed and later developments are pointed out in footnotes. Stability and progress are the two main pillars of law. Expectations aroused by past experience over a period of time cannot be easily upset, otherwise social stability is undermined. On the other hand, the felt necessities of time can be disregarded by the legislator at the peril of the destruction of social structure itself. The interplay between these two ideologies – stability on one hand and social necessity on the other – is particularly visible in law making in India today.",Summary of Salmond's Jurisprudence,A K Sarkar, , ,LexisNexis,9788180385803,3rd Edition, ,Abroad,English

It lays down the quintessential aspects of judicial investigation for effective administration of justice. With rapid advances in diverse fields of life, human relations have undergone an unforeseen transformation, presenting new conflicts and controversies. The law of evidence has to therefore regularly groom itself for facing the emerging developments which pose unprecedented problems in the collection of evidence and proof of facts. Over the years, the Courts through judicial precedents and diverse case law have enriched the lexicon of the law of evidence.

In this Summary, the original has been scrupulously followed and later developments are pointed out in footnotes. Stability and progress are the two main pillars of law. Expectations aroused by past experience over a period of time cannot be easily upset, otherwise social stability is undermined. On the other hand, the felt necessities of time can be disregarded by the legislator at the peril of the destruction of social structure itself. The interplay between these two ideologies – stability on one hand and social necessity on the other – is particularly visible in law making in India today.",Summary of Salmond's Jurisprudence,A K Sarkar, , ,LexisNexis,9788180385803,3rd Edition, ,Abroad,English

It lays down the quintessential aspects of judicial investigation for effective administration of justice. With rapid advances in diverse fields of life, human relations have undergone an unforeseen transformation, presenting new conflicts and controversies. The law of evidence has to therefore regularly groom itself for facing the emerging developments which pose unprecedented problems in the collection of evidence and proof of facts. Over the years, the Courts through judicial precedents and diverse case law have enriched the lexicon of the law of evidence.

First published in 1897, this legal classic has withstood the test of time, and served the legal profession and everyone associated with it, for over a century. Its appeal has not withered but has only grown with the passage of time.
The 27th edition of this leading commentary on the law of torts has been painstakingly revised to include the latest judicial as well as legislative developments in the ever evolving subject of torts. It covers the latest case law as well as the legislative amendments that have come about since the publication of last edition. All landmark decisions, such as the Limestone quarrying in Doon Valley case (1985), Oleum Gas Leak case (1986), Delhi Pollution case (1988), Bicchri case (1989), Jacob Mathew case on medical negligence (2005), Bhopal Gas Leak case, Uphaar Cinema and the related Sushil Ansal case (2014) have been discussed. The book also examines the legislative provisions dealing with liability under the Environment Protection Act, the Consumer Protection Act as well as the Motor Vehicles Act.

In this Summary, the original has been scrupulously followed and later developments are pointed out in footnotes. Stability and progress are the two main pillars of law. Expectations aroused by past experience over a period of time cannot be easily upset, otherwise social stability is undermined. On the other hand, the felt necessities of time can be disregarded by the legislator at the peril of the destruction of social structure itself.

It lays down the quintessential aspects of judicial investigation for effective administration of justice. With rapid advances in diverse fields of life, human relations have undergone an unforeseen transformation, presenting new conflicts and controversies. The law of evidence has to therefore regularly groom itself for facing the emerging developments which pose unprecedented problems in the collection of evidence and proof of facts. Over the years, the Courts through judicial precedents and diverse case law have enriched the lexicon of the law of evidence.

In this Summary, the original has been scrupulously followed and later developments are pointed out in footnotes. Stability and progress are the two main pillars of law. Expectations aroused by past experience over a period of time cannot be easily upset, otherwise social stability is undermined. On the other hand, the felt necessities of time can be disregarded by the legislator at the peril of the destruction of social structure itself. The interplay between these two ideologies – stability on one hand and social necessity on the other – is particularly visible in law making in India today.",Summary of Salmond's Jurisprudence,A K Sarkar, , ,LexisNexis,9788180385803,3rd Edition, ,Abroad,English

The appendices to the book contain specimen clauses in a contract; public procurement, national and international competitive bidding; Central Vigilance Commission guidelines on tender procedure; flaws in contracts; salient features of the World Bank procedures for procurement and for appointment of consultants. The present edition contains the CVC Guidelines up to 2012 and the World Bank procedures as revised in January 2011. The book provides an insight into the legal issues involved, without making it too legalistic, and serves as a handbook of reference to those who are engaged in negotiating contracts and to help them avoid the pitfalls involved. The book has given significant coverage to important decisions of the Supreme Court, explaining the lessons to be drawn therefrom. We are confident that this book will prove to be an invaluable aid to all those interested in this subject.

It lays down the quintessential aspects of judicial investigation for effective administration of justice. With rapid advances in diverse fields of life, human relations have undergone an unforeseen transformation, presenting new conflicts and controversies. The law of evidence has to therefore regularly groom itself for facing the emerging developments which pose unprecedented problems in the collection of evidence and proof of facts. Over the years, the Courts through judicial precedents and diverse case law have enriched the lexicon of the law of evidence.

Its appeal has not withered but has only grown with the passage of time.
The 27th edition of this leading commentary on the law of torts has been painstakingly revised to include the latest judicial as well as legislative developments in the ever evolving subject of torts. It covers the latest case law as well as the legislative amendments that have come about since the publication of last edition. All landmark decisions, such as the Limestone quarrying in Doon Valley case (1985), Oleum Gas Leak case (1986), Delhi Pollution case (1988), Bicchri case (1989), Jacob Mathew case on medical negligence (2005), Bhopal Gas Leak case, Uphaar Cinema and the related Sushil Ansal case (2014) have been discussed. The book also examines the legislative provisions dealing with liability under the Environment Protection Act, the Consumer Protection Act as well as the Motor Vehicles Act.

In this Summary, the original has been scrupulously followed and later developments are pointed out in footnotes. Stability and progress are the two main pillars of law. Expectations aroused by past experience over a period of time cannot be easily upset, otherwise social stability is undermined. On the other hand, the felt necessities of time can be disregarded by the legislator at the peril of the destruction of social structure itself. The interplay between these two ideologies – stability on one hand and social necessity on the other – is particularly visible in law making in India today.",Summary of Salmond's Jurisprudence,A K Sarkar, , ,LexisNexis,9788180385803,3rd Edition, ,Abroad,English

It lays down the quintessential aspects of judicial investigation for effective administration of justice. With rapid advances in diverse fields of life, human relations have undergone an unforeseen transformation, presenting new conflicts and controversies. The law of evidence has to therefore regularly groom itself for facing the emerging developments which pose unprecedented problems in the collection of evidence and proof of facts. Over the years, the Courts through judicial precedents and diverse case law have enriched the lexicon of the law of evidence.

First published in 1897, this legal classic has withstood the test of time, and served the legal profession and everyone associated with it, for over a century. Its appeal has not withered but has only grown with the passage of time.
The 27th edition of this leading commentary on the law of torts has been painstakingly revised to include the latest judicial as well as legislative developments in the ever evolving subject of torts. It covers the latest case law as well as the legislative amendments that have come about since the publication of last edition. All landmark decisions, such as the Limestone quarrying in Doon Valley case (1985), Oleum Gas Leak case (1986), Delhi Pollution case (1988), Bicchri case (1989), Jacob Mathew case on medical negligence (2005), Bhopal Gas Leak case, Uphaar Cinema and the related Sushil Ansal case (2014) have been discussed. The book also examines the legislative provisions dealing with liability under the Environment Protection Act, the Consumer Protection Act as well as the Motor Vehicles Act.

In this Summary, the original has been scrupulously followed and later developments are pointed out in footnotes. Stability and progress are the two main pillars of law. Expectations aroused by past experience over a period of time cannot be easily upset, otherwise social stability is undermined. On the other hand, the felt necessities of time can be disregarded by the legislator at the peril of the destruction of social structure itself. The interplay between these two ideologies – stability on one hand and social necessity on the other – is particularly visible in law making in India today.",Summary of Salmond's Jurisprudence,A K Sarkar, , ,LexisNexis,9788180385803,3rd Edition, ,Abroad,English

It lays down the quintessential aspects of judicial investigation for effective administration of justice. With rapid advances in diverse fields of life, human relations have undergone an unforeseen transformation, presenting new conflicts and controversies. The law of evidence has to therefore regularly groom itself for facing the emerging developments which pose unprecedented problems in the collection of evidence and proof of facts. Over the years, the Courts through judicial precedents and diverse case law have enriched the lexicon of the law of evidence.

In this Summary, the original has been scrupulously followed and later developments are pointed out in footnotes. Stability and progress are the two main pillars of law. Expectations aroused by past experience over a period of time cannot be easily upset, otherwise social stability is undermined. On the other hand, the felt necessities of time can be disregarded by the legislator at the peril of the destruction of social structure itself. The interplay between these two ideologies – stability on one hand and social necessity on the other – is particularly visible in law making in India today.",Summary of Salmond's Jurisprudence,A K Sarkar, , ,LexisNexis,9788180385803,3rd Edition, ,Abroad,English

It lays down the quintessential aspects of judicial investigation for effective administration of justice. With rapid advances in diverse fields of life, human relations have undergone an unforeseen transformation, presenting new conflicts and controversies. The law of evidence has to therefore regularly groom itself for facing the emerging developments which pose unprecedented problems in the collection of evidence and proof of facts. Over the years, the Courts through judicial precedents and diverse case law have enriched the lexicon of the law of evidence.

First published in 1897, this legal classic has withstood the test of time, and served the legal profession and everyone associated with it, for over a century. Its appeal has not withered but has only grown with the passage of time.
The 27th edition of this leading commentary on the law of torts has been painstakingly revised to include the latest judicial as well as legislative developments in the ever evolving subject of torts. It covers the latest case law as well as the legislative amendments that have come about since the publication of last edition. All landmark decisions, such as the Limestone quarrying in Doon Valley case (1985), Oleum Gas Leak case (1986), Delhi Pollution case (1988), Bicchri case (1989), Jacob Mathew case on medical negligence (2005), Bhopal Gas Leak case, Uphaar Cinema and the related Sushil Ansal case (2014) have been discussed. The book also examines the legislative provisions dealing with liability under the Environment Protection Act, the Consumer Protection Act as well as the Motor Vehicles Act.

In this Summary, the original has been scrupulously followed and later developments are pointed out in footnotes. Stability and progress are the two main pillars of law. Expectations aroused by past experience over a period of time cannot be easily upset, otherwise social stability is undermined. On the other hand, the felt necessities of time can be disregarded by the legislator at the peril of the destruction of social structure itself. The interplay between these two ideologies – stability on one hand and social necessity on the other – is particularly visible in law making in India today.",Summary of Salmond's Jurisprudence,A K Sarkar, , ,LexisNexis,9788180385803,3rd Edition, ,Abroad,English
