Confronting themes of love, injustice, the beauty of nature and the acute pain of war and oppression, the reader is seamlessly conducted through a range of emotions, from the sensual and intimate through melancholy and solitude to the combative and defiant. Zillur Rahman Shuvro gives himself licence to ‘flow like a reckless fountain' and sheds light on the heart of the human condition. With a powerful voice in seeking to expose evil's true face, he lays bare urban decay and ugliness with stark precision. Yet a soothing moonlit oasis and moments of warm sensuality provide a compelling and alluring backdrop to mankind's perplexing daily struggle.",Bible of Love and Obscurity,Zillur Rahman Shuvro, , ,Olympia Publisher London,9781788304023,"1st Published,2020",132,India,English
