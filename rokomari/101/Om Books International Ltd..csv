Foreword
I looked around upon the world, and saw that it was shadowed by sorrow and scorched by the fierce fires of suffering. And I looked for the cause. I looked around, but I could not find it; I looked in books, but I could not find it; I looked within, and found there both the cause and the self-made nature of that cause. I looked again, and deeper, and found the remedy. I found one Law, the Law of love; one life, the life of adjustment to that Law; one Truth, the Truth of a conquered mind and a quiet and obedient heart.

And I dreamed of writing books which would help men and women, whether rich or poor, learned or unlearned, worldly or unworldly to find within themselves the source of all success, all happiness, all accomplishment, all truth. And the dream remained with me, and at last became",As a Man Thinketh,James Allen, , ,Om Books International Ltd.,9789385609770,"1st Published,2016",72,India,English

allow them to dominate. You can permit obstacles to control your mind to the point where they are uppermost and thus become the dominating factors in your thought pattern. By learning how to cast them from the mind, by refusing to become mentally subservient to them, and by channeling spiritual power through your thoughts, you can rise above obstacles which ordinarily might defeat you. By methods I shall outline, obstacles are simply not permitted to destroy your happiness and well-being. You need be defeated only if you are willing to be. This book teaches you how to ‘will not to be. 
The purpose of this book is a very direct and simple one. It makes no pretence to literary excellence nor does it seek to demonstrate any unusual scholarship on my part. This is simply a practical, direct-action, personal improvement manual. It is written with the sole objective of helping the reader achieve a happy, satisfying, and worthwhile life. I thoroughly and enthusiastically believe in certain demonstrated and effective principles which, when practised, produce a victorious life. My aim is to set them forth in this volume in a logical, simple, and understandable manner so that the reader, feeling a sense of need, may learn a practical method by which he can build for himself, with God's help, the kind of life he deeply desires. 
If you read this book thoughtfully, carefully absorbing its teachings, and if you will sincerely and persistently practise the principles and formulas set forth herein, you can experience an amazing improvement within yourself. By using the techniques outlined herewith you can modify or change the circumstances in which you now live, assuming control over them rather than continuing to be directed by them. Your relations

When the nuclear scientist Vikram Singh is murdered, his nephew Vijay receives four cryptic emails, which lay out a trail of adventure before him. This trail leads to a secret buried in the Mahabharata over 2300 years ago by the great king Ashoka.

Ashoka had uncovered this lost text of the Mahabharata and deemed it too dangerous for humanity. He had therefore hidden it and formed The Nine, a group of great minds entrusted with the protection of the terrible secret. Each of the Nine had been given one piece of the puzzle and thus, none of them could complete it by themselves.

However, one of the Nine had given in to evil, and had murdered each of the Nine one by one. Vikram Singh was a part of this Nine. On his death, he passes on his secret to his nephew and implores him to find and hide the secret before terrorists do so.

In Afghanistan, the Buddha statues were bombed by the Taliban. In the wreckage, they discover something which tells them that the legends of a great weapon in the Mahabharata were indeed true.

Thus, unfolds a race to the secret which could destroy the entire world if it falls into the wrong hands. Who will uncover the secret first, Vijay and his trusted friends or the terrorists? This spine chilling adventure combines history, mythology, suspense and science in the present day world.
