The 48 Laws of Power proved that Robert Greene is the master of distilling ancient wisdom and philosophy into essential precepts for seekers of control. Now he turns his piercing gaze to human nature and the hitherto unwritten laws which govern it. Despite the passage of centuries, human needs and frailties have remained much the same. Greene draws valuable lessons from the past to reveal the truth about what motivates people and to teach us how to use that knowledge for success and power.
Drawing from thousands of years of history, from the lives of figures such as Pericles, Elizabeth I and Coco Chanel to the techniques and tactics of Hesiod, Nietzsche, Martin Luther King Jr and many others, Greene teaches us how to discipline our emotions and see through other people's masks. The Laws of Human Nature is full of invaluable lessons on building up character, confronting our dark sides, resisting the pull of the group and finding a sense of purpose. Whether at work, in relationships or in understanding and shaping the world around you, Greene offers brilliant strategies for success, conquest and self-defence in the ultimate guide to becoming the most powerful version of yourself.",The Laws Of Human Nature,Robert Greene, , ,Profile Books,9781781259191,"1st Published,2018",610,India,English

What Got You Here Won't Get You There: How Successful People Become Even More Successful is a book that has been written by one of the leading figures in the management arena, Marshall Goldsmith, and is directed towards enabling people achieve their full potential, by overcoming certain detrimental work habits.

In the first section of this book, Goldsmith tells the readers that when a person achieves consistent success at their workplace, there are certain wrong beliefs that often set in, causing them to feel more potent than they actually are. The author notes that this mindset mostly results in failure, rather than success. In the second section, he deals with a list of 20 habits that prevent people from success in their life, explaining them in detail. Few of those habits are Winning Too Much, Speaking When Angry, Withholding Information, Playing Favourites, Not Listening, and Passing The Buck. He also adds the 21st habit, which is Goal Obsession, citing that individuals often spend a great deal of time planning for long-term goals. He further adds that an obsession with goals, often results in many of the detrimental habits he outlines.

The third section provides the readers with a 7-step plan to overcome these habits, and they include Telling The World, Or Advertising, Feedback, Practicing “Feedforward”, Thanking, Listening, Apologizing, and Following Up. The fourth section of this book is directed specifically towards individuals involved in the field of management. Goldsmith begins to throw light on certain issues prevalent in an organization, and ways to deal with them when they surface, in subordinates, as well as in those in-charge.
