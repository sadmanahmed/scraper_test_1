All educators including students, teachers, researchers, practitioners or consumers of research from any disciplines even doctors, engineers or all other professionals can be benefited from this book. I have prepared this book from my graduate adn post graduate lecture notes, ten years of teaching experiences in this fields, and different training programs (e.g. Research Methodology for Researcher, BARD, Comilla; Research Methodology, Center for Advanced Research, University of Dhaka; Research Concepts and Issues, ISS, Hague, Netherlands and North South University etc.). It will provide the readers with a basic framework for understanding and evaluating research studies. It will also provide knowledge of the various types of research designs used in research and the procedures for conducting research studies. This book will provide an opportunity for readers to establish or advance their understanding of research through critical exploration of research language, ethics, and approaches. The book introduces the language of research, ethical principles and challenges, and the elements of the research process within quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods approaches. Readers will use these theoretical underpinnings to begin to critically review literature relevant to their field or interests and determine how research findings are useful in informing their understanding of their environment. 

This book has been written for beginners who are currently involved in research and are interested to apply qualitative and quantitative methods in their area of work. Throughout the book, basic philosophy of applying qualitative and quantitative perspectives along with pertinent issues of qualitative and quantitative research methods and applicability of various instruments of gathering qualitative and quantitative data in systematic, scientific and ethical ways are discussed. Upon completion of this book, readers are expected to obtain a basic understanding of qualitative and quantitative research methods by realizing its importance and relevance to the field of research. It is anticipated that readers would learn to prepare a research concept note by using research methods. 

This book introduces students to a number of research methods useful for academic and professional investigations of information practices, texts and technologies. By examining the applications, strengths and major criticisms of methodologies drawn from both the qualitative and quantitative traditions, this book permits an understanding of the various decisions and steps involved in crafting (and executing) a research methodology, as well as a critically informed assessment of published research. The book describes an overview of the different approaches, considerations and challenges involved in research. In addition to reviewing core human research methods such as interviews, observations, surveys and experiments, it will explore methods used in critical analysis of texts and technologies. It will also discuss mixed method approaches, case studies, participatory and user-centered research, as well as research involving minors. While this book also touches upon statistics and their importance, it is not required a comprehensive knowledge of the subject. It is concluded with a section on experiment results and the ways in which experimental design and statistics can be used to ensure certain results. After completion of this book, reader should understand why research methodology is important in scientific research, be comfortable reading method and results sections of journal articles, and understand a range of different research methods. 
 
After completion of the book, the readers should be able to…
	Understand some basic concepts of research and its methodologies; 
	Identify appropriate research topics; 
	Select and define appropriate research problem and parameters; 
	Effectively conduct literature review; 
	Identify the types of methods best suited for investigating different types of problems and questions; 
	Select sampling methods and how representative samples are obtained; 
	Identify the different research designs and their appropriate application to hypothesis testing; 
	Describe quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods approaches to research; 
	Explain the strengths and limitations of research designs used in different disciplines; 
	Describe the principle of statistical significance; 
	Effectively summarize and present data; 
	Organize and conduct research in a more appropriate manner; 
	Design a research proposal; 
	Write a research report and thesis; 
	Be aware of the ethical principles of research, ethical challenges and approval processes. 

The book focuses on the logic, principles and practices of modern science and how it is applied to understanding the nature of reality. Successful completion of this book will prepare the reader for graduate work and advanced experimental concepts and also enable at a minimum to become an informed consumer of science.
