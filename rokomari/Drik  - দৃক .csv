What begins as a modest attempt to stage an exhibition of muslin dresses soon transforms in to a quest  to recreate the fabric itself and ultimately , to discover one’s own past and an entire nation’s heritage. It leads the author from the fabled riverbanks to the Meghna to the villages where dwindling groups of spinners and weavers practice a vanished art of wooden looms. In between for the searches for long lost cotton seed in Kolkata and the Kew Gardens, peers at muslin collections from Turkey to Switzerland and ponders on the differences in jamdani between the two Bengals .It is a single-minded pursuit that opens up the world of cotton textiles, a world where the past and the future, cotton and colonialism, national narratives and royal haute couture intersect in remarkable ways. The book is also, finally, a compelling tale of camaraderie with the craftspeople, experts, artisans and designers of the world of cotton textiles.",Muslin Our Story,Saiful Islam, , ,Drik,9789843400130,"1st Published,2016",246,Bangladesh,English

We were challenged by being in Dhaka, bringing some of the world’s finest photographers to the capital of Bangladesh - a city which was never considered to be a competitor to Paris, Arles, New York or London, cities so long taken for granted as being the global centres of photography. 
Themed “Transition”, the ninth edition of the festival comes with a new question of purpose. Where do we stand today after eight previous incarnations? What has been established around the medium? What happens when we reacquaint ourselves with our language? Today, Chobi Mela continues to question the usual models and proposes alternatives, through the work of 37 artists.

Despite all the things that are not right in our nation there is much reason there is much reason for hope this rich, nuanced, insightful look at our community is the look of pride of a nation with self-belief. It celebrates both the power of photography and it celebrates the power of our photography. By embracing the amateur, it also ensures that the most dynamic of art forms will not merely be a playing for the elite and that the trans formative power of the medium will be an agent for positive changes. This anniversary book, the first of a series presenting Bangladesh today, is an ode to photography and Bangladesh seen from within.
It is also a celebration of life.

It is the first volume in a five-part series; the series title “Exercising Freedom” captures well what drives her to write. Freedom is neither an abstraction nor a commodity Gramsci, the Italian Marxist, she writes, even if objective for freedom exists, it is does not mean people are necessarily free. Freedom must be thought of as a possibility; it is a reality but only one of several. To move towards the future desired, one must move beyond thinking of freedom as a legal right, one must enact freedom instead of (merely) having aspirations for freedom.
The first piece, written during a state of emergency levied by the military-installed caretaker government (2007-2008), details the gruesome torture which the joint forces had subjected adivasi leader Choles Ritchil to, leading to his death. In a later piece, written post-emergency, she proposes re-thinking the coinage, “military-installed caretaker government”. She argues that “consortium government” is more appropriate since the Fakhruddin –Moeenuddin caretaker government was constituted by a combination of national and international forces- the military leadership, shusheel shomaj (civil society by design), and Western diplomats.

The final piece in the collection, a public lecture, engages with what reclaiming life in times of death-a never- ending “war on terror” aimed at encompassing the world –involves, when university campuses are marked by intellectual subservience: the fifteenth amendment to the constitution which declared all citizens of Bangladesh to be “Bengalis” was not collectively challenged by public and private universities, as it should have been, in the interest of academic freedom renowned development agency, committed to eradicating poverty globally turns a blind eye to occupational and its horrors( depleted uranium and the desecration of corpses) while working in Afghanistan. When the US government‘s account of 9/11 is full of unexplainable holes including suicide-hijackers who happen to be alive. Inspired by Begum Rokeya and Martin Luther King, Jr. she urges us to discover the meaning of life through disturbing the status quo, for therein lies the possibility of freedom.",Tortured Truths, ,Rahnuma Ahamed, ,Drik,9789843377418,"1st Published,2013",500,Bangladesh,English

Not all of them are poor. Many are skilled and well educated. Still, the possibility of changing one’s destiny is the single driving force that pushes people into precarious journeys all across the globe. They see it not merely as a means for economic freedom, but also as a means for social mobility.
The book undertakes a holistic view of the migration of Bangladeshis to Malaysia. It attempts to create a better understanding of the complex issues surrounding migration, and looks pragmatically at integration and re-integration. It analyses the social, economic, legal and cultural environments under which migration takes place.",The Best Year Of My Life Migrants In Malaysis,Shahidul Alam, , ,Drik,9789843413475,"1st Published,2016", ,Bangladesh,English

This story is about the most delicate and beautiful fabric that the world had ever seen. This cloth was created by poor, unknown but highly gifted rural artisans in villages around Dhaka. They used threads made from a special cotton plant called ‘phuti karpas’ which only grew along the banks of the Meghna and Sitalakhaya river. It was known as ‘mul-mul’ in India and ‘muslin’ by foreigners. Muslin was worn by famous kings and queens from the 8th to the 18th century and traded from Rome to Indonesia. It was ultimately destroyed by the English colonialists in the mid-19th century to support their own machine-made cloth. Today most of this cloth is in foreign museums and our country Bangladesh has very few examples. Today, jamdani is the only living representation of muslin though it is not made from the unique cotton. We want to bring you the exciting story of muslin and the history of its glory, its royal use and its sad death. We hope that the phuti karpas, its silken threads and the traditional weaving process will return again. Today our skilled weavers are again weaving cloth similar to muslin. Together, we must not let Bangladesh’s heritage be lost forever.",In The Land Of Muslin (Comic Book),Saiful Islam, , ,Drik,9789843414809,"1st Published,2016", ,Bangladesh,English
