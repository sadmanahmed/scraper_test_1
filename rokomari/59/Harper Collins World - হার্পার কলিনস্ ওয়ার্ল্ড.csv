Well into their married lives, they realize that none of them had a bachelor party before their weddings. But it's never too late to set things right. They go about planning their belated bachelor party - a Euro trip which, well, ends up becoming the trip of their lifetime.
Picture this: It's the middle of the night. The four friends wait to be strip-searched by the border police. They are stuck in the no man's land between Croatia and Slovenia - without valid visas, but with banned party drugs and a rifle cartridge... Welcome to one hell of a reunion!
