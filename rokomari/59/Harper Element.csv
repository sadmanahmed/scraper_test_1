How To Talk To Anyone: 92 Little Tricks For Big Success In Relationships is an informative and witty guide that takes its readers through 92 ways of enhancing their communication skills in gatherings, whether personal or professional.

We have all been to gatherings and seen successful people talk like they have it all figured out. They chat confidently with others, have the best jobs, most interesting friends, and the nicest partners. But they are able to do all this not because they’re smarter or better looking than others. It’s because they have learnt the art of communicating skilfully with others. The readers of this guide will come across 92 techniques that will develop this skill.

The author Leil Lowndes uses wit and irreverence when talking about relationships in this book of tips and techniques. She also talks about body language and how people relate to each other. The techniques outlined in this book are usable across scenarios, including in love and business.

The readers will learn how to use certain gestures to charm their audience, be glued to the other person through their eyes, how to give great compliments and the frequency at which they should be given, empathizing effectively with others, how to make their presence felt at a party, like making a grand entrance, how to be the one that chooses and not the one who gets chosen, and for the foodies, mingling instead of munching.

All this wisdom is packed across the pages of How To Talk To Anyone: 92 Little Tricks For Big Success In Relationships. Each little trick is presented in the form of a chapter. There are 9 parts in all, starting with You Only Have Ten Seconds to Show You’re a Somebody and ending with Little Tricks of Big Winners. There’s an additional chapter at the end, called A Final Word: Your Destiny.

Very little is known about Jesus in his formative years. In the Gospel stories, V we witness the birth of Jesus and then see him as a young boy of twelve, intensely questioning the Rabbis in the Second Temple in Jerusalem. He does not reappear until age thirty when he emerges as the potent and stirring rebel baptized by John at the River Jordan. What happened to Jesus in those lost years? How did Jesus the boy become Christ the Saviour? 
These are the questions that motivate bestselling writer Deepak Chopra to attempt a fresh re-imagining of a young man's transformational journey from carpenter's son to revolutionary leader to spiritual saviour. From his unceremonious birth in Bethlehem to the ultimate betrayal by his friend Judas in Jerusalem, Chopra captures the life of one of the world's most written about men, as never before.","Jesus The Story of Enlightenment (The New York Times bestselling author of Buddha captures the extraordinary life of Jesus in this surprising,soul-stirring,and page-turning novel.)",Deepak Chopra, ,Rajeev Dubey,Harper Element,9789351368144,"1st Edition,2014",274,India,English

If Truth be Told is an extraordinary memoir of the making of a spiritual life in today’s demanding, competitive, and baffling times. The book unravels the life story of Om Swami and his journey to becoming a monk. As an 18-year-old young boy, Om Swami headed to Australia to realize his worldly dreams and aspirations. He struggled to make his ends meet but two years down the line he was a multimillionaire earning $250,000 a year. He always had a burning desire to explore his spirituality. As an 8-year-old he saw a vision of God in a dream which transformed his life forever. This triggered off his desire to meet God and he practiced astrology, meditation and tantra in his pursuit to know God. Yet God was nowhere in sight, deeply frustrated he plunged into the worldly affairs to distract himself from the restlessness and commotion within. After spending several years in Australia he moved to India and led his life in solitude in the Himalayas. He battled death as he starved, faced the wrath of nature and wild animals. But finally his sadhana brought him to the ultimate realization – I am what I have been seeking, which became the basis of all his teachings. This astounding memoir is a must-read for those interested in the life and teachings of Om Swami.

Manuscript Found In Accra,পাওলো কোয়েলহো,TK. 535,"",https://rokomari.com//book/101097/manuscript-found-in-accra,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/rokimg_20150725_101097.gif,"Summary of The book

The main subject of The Manuscript Found In Accra is an ancient (fictitious) manuscript containing words of wisdom from an unnamed Copt.

The narrator of the book is a the son of an English archaeologist, who is translating an ancient document. The document he says, was found in a cave in Cairo. It seems to be a recording of the words of a wise man, which had been recorded faithfully by one of his audience.

The Manuscript Found In Accra has an interesting setup. The incident takes place on the eve of the invasion of Jerusalem by European crusaders. Threatened by these alien invaders, in peril of life and livelihood, the citizens of Jerusalem are gathered together around a Copt. He is standing in their midst, patiently answering their questions. In a few hours time, the city would be overrun by the invaders from Europe.

The Copt has summoned the people to this place. He asks them to forget about the looming peril for the time being and ponder their minds on everyday concerns rather than the coming destruction. So, he urges them to ask him questions about issues that bother them in their normal, everyday life, doubts and concerns that are in their minds now and will be in their minds after the invaders have gone.

There is a bit of quiet in the atmosphere upon hearing such a declaration. The people of the city, including Coptic Christians, Jews, and Muslims, all eagerly gather before this quiet man, who seems unmoved by any fears of the future. The impending catastrophe is just a setting. The Manuscript Found In Accra is not a novel, it contains only a set of questions and answers. The citizens put various questions before the wise man, and he answers them all, and a scribe records everything.
