A novel rich in metaphors and symbolism, The Alchemist is a story based on the adventures of a young shepherd boy, who, upon deciding to follow his prophetic dreams, sets on a treasure hunt. This journey introduces him to some remarkable people who leave an indelible and profound mark on him.  

Summary Of The Book: 
The Alchemist was first published in 1988. The protagonist of the story, a young Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago, is plagued with recurring dreams, wherein a mysterious child urges him to look for buried treasure at the base of the Egyptian pyramids. Determined, he leaves Spain and heads towards Egypt. En route, he meets the King of Salem, a man named Melchizedek. Melchizedek introduces Santiago to the concept of a ‘Personal Legend’ or a personal map or a quest that guides him to what his heart truly desires.
While attempting to cross the Sahara desert on the way to Egypt, he joins a caravan which is driven by an Englishman who is aspiring to be an alchemist. During a stop over in Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets Fatima, a young girl of exceeding beauty who steals his heart. He asks her to marry him, but she declines saying that she will do so only once he has found the treasure he seeks. In the Saharan oasis of Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets a 200 year old alchemist who decides to accompany him on his expedition. He imparts wisdom and valuable knowledge to Santiago, who eventually understands why the supposed treasure keeps evading him.
Having sold over 65 million copies worldwide, The Alchemist is marked by its profound simplicity, the easy flow of the story, and the poignant moral it tries to teach the reader, that worldly possessions and extravagance are immaterial when compared to finding your own ‘Personal Legend’.",The Alchemist (About 150 Million Copies Sold),Paulo Coelho, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9788172234980,"1st Edition,2015",192,Abroad,English

Eleven Minutes is the story of Maria, a young girl from a small village in Brazil. She is disillusioned by her failures in love. She moves to Geneva, Switzerland, aspiring to live the life of her dreams - a life filled with fame and fortune. Her dreams are shattered when she is introduced to the harsh realities of life.

One day, a chance encounter with an Arab man earns her a thousand francs for one night. Lured by the prospect of easy money, she ends up becoming a prostitute in a brothel in Geneva’s red-light district. Once there, she quickly learns the ropes and becomes quite successful, not to mention the envy of her colleagues. She shuts the door on love and only has time for the demands made by her body.

Her life is thrown into disarray when she meets a young Swiss painter named Ralf. She falls in love with Ralf, who is completely different from her. Her carnal feelings for Ralf and her true love for him vie for supremacy. She finally decides to move away from Geneva because she sees no future for them. But just before she leaves, she discovers the beautiful blend of sex and true love with Ralf.

Maria’s journey begins with disillusionment. It brings about her sexual awakening and eventually, almost brings her to the point of self-destruction. She sinks to the depths of despair before her phoenix-like rise to self-discovery and the heights of love.

Maria’s story explores the concepts of sex, prostitution, sadomasochism, and true love.

Eleven Minutes was published in 2003. It was originally written in Portuguese, and has been translated into several languages since then.

Currently ranked World No. 1 in women's doubles, Sania Mirza became an instant sensation when she won the Wimbledon Championships girls' doubles title at the age of sixteen. From 2003 until her retirement from the singles circuit in 2012, she was ranked by the Women's Tennis Association as India's top player, both in singles and doubles. A six-time Grand Slam champion, she notched up an incredible forty-one consecutive wins with her doubles partner, Martina Hingis, between August 2015 and February 2016.

Ace against Odds is the story of this most iconic Indian player who beat incredible odds to get to the top of her sport. Sania writes with candour of the hardships along the way, of the physical and emotional trauma caused by injuries and medical procedures, of the friends and partners who became her mainstay along with her family, of the pressures of constant public scrutiny and, not least, the politics and heartbreaks that inevitably accompany success.

Sania broke the rules, she spoke her mind, she pushed herself to the limit, she played for India fiercely and without care for how it might impact her rankings - she is and will continue to remain an inspiration long after she steps off the tennis courts.(goodreads.com)",Ace Against Odds,Sania Mirza, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789351362630,"1st Edition,2016",288,India,English

As she feels that nothing can fill this void she decides one fine day that she is going to die and consumes several sleeping pills. While she is surprised to find herself still alive when she wakes up in a local mental hospital, she is told that her wish to die will come true in a matter of days as the overdose on the pills has caused irreparable damage to her heart. 
However, it is in these last few days of life that Veronika starts to actually appreciate things around her. She starts to feel things that she has never felt before like: love, fear, hatred, sexual awakening and curiosity.

Looking For Alaska, John Green’s debut novel was first published in 2005. Looking For Alaska follows the life of Miles Halter, as he leaves Florida to join boarding school in Alabama. He joins Culver Creek, the boarding school, later than usual, as he himself mentions that he is looking for a “Great Perhaps”.

Among his quirks include memorizing the last words of famous people and the “Great Perhaps” was that of Francois Rabelais. Miles receives the nickname Pudge in school, and though his was a figure that was nothing like the name entailed, it stuck.

His roommate and friend is Chip, who is the person who introduces him to Alaska Young, the Alaska mentioned in the title of the story. The adventures that they are involved in together cause him to fall in love with Alaska, and the entire book is written in first person. Most of the book is written as a countdown to a specific occurrence, which occurs in the rest of the book and it is easy to gather from the title, what this section would cover.

Though mostly mature and insightful, readers often get a peek into the sex addled mind of a sixteen year old school student, one who is forever counting the number of layers of clothing separating him from the bare body of the girl he is presently with.

Looking For Alaska won the 2006 Michael L. Printz Award from the American Library Association. It broke into the New York Times Bestseller list at number 10 in 2012, much after its debut in 2005. The film rights to the book have been sold to Paramount Pictures, though the project hasn’t been greenlighted yet due to lack of sufficient interest.

Hercule Poirot finds himself the uninvited guest at the scene of an elaborately planned murder on wheels. The Belgian detective is making his way from Istanbul, Turkey, to London, and he is looking forward to a leisurely trip and a chance to clear his head, a chance to rest his “little grey cells,” as Poirot refers to his brain.

A good friend of Poirot, M. Bouc, is an administrator with Wagon Lit, the train company that operates the Orient Express. Poirot prefers to travel first class. Because it is winter, off season for tourists, the detective is assured by Bouc that finding a first-class cabin on the train will be easy. To their surprise, the car leaving Istanbul, the Calais Coach, is nearly full. There is, however, one no-show, and Poirot finds himself sharing a compartment with Hector MacQueen, the private secretary to a wealthy American, Mr. Ratchett.

Poirot is introduced by Bouc to Dr. Constantine, a Greek physician, traveling in the next car. On the first night of the journey, as they sit in the dining car, Bouc points out to Poirot the variety of travelers in the dining car: the rich and the poor. Some are English, some American, some French, some Italian, some Russian, some Hungarian—an array of passengers from differing socioeconomic backgrounds and different cultures. Where else in the world, Bouc wonders aloud, could one find such an assortment of people beneath one roof? Yes, Poirot thinks to himself, perhaps only in America.

The first night passes peacefully, and Bouc moves Poirot from his shared cabin with MacQueen to a private one next door to Ratchett. During the second night of the trip, Poirot has trouble sleeping, awakened by voices, service bells summoning conductor Pierre Michel, and thumping on his cabin door. At about 1:15 a.m., Poirot sticks his head out of his cabin and sees a woman wearing a kimono with a dragon print walking down the corridor. He hears his neighbor, Ratchett, tell the conductor in perfect French that nothing is wrong and that he had not meant to ring his service bell. The train is stopped, too, as an avalanche of snow covers the tracks.

Ratchett, Poirot has determined, is an evil man. The evil shows on his face, and Poirot has taken an instant dislike in him. Earlier in the evening, Poirot had been approached by Ratchett and was offered a job—to keep Ratchett alive. Ratchett has been receiving hate mail and otherwise threatening letters.

This book, Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges, takes up the story from when A.P.J Abdul Kalam became the President of India. It covers his acceptance of the post of the President of India, his term in office, his efforts to make his term meaningful, and the challenges he faced.

His term from 2002 to 2007 was an eventful one. The President of India is just a titular head with minimal powers. But, the office is one of great influence and Kalam used it to best effect. He got the government and the public to focus on issues that were relevant to the country's all round growth.

He initiated programs like PURA to try and integrate rural areas into the general economic and technological growth of the country. He dreamt of taking the whole of India on his vision for the country in the new millennium, and he saw no reason why the villages should be left out in this vision.

Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges is more about Kalam’s vision for his country rather than about himself. He tries to provide a blueprint for development, and for reforms in the government and judiciary.

Dr.Kalam is a strong advocate for the use of technology and a proponent of e-governance. Even the little bits of personal experience during his term that he gives, he links with these ideas. For instance, he mentions the controversial dissolution of the Bihar assembly for which he later offered to resign. But, he does not focus on the political or personal implications of this decision, instead, he chose to highlight his use of electronic communication in lending his approval to this move, for he was in Moscow at that time.

He made the office of the President accessible to the public. He used his popularity and high visibility to inspire the youth of the country and convince them to believe in his 2020 vision for India. He urged the young people to dream big, and to believe in their country's destiny. Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges describes the term in office of one of the most charismatic Presidents of the country.

Winning, published in 2010, is a self-help management guide to help readers find answers to some of the most difficult questions of their professional lives. Winning starts off with an introduction, where Jack Welch says that the most commonly asked question is, What does it take to win?

The first part of the book, Underneath It All, describes Jack’s management philosophy. The author says that an organization should take ideas from every level, and not just the top leaders. The next part is titled Your Company, and focuses on the inner working of an organization. The authors speak about leadership, hiring, how to part ways, and crisis management. Your Competition is the third portion of Winning, and it speaks about the world outside of an organization.

Readers will learn how to devise meaningful budgets, grow through mergers and acquisitions, create strategic advantages, and make use of Six Sigma. In Your Career, the authors encourage readers to find the right job, to understand what it takes to get promoted, and learn how to handle a bad boss. Winning also says that maintaining a good work-life balance is essential. The last part, Tying Up Loose Ends, answers nine questions that do not fall in the above categories, like managing the China threat.

Winning is filled with personal stories and experiences, and has been written with a no-nonsense attitude. This book offers no easy solutions on how to win, as there really are none. This guide was on the top of The Wall Street Journal bestseller list, and has also been on The New York Times' bestseller list.

Balram Halwai narrates his life in a letter, written in seven consecutive nights and addressed to the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao. In his letter, Balram explains how he, the son of a puller, escaped a life of servitude to become a successful businessman, describing himself as an entrepreneur.

Balram was born in the rural village of Laxmangarh, where he lived with his grandmother, parents, brother and extended family. He is a smart child but is forced to leave school in order to help pay for his cousin's dowry and begins to work in a teashop with his brother in Dhanbad. While working there he begins to learn about India's government and economy from the customers' conversations. Balram describes himself as a bad servant but a good listener and decides to become a driver.

After learning how to drive, Balram finds a job driving Ashok, the son of one of Laxmangarh's landlords. He takes over the job of the main driver, from a small car to a heavy-luxury described Honda City. He stops sending money back to his family and disrespects his grandmother during a trip back to his village. Balram moves to New Delhi with Ashok and his wife Pinky Madam. Throughout their time in Delhi, Balram is exposed to extensive corruption, especially in the government. In Delhi, the contrast between the poor and the wealthy is made even more evident by their proximity to one another.

One night Pinky Madam takes the wheel from Balram, while drunk, hits something in the road and drives away; we are left to assume that she has killed a child. Ashok's family puts pressure on Balram to confess that he had been driving alone. Ashok becomes increasingly involved in bribing government officials for the benefit of the family coal business. Balram then decides that killing Ashok will be the only way to escape India's Rooster Coop. After bludgeoning Ashok with a bottle and stealing a large bribe, Balram moves to Bangalore, where he bribes the police in order to help start his own taxi business. Ashok too is portrayed to be trapped in the metaphorical Rooster Coop: his family controls what he does and society dictates how he acts. Just like Ashok, Balram pays off a family whose son one of his taxi drivers hit and killed. Balram explains that his own family was almost certainly killed by Ashok's relatives as retribution for his murder. At the end of the novel, Balram rationalizes his actions and considers that his freedom is worth the lives of his family and of Ashok. And thus ends the letter to Jiabao, letting the reader think of the dark humour of the tale, as well as the idea of life as a trap introduced by the writer.(wiki)",The White Tiger,Aravind Adiga, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789352645060,"Reprinted,2017",324,India,English

Pointing to the horizon where the sea and sky are joined, he says, ‘It is only an illusion because they can’t really meet, but isn’t it beautiful, this union which isn’t really there.’ – SAADAT HASAN MANTO Sometime in 2016, a series of dialogues took place which set out to find a meeting ground, even if only an illusion, between A.S. Dulat and Asad Durrani. One was a former chief of RAW, India’s external intelligence agency, the other of ISI, its Pakistani counterpart. As they could not meet in their home countries, the conversations, guided by journalist Aditya Sinha, took place in cities like Istanbul, Bangkok and Kathmandu. On the table were subjects that have long haunted South Asia, flashpoints that take lives regularly. It was in all ways a deep dive into the politics of the subcontinent, as seen through the eyes of two spymasters. Among the subjects: Kashmir, and a missed opportunity for peace; Hafiz Saeed and 26/11; Kulbhushan Jadhav; surgical strikes; the deal for Osama bin Laden; how the US and Russia feature in the India-Pakistan relationship; and how terror undermines the two countries’ attempts at talks. When the project was first mooted, General Durrani laughed and said nobody would believe it even if it was written as fiction. At a time of fraught relations, this unlikely dialogue between two former spy chiefs from opposite sides-a project that is the first of its kind-may well provide some answers.

How is it, then, that today the former British colonial trading post is a thriving Asian metropolis with not only the world's number one airline, best airport, and busiest port of trade, but also the world's fourth–highest per capita real income?

The story of that transformation is told here by Singapore's charismatic, controversial founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. Rising from a legacy of divisive colonialism, the devastation of the Second World War, and general poverty and disorder following the withdrawal of foreign forces, Singapore now is hailed as a city of the future. This miraculous history is dramatically recounted by the man who not only lived through it all but who fearlessly forged ahead and brought about most of these changes.

Delving deep into his own meticulous notes, as well as previously unpublished government papers and official records, Lee details the extraordinary efforts it took for an island city–state in Southeast Asia to survive at that time.

Lee explains how he and his cabinet colleagues finished off the communist threat to the fledgling state's security and began the arduous process of nation building: forging basic infrastructural roads through a land that still consisted primarily of swamps, creating an army from a hitherto racially and ideologically divided population, stamping out the last vestiges of colonial–era corruption, providing mass public housing, and establishing a national airline and airport.

In this illuminating account, Lee writes frankly about his trenchant approach to political opponents and his often unorthodox views on human rights, democracy, and inherited intelligence, aiming always ""to be correct, not politically correct."" Nothing in Singapore escaped his watchful eye: whether choosing shrubs for the greening of the country, restoring the romance of the historic Raffles Hotel, or openly, unabashedly persuading young men to marry women as well educated as themselves. Today's safe, tidy Singapore bears Lee's unmistakable stamp, for which he is unapologetic: ""If this is a nanny state, I am proud to have fostered one.""

Though Lee's domestic canvas in Singapore was small, his vigor and talent assured him a larger place in world affairs. With inimitable style, he brings history to life with cogent analyses of some of the greatest strategic issues of recent times and reveals how, over the years, he navigated the shifting tides of relations among America, China, and Taiwan, acting as confidant, sounding board, and messenger for them. He also includes candid, sometimes acerbic pen portraits of his political peers, including the indomitable Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, the poetry–spouting Jiang Zemin, and ideologues George Bush and Deng Xiaoping.

Lee also lifts the veil on his family life and writes tenderly of his wife and stalwart partner, Kwa Geok Choo, and of their pride in their three children –– particularly the eldest son, Hsien Loong, who is now Singapore's deputy prime minister.

For more than three decades, Lee Kuan Yew has been praised and vilified in equal measure, and he has established himself as a force impossible to ignore in Asian and international politics. From Third World to First offers readers a compelling glimpse into this visionary's heart, soul, and mind.",From Third World to First,Lee Kuan Yew, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780060197766,1st Edition,752,Abroad,English

Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain. 

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end. 
This novel has been greatly appreciated by its readers, being labeled as the most important book of the 20th century by the Children’s Books Of The Century poll, published in Books For Keeps. Although the exact number is not known, there have been 35-100 million copies of The Hobbit sold, till date, since it’s publishing in the year 1937. The Hobbit has also been adapted into a movie, whose first part, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey released in the United States on the 14th of December 2012. This movie was directed by Peter Jackson, and the second, and third parts are scheduled to release in 2013, and 2014.

A prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity set in the Sundarbans, an immense labyrinth of tiny islands on the easternmost coast of India.

The Hungry Tide is a very contemporary story of adventure and unlikely love, identity and history, set in one of the most fascinating regions on the earth. Off the easternmost coast of India, in the Bay of Bengal, lies the immense labyrinth of tiny islands known as the Sundarbans. 

For settlers here, life is extremely precarious. Attacks by deadly tigers are common. Unrest and eviction are constant threats. Without warning, at any time, tidal floods rise and surge over the land, leaving devastation in their wake. In this place of vengeful beauty, the lives of three people from different worlds collide. Piya Roy is a young marine biologist, of Indian descent but stubbornly American, in search of a rare, endangered river dolphin. 

Her journey begins with a disaster, when she is thrown from a boat into crocodile-infested waters. Rescue comes in the form of a young, illiterate fisherman, Fokir. Although they have no language between them, Piya and Fokir are powerfully drawn to each other, sharing an uncanny instinct for the ways of the sea. Piya engages Fokir to help with her research and finds a translator in Kanai Dutt, a businessman from Delhi whose idealistic aunt and uncle are longtime settlers in the Sundarbans. 

As the three of them launch into the elaborate backwaters, they are drawn unawares into the hidden undercurrents of this isolated world, where political turmoil exacts a personal toll that is every bit as powerful as the ravaging tide. Already an international success, The Hungry Tide is a prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity.",The Hungry Tide,Amitav Ghosh, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780007432974,"1st Edition,2004",403,Abroad,English

Sidney Sheldon’s Tell Me Your Dreams introduces three very different women at the onset of the novel. Introduced first is Ashley Peterson, a beautiful young woman who works for a computer company in Silicon Valley. Ashley is single and convinced she is being stalked. Readers next meet Ashley’s co-workers, Toni and Alette. Toni Prescott, a British woman in her early twenties is rather bold and striking. Rounding out the trio is Alette Peters, a quiet, dreamy romantic who moved to California from Rome. In the early stages of the novel, quite a few murders are committed and police in Chicago, San Francisco, and Quebec are desperate to solve the gruesome crimes that have taken place in each of their cities. Conclusive evidence points to one suspect and one suspect alone.

As the story develops, the reader learns why Ashley feels so alone in the world. She is the only child of a world-famous heart surgeon, who is often critical and overbearing. Although Ashley loves her father, she does not necessarily love his company and tries to avoid him. Toni is a provocateur with a penchant for song who suffered a strained relationship with her mother. Alette is a gifted artist who lacks self-confidence. As the novel draws to a conclusion, Ashley, Toni, and Alette are proven to be one in the same.

The reader will not be disappointed with Sheldon’s storytelling upon finishing this book. Sheldon provides a fascinating and precise examination of the different aspects of multiple personality disorder through the characters of Ashley, Toni, and Alette. He expertly draws the reader into his story, just as a fly is drawn into a spider’s web. Although this novel was a great effort, it is not one of Sheldon’s best—as portions of the plot are predictable. Sheldon’s ending, however, does have some panache.

The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd,আগাথা ক্রিস্টি,"",TK. 538,https://rokomari.com//book/129560/the-murder-of-roger-ackroyd,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/5db93ac69_129560.jpg,"'The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd' Summary of the book
The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was Christie’s sixth novel and was published in 1926. It was the third novel that featured the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Like many of her other novels, the book is set in a small town and focuses on the interactions between characters who are well known to one another.

When the novel was first published, critical reactions were mixed because of the unusual narrative structure. Christie chose to have the murderer tell the story from his point of view. This device caused some consternation because some believed that Christie was not “playing fair” with her readers. They reasoned that, in crime fiction, if the novel is to be fair, the reader should be able to follow the same path the detective does in order to solve the crime. Some believed that by having the narrator as the murderer, the reader would not be able to follow the path of the clues, since the murderer would, in order to protect his identity, conceal certain key pieces of information.

Christie circumvents this problem in several ways. First, Dr. Sheppard is an extremely believable character. Because of the remorseful tone he assumes at the beginning of the novel, the reader immediately trusts him and his observations. In addition, Poirot appears to trust Sheppard, including him in discussions with the police and, as Poirot admits, using Sheppard as a substitute for Captain Hastings, who had played Dr. Watson to Poirot’s Sherlock Holmes in previous novels. Thus, the reader is led to trust Sheppard because Poirot trusts him.

Sheppard also establishes an intimate rapport with the reader through the use of first-person narrative. The reader is privy to what are assumed to be the doctor’s private thoughts about Ackroyd’s murder. Poirot also confides in Sheppard and often asks his opinion of people within the town. Again, this action on the part of Christie serves to inspire confidence in the narrator; the reader does not suspect him because Poirot does not, and because Christie has, as in previous novels, established Poirot as a reliable source and a good judge of human nature.

Another aspect to the novel in regard to the narration is the comparatively small role that Poirot plays. The reader is accustomed to seeing him as the main character—almost as a master puppeteer who guides the movements of all around him. In fact, the readers expect Poirot to manipulate them, for this is the nature of crime fiction in general: The reader is manipulated by the detective to see things his or her way. Christie, however, chooses to radically depart from this formula. Instead of Poirot manipulating the reader, Sheppard manipulates both the reader and Poirot. The reader is unaware of this subterfuge, however, until the end of the novel, when all the other probable suspects have been eliminated and only Sheppard remains. The reader is then privy to Sheppard’s confession, and all the pieces to this very complex puzzle fall into place.

We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.

What’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.

Now, in Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom—and even of hope itself.

With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.",Everything Is F*cked: A Book About Hope,Mark Manson, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780062955951,"1st Published,2019",274,India,English

Soon after arriving at his hotel in Istanbul, private investigator Hercule Poirot is instructed to return to London immediately. He boards the Orient Express that very night and is accosted by Mr. Ratchett, whom he had earlier seen in his hotel in Istanbul. He attempts to hire Poirot believing that his life is under threat, but the detective refuses him outright.

On the second night of the journey, a snowdrift brings the train to a halt. A cry from Ratchett’s coach pierces the eerie silence of the night. The next morning, M. Bouc, the director of the company that operates the train and an acquaintance of Poirot, informs him of the shocking murder of Ratchett. Upon his request, Poirot agrees to investigate the case. Soon Poirot learns of Ratchett’s questionable past and the probable reasons for his murder.

In the United States a few years earlier, Daisy Armstrong, a 3 year old heiress was kidnapped and killed by a man, who went by the name Cassetti, in spite of collecting a ransom from her wealthy family. Suspected to have rigged the trial, Cassetti fled the country after his acquittal. Poirot came to the conclusion that Ratchett was none other than Cassetti.

What connects the people in Ratchett’s coach who were travelling with him on that fateful night of the murder? Is one of the members of the Armstrong family the murderer?

Murder on the Orient Express has been adapted to TV, film and radio as well. The book was first published in 1934.

#1 New York Times Bestseller!

In the second book of the Carve the Mark duology, globally bestselling Divergent author Veronica Roth reveals how Cyra and Akos fulfill their fates. The Fates Divide is a richly imagined tale of hope and resilience told in four stunning perspectives.

The lives of Cyra Noavek and Akos Kereseth are ruled by their fates, spoken by the oracles at their births. The fates, once determined, are inescapable.

Akos is in love with Cyra, in spite of his fate: He will die in service to Cyra’s family. And when Cyra’s father, Lazmet Noavek—a soulless tyrant, thought to be dead—reclaims the Shotet throne, Akos believes his end is closer than ever.

As Lazmet ignites a barbaric war, Cyra and Akos are desperate to stop him at any cost. For Cyra, that could mean taking the life of the man who may—or may not—be her father. For Akos, it could mean giving his own. In a stunning twist, the two will discover how fate defines their lives in ways most unexpected.

The Fifth Mountain is set in the year 870 BC. Israel is being ruled by Phoenicians and Queen Jezebel wants to ensure that the people follow her own faith, one she brought from her native land. So, she orders the death of all those who do not bow down to her God, Baal.

One of these rebels is the Prophet Elijah. The Queen orders his death for refusing to obey her. Elijah flees to the lovely Phoenician city of Zarephath, which is also known by the Phoenician name of Akbar. This place was actually considered to be the abode of the God, though Elijah refused to acknowledge it.

There he meets a woman who is a worshipper of Baal. Though their religious views differ and she is older than him, Elijah and the woman are attracted to each other. But they don't discuss their feelings openly. Meanwhile, Elijah, who has been sent to this place by an angel, wants to rid Israel of the tyranny of Queen Jezebel.

But due to a surprising turn of events, the people of Akbar accept him as a sage. They consider him one of their own and come to him for advice and to settle disputes. As Elijah begins to bond with these people, he suffers from conflicting ambitions. He cannot decide whether to remain in Akbar, his adopted city, or to return to Israel. Subsequently, the destructive Assyrian invasion on Akbar worsens Elijah’s dilemma.
In The Fifth Mountain, through the context of a religious tale, the author conveys the importance of finding one's own destiny, even if it seems like it will involve rebelling against God's will. He insists that in doing so, one will find oneself getting closer to God.

Cards on the Table is a detective novel by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 2 November 1936 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence and the US edition at $2.00.

The book features the recurring characters of Hercule Poirot, Colonel Race, Superintendent Battle and the bumbling crime writer Ariadne Oliver, making her first appearance in a Poirot novel. The four detectives and four possible suspects play bridge after dinner with Mr Shaitana. At the end of the evening, Mr Shaitana is discovered murdered. Identifying the murderer, per Mrs Christie, depends wholly on discerning the psychology of the suspects.

This novel was well received at first printing and in later reviews. It was noted for its humour, for the subtlety of the writing, good clueing and tight writing, showing continuing improvement in the author's writing style in this, her twentieth novel. One later reviewer considered this in the top rung of her novels, and another found it to be most original, with a brilliant surprise ending.

In this compilation of eight marvellous short stories, Agatha Christie delights readers with the presence of her three male sleuths in six respective stories. Two stories each for Parker Pyne, the duo Harley Quin-Satterthwaite and Hercule Poirot ‘the police hound.’ In the two other, two women on a crossroads of their life are faced with difficult decision to make.


The map of Majorca, Spain where Parker Pyne has to resolve a rift between two women while on holiday.

Presumably first appeared in the UK magazines, seven of them were written in the twenties and in the  thirties. Only The Harlequin Tea Set was in 1971. Interestingly, the copyright of five of them were signed as Mrs. Mallowan; hence after her divorce in 1928.

Poirot’s cases concern with a reconstruction of a suicide and the death of an old eccentric well-to-do man who summons the Belgian to his home. In the former story, it starts when he receives a telephone call from a mysterious woman begging for his help. ‘…table with yellow irises,’ she sounds frightened  of being overheard. In the latter, a shot is heard moments after the first gong for dinner but a guest firmly believes of having heard the second gong. Four years later the same plot appears in Dead Man’s Mirror (see Notes On The Murder In The Mews) with alterations to the character names.

In the non-detective stories, two female protagonists must make her choice. On the one hand, it is between a dog or starvation in Next To A Dog; the dog being the very memory of a dead husband. On the other, Theodora Darrel undergoes a battle of will between loyalty vs happiness. Will she still walk out from her marriage having known that her husband has been in a serious charge of theft and fraud?
The Love Detectives (1926) seems to mark the early appearance of Harley Quin; an enigmatic man of whom his path is crossed with Mr. Satterthwaite’s on a number of occasions (see Notes On The Mysterious Mr. Quin). In a dark night both meets when their car collide; Sattwerthwaite is with Colonel Melrose on their way to a crime scene. An aristocrat has been killed with a bronze figure of Venus. Then his beautiful wife and a male guest whom stays over in the house confess of the murder. Who is one to believe?

Any readers who remember Mrs. Protheroe and Lawrence Redding     will understand what  occurs next in the story (see Notes On The Murder At The Vicarage).  The clock is changed to suit the alibi of a suspect and the study also becomes where the ‘thing’ happens. In Miss Marple’s case, however, the deceased’s wife and her

As the book begins, Athena is dead. How she ended up that way creates the intrigue sustaining the book. The child, Sherine Khalil renames herself Athena after her uncle was discussing with her mother on how her real name will betray her origins and something like Athena gave nothing away. As a child, she shows a strong religious vocation and reports seeing angels and saints, which both impresses and worries her parents.

She goes into a London University to pursue Engineering at the age of 19 but it's not what her heart wanted. One day she just decides that she wanted to drop out of college, get married and have a baby. Here, the author mentions that this might be due to the fact that she was abandoned herself and wants to give all that love she could to her child which she didn't receive from her birth mother. Two years later, her marriage falls apart because they are facing too many problems due to their young age and lack of money or mostly because he felt that she loved only the child and used him to get what she wanted. A very interesting quote she uses is ""From Ancient Greece on, the people who returned from battle were either dead on their shields or stronger, despite or because of their scars. It's better that way: I've lived on a battlefield since I was born, but I'm still alive and I don't need anyone to protect me."" She grows into a woman in search of answers to many questions that arise within a person. She had a life which many felt was content because she had a child of her own, money, and friends; everything but her mind was at peace, so she searches for the answer to the classical question of ""Who am I?"" through many experiences. In her quest, she opens her heart to intoxicating powers of mother and becomes a controversial spiritual leader in London.",The Witch of Portobello,Paulo Coelho, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780007257447,"1st Published,2007",324,India,English

While Ashoke Ganguli is studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the young wife is lost in the alien land with not many around to help her and no friends she could talk to and hang out with. Now, their young boy has to be named by an elder person in the family, as a part of the tradition followed in Bengali families. This honour has been given to Ashima’s grandmother. Due to circumstances, the couple find out that they cannot leave the hospital without naming the child. Ashoke thus chooses the name of his favourite Russian author, Gogol, for time being. But when Ashima’s grandmother passes away before picking a name for her great grandson, the boy remains Gogol. Although he likes his name initially, he starts to dislike it by the time he begins going to high school. And he formally changes his name to Nikhil before leaving for higher studies, and becomes Nikhil Gogol Ganguli. Ashima is extremely unhappy with her son when he starts becoming more of an American, and Ashoke remains quiet about all this until he finds the right time to tell Gogol why he chose that name. The reason behind a name is what constitutes the soul of the story, which changes the young man forever.

Maurice Willson Disher's review in The Times Literary Supplement of 16 January 1943 concluded, ""No crime enthusiast will object that the story of how the painter died has to be told many times, for this, even if it creates an interest which is more problem than plot, demonstrates the author's uncanny skill. The answer to the riddle is brilliant.""

Maurice Richardson was pleased to see the return of Poirot to Christie's works when he reviewed the novel in the 10 January 1943 issue of The Observer. He concluded, ""Despite only five suspects, Mrs. Christie, as usual, puts a ring through the reader's nose and leads him to one of her smashing last-minute showdowns. This is well up to the standard of her middle Poirot period. No more need be said.""

J.D. Beresford in The Guardian's 20 January 1943 review, wrote: ""Miss Agatha Christie never fails us, and her Five Little Pigs presents a very pretty problem for the ingenious reader."" It concluded that the clue to who committed the crime was, ""completely satisfying.""

Robert Barnard: ""The-murder-in-the-past plot on its first and best appearance – accept no later substitutes. Presentation more intricate than usual, characterization more subtle."" All in all, it is a beautifully tailored book, rich and satisfying. The present writer would be willing to chance his arm and say that this is the best Christie of all.""

Summary Of The Book: 
The Alchemist was first published in 1988. The protagonist of the story, a young Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago, is plagued with recurring dreams, wherein a mysterious child urges him to look for buried treasure at the base of the Egyptian pyramids. Determined, he leaves Spain and heads towards Egypt. En route, he meets the King of Salem, a man named Melchizedek. Melchizedek introduces Santiago to the concept of a ‘Personal Legend’ or a personal map or a quest that guides him to what his heart truly desires.
While attempting to cross the Sahara desert on the way to Egypt, he joins a caravan which is driven by an Englishman who is aspiring to be an alchemist. During a stop over in Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets Fatima, a young girl of exceeding beauty who steals his heart. He asks her to marry him, but she declines saying that she will do so only once he has found the treasure he seeks. In the Saharan oasis of Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets a 200 year old alchemist who decides to accompany him on his expedition. He imparts wisdom and valuable knowledge to Santiago, who eventually understands why the supposed treasure keeps evading him.
Having sold over 65 million copies worldwide, The Alchemist is marked by its profound simplicity, the easy flow of the story, and the poignant moral it tries to teach the reader, that worldly possessions and extravagance are immaterial when compared to finding your own ‘Personal Legend’.",The Alchemist (About 150 Million Copies Sold),Paulo Coelho, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9788172234980,"1st Edition,2015",192,Abroad,English

Currently ranked World No. 1 in women's doubles, Sania Mirza became an instant sensation when she won the Wimbledon Championships girls' doubles title at the age of sixteen. From 2003 until her retirement from the singles circuit in 2012, she was ranked by the Women's Tennis Association as India's top player, both in singles and doubles. A six-time Grand Slam champion, she notched up an incredible forty-one consecutive wins with her doubles partner, Martina Hingis, between August 2015 and February 2016.

Ace against Odds is the story of this most iconic Indian player who beat incredible odds to get to the top of her sport. Sania writes with candour of the hardships along the way, of the physical and emotional trauma caused by injuries and medical procedures, of the friends and partners who became her mainstay along with her family, of the pressures of constant public scrutiny and, not least, the politics and heartbreaks that inevitably accompany success.

Sania broke the rules, she spoke her mind, she pushed herself to the limit, she played for India fiercely and without care for how it might impact her rankings - she is and will continue to remain an inspiration long after she steps off the tennis courts.(goodreads.com)",Ace Against Odds,Sania Mirza, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789351362630,"1st Edition,2016",288,India,English

Veronika has everything that a young woman can think of having, but still isn’t satisfied with this as she feels a void within her. As she feels that nothing can fill this void she decides one fine day that she is going to die and consumes several sleeping pills. While she is surprised to find herself still alive when she wakes up in a local mental hospital, she is told that her wish to die will come true in a matter of days as the overdose on the pills has caused irreparable damage to her heart. 
However, it is in these last few days of life that Veronika starts to actually appreciate things around her. She starts to feel things that she has never felt before like: love, fear, hatred, sexual awakening and curiosity.

Looking For Alaska, John Green’s debut novel was first published in 2005. Looking For Alaska follows the life of Miles Halter, as he leaves Florida to join boarding school in Alabama. He joins Culver Creek, the boarding school, later than usual, as he himself mentions that he is looking for a “Great Perhaps”.

Among his quirks include memorizing the last words of famous people and the “Great Perhaps” was that of Francois Rabelais. Miles receives the nickname Pudge in school, and though his was a figure that was nothing like the name entailed, it stuck.

His roommate and friend is Chip, who is the person who introduces him to Alaska Young, the Alaska mentioned in the title of the story. The adventures that they are involved in together cause him to fall in love with Alaska, and the entire book is written in first person. Most of the book is written as a countdown to a specific occurrence, which occurs in the rest of the book and it is easy to gather from the title, what this section would cover.

Though mostly mature and insightful, readers often get a peek into the sex addled mind of a sixteen year old school student, one who is forever counting the number of layers of clothing separating him from the bare body of the girl he is presently with.

Looking For Alaska won the 2006 Michael L. Printz Award from the American Library Association. It broke into the New York Times Bestseller list at number 10 in 2012, much after its debut in 2005. The film rights to the book have been sold to Paramount Pictures, though the project hasn’t been greenlighted yet due to lack of sufficient interest.

After dinner, they’re all charged with their respective crimes by a gramophone recording. They can’t escape their would-be killer, who threatens to kill them in a manner similar to the old nursery rhyme, “ten little Indian boys.” Can they survive this nightmarish episode, or will they be doomed to die for their crimes?

Hercule Poirot finds himself the uninvited guest at the scene of an elaborately planned murder on wheels. The Belgian detective is making his way from Istanbul, Turkey, to London, and he is looking forward to a leisurely trip and a chance to clear his head, a chance to rest his “little grey cells,” as Poirot refers to his brain.

A good friend of Poirot, M. Bouc, is an administrator with Wagon Lit, the train company that operates the Orient Express. Poirot prefers to travel first class. Because it is winter, off season for tourists, the detective is assured by Bouc that finding a first-class cabin on the train will be easy. To their surprise, the car leaving Istanbul, the Calais Coach, is nearly full. There is, however, one no-show, and Poirot finds himself sharing a compartment with Hector MacQueen, the private secretary to a wealthy American, Mr. Ratchett.

Poirot is introduced by Bouc to Dr. Constantine, a Greek physician, traveling in the next car. On the first night of the journey, as they sit in the dining car, Bouc points out to Poirot the variety of travelers in the dining car: the rich and the poor. Some are English, some American, some French, some Italian, some Russian, some Hungarian—an array of passengers from differing socioeconomic backgrounds and different cultures. Where else in the world, Bouc wonders aloud, could one find such an assortment of people beneath one roof? Yes, Poirot thinks to himself, perhaps only in America.

The first night passes peacefully, and Bouc moves Poirot from his shared cabin with MacQueen to a private one next door to Ratchett. During the second night of the trip, Poirot has trouble sleeping, awakened by voices, service bells summoning conductor Pierre Michel, and thumping on his cabin door. At about 1:15 a.m., Poirot sticks his head out of his cabin and sees a woman wearing a kimono with a dragon print walking down the corridor. He hears his neighbor, Ratchett, tell the conductor in perfect French that nothing is wrong and that he had not meant to ring his service bell. The train is stopped, too, as an avalanche of snow covers the tracks.

Ratchett, Poirot has determined, is an evil man. The evil shows on his face, and Poirot has taken an instant dislike in him. Earlier in the evening, Poirot had been approached by Ratchett and was offered a job—to keep Ratchett alive. Ratchett has been receiving hate mail and otherwise threatening letters.

This book, Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges, takes up the story from when A.P.J Abdul Kalam became the President of India. It covers his acceptance of the post of the President of India, his term in office, his efforts to make his term meaningful, and the challenges he faced.

His term from 2002 to 2007 was an eventful one. The President of India is just a titular head with minimal powers. But, the office is one of great influence and Kalam used it to best effect. He got the government and the public to focus on issues that were relevant to the country's all round growth.

He initiated programs like PURA to try and integrate rural areas into the general economic and technological growth of the country. He dreamt of taking the whole of India on his vision for the country in the new millennium, and he saw no reason why the villages should be left out in this vision.

Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges is more about Kalam’s vision for his country rather than about himself. He tries to provide a blueprint for development, and for reforms in the government and judiciary.

Dr.Kalam is a strong advocate for the use of technology and a proponent of e-governance. Even the little bits of personal experience during his term that he gives, he links with these ideas. For instance, he mentions the controversial dissolution of the Bihar assembly for which he later offered to resign. But, he does not focus on the political or personal implications of this decision, instead, he chose to highlight his use of electronic communication in lending his approval to this move, for he was in Moscow at that time.

He made the office of the President accessible to the public. He used his popularity and high visibility to inspire the youth of the country and convince them to believe in his 2020 vision for India. He urged the young people to dream big, and to believe in their country's destiny. Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges describes the term in office of one of the most charismatic Presidents of the country.

About A.P.J. Abdul Kalam

Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is a renowned scientist, writer, administrator and former President of India.

Other books by Dr. Kalam - Developments in Fluid Mechanics and Space Technology, Ignited Minds: Unleashing the Power Within India, The Luminous Sparks, India 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium, and Wings of Fire: An Autobiography.

He has written autobiographies and books that detail his vision for the future of the country.

He then moved to Madras and studied Aerospace Engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology. After finishing his studies, he joined the DRDO’s Aeronautical Development Establishment.

Winning, published in 2010, is a self-help management guide to help readers find answers to some of the most difficult questions of their professional lives. Winning starts off with an introduction, where Jack Welch says that the most commonly asked question is, What does it take to win?

The first part of the book, Underneath It All, describes Jack’s management philosophy. The author says that an organization should take ideas from every level, and not just the top leaders. The next part is titled Your Company, and focuses on the inner working of an organization. The authors speak about leadership, hiring, how to part ways, and crisis management. Your Competition is the third portion of Winning, and it speaks about the world outside of an organization.

Readers will learn how to devise meaningful budgets, grow through mergers and acquisitions, create strategic advantages, and make use of Six Sigma. In Your Career, the authors encourage readers to find the right job, to understand what it takes to get promoted, and learn how to handle a bad boss. Winning also says that maintaining a good work-life balance is essential. The last part, Tying Up Loose Ends, answers nine questions that do not fall in the above categories, like managing the China threat.

Winning is filled with personal stories and experiences, and has been written with a no-nonsense attitude. This book offers no easy solutions on how to win, as there really are none. This guide was on the top of The Wall Street Journal bestseller list, and has also been on The New York Times' bestseller list.

Balram Halwai narrates his life in a letter, written in seven consecutive nights and addressed to the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao. In his letter, Balram explains how he, the son of a puller, escaped a life of servitude to become a successful businessman, describing himself as an entrepreneur.

Balram was born in the rural village of Laxmangarh, where he lived with his grandmother, parents, brother and extended family. He is a smart child but is forced to leave school in order to help pay for his cousin's dowry and begins to work in a teashop with his brother in Dhanbad. While working there he begins to learn about India's government and economy from the customers' conversations. Balram describes himself as a bad servant but a good listener and decides to become a driver.

After learning how to drive, Balram finds a job driving Ashok, the son of one of Laxmangarh's landlords. He takes over the job of the main driver, from a small car to a heavy-luxury described Honda City. He stops sending money back to his family and disrespects his grandmother during a trip back to his village. Balram moves to New Delhi with Ashok and his wife Pinky Madam. Throughout their time in Delhi, Balram is exposed to extensive corruption, especially in the government. In Delhi, the contrast between the poor and the wealthy is made even more evident by their proximity to one another.

One night Pinky Madam takes the wheel from Balram, while drunk, hits something in the road and drives away; we are left to assume that she has killed a child. Ashok's family puts pressure on Balram to confess that he had been driving alone. Ashok becomes increasingly involved in bribing government officials for the benefit of the family coal business. Balram then decides that killing Ashok will be the only way to escape India's Rooster Coop. After bludgeoning Ashok with a bottle and stealing a large bribe, Balram moves to Bangalore, where he bribes the police in order to help start his own taxi business. Ashok too is portrayed to be trapped in the metaphorical Rooster Coop: his family controls what he does and society dictates how he acts. Just like Ashok, Balram pays off a family whose son one of his taxi drivers hit and killed. Balram explains that his own family was almost certainly killed by Ashok's relatives as retribution for his murder. At the end of the novel, Balram rationalizes his actions and considers that his freedom is worth the lives of his family and of Ashok. And thus ends the letter to Jiabao, letting the reader think of the dark humour of the tale, as well as the idea of life as a trap introduced by the writer.(wiki)",The White Tiger,Aravind Adiga, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789352645060,"Reprinted,2017",324,India,English

Pointing to the horizon where the sea and sky are joined, he says, ‘It is only an illusion because they can’t really meet, but isn’t it beautiful, this union which isn’t really there.’ – SAADAT HASAN MANTO Sometime in 2016, a series of dialogues took place which set out to find a meeting ground, even if only an illusion, between A.S. Dulat and Asad Durrani. One was a former chief of RAW, India’s external intelligence agency, the other of ISI, its Pakistani counterpart. As they could not meet in their home countries, the conversations, guided by journalist Aditya Sinha, took place in cities like Istanbul, Bangkok and Kathmandu. On the table were subjects that have long haunted South Asia, flashpoints that take lives regularly. It was in all ways a deep dive into the politics of the subcontinent, as seen through the eyes of two spymasters. Among the subjects: Kashmir, and a missed opportunity for peace; Hafiz Saeed and 26/11; Kulbhushan Jadhav; surgical strikes; the deal for Osama bin Laden; how the US and Russia feature in the India-Pakistan relationship; and how terror undermines the two countries’ attempts at talks. When the project was first mooted, General Durrani laughed and said nobody would believe it even if it was written as fiction. At a time of fraught relations, this unlikely dialogue between two former spy chiefs from opposite sides-a project that is the first of its kind-may well provide some answers.

How is it, then, that today the former British colonial trading post is a thriving Asian metropolis with not only the world's number one airline, best airport, and busiest port of trade, but also the world's fourth–highest per capita real income?

The story of that transformation is told here by Singapore's charismatic, controversial founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. Rising from a legacy of divisive colonialism, the devastation of the Second World War, and general poverty and disorder following the withdrawal of foreign forces, Singapore now is hailed as a city of the future. This miraculous history is dramatically recounted by the man who not only lived through it all but who fearlessly forged ahead and brought about most of these changes.

Delving deep into his own meticulous notes, as well as previously unpublished government papers and official records, Lee details the extraordinary efforts it took for an island city–state in Southeast Asia to survive at that time.

Lee explains how he and his cabinet colleagues finished off the communist threat to the fledgling state's security and began the arduous process of nation building: forging basic infrastructural roads through a land that still consisted primarily of swamps, creating an army from a hitherto racially and ideologically divided population, stamping out the last vestiges of colonial–era corruption, providing mass public housing, and establishing a national airline and airport.

In this illuminating account, Lee writes frankly about his trenchant approach to political opponents and his often unorthodox views on human rights, democracy, and inherited intelligence, aiming always ""to be correct, not politically correct."" Nothing in Singapore escaped his watchful eye: whether choosing shrubs for the greening of the country, restoring the romance of the historic Raffles Hotel, or openly, unabashedly persuading young men to marry women as well educated as themselves. Today's safe, tidy Singapore bears Lee's unmistakable stamp, for which he is unapologetic: ""If this is a nanny state, I am proud to have fostered one.""

Though Lee's domestic canvas in Singapore was small, his vigor and talent assured him a larger place in world affairs. With inimitable style, he brings history to life with cogent analyses of some of the greatest strategic issues of recent times and reveals how, over the years, he navigated the shifting tides of relations among America, China, and Taiwan, acting as confidant, sounding board, and messenger for them. He also includes candid, sometimes acerbic pen portraits of his political peers, including the indomitable Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, the poetry–spouting Jiang Zemin, and ideologues George Bush and Deng Xiaoping.

Lee also lifts the veil on his family life and writes tenderly of his wife and stalwart partner, Kwa Geok Choo, and of their pride in their three children –– particularly the eldest son, Hsien Loong, who is now Singapore's deputy prime minister.

For more than three decades, Lee Kuan Yew has been praised and vilified in equal measure, and he has established himself as a force impossible to ignore in Asian and international politics. From Third World to First offers readers a compelling glimpse into this visionary's heart, soul, and mind.",From Third World to First,Lee Kuan Yew, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780060197766,1st Edition,752,Abroad,English

Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain. 

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end. 
This novel has been greatly appreciated by its readers, being labeled as the most important book of the 20th century by the Children’s Books Of The Century poll, published in Books For Keeps. Although the exact number is not known, there have been 35-100 million copies of The Hobbit sold, till date, since it’s publishing in the year 1937. The Hobbit has also been adapted into a movie, whose first part, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey released in the United States on the 14th of December 2012. This movie was directed by Peter Jackson, and the second, and third parts are scheduled to release in 2013, and 2014.

A prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity set in the Sundarbans, an immense labyrinth of tiny islands on the easternmost coast of India.

The Hungry Tide is a very contemporary story of adventure and unlikely love, identity and history, set in one of the most fascinating regions on the earth. Off the easternmost coast of India, in the Bay of Bengal, lies the immense labyrinth of tiny islands known as the Sundarbans. 

For settlers here, life is extremely precarious. Attacks by deadly tigers are common. Unrest and eviction are constant threats. Without warning, at any time, tidal floods rise and surge over the land, leaving devastation in their wake. In this place of vengeful beauty, the lives of three people from different worlds collide. Piya Roy is a young marine biologist, of Indian descent but stubbornly American, in search of a rare, endangered river dolphin. 

Her journey begins with a disaster, when she is thrown from a boat into crocodile-infested waters. Rescue comes in the form of a young, illiterate fisherman, Fokir. Although they have no language between them, Piya and Fokir are powerfully drawn to each other, sharing an uncanny instinct for the ways of the sea. Piya engages Fokir to help with her research and finds a translator in Kanai Dutt, a businessman from Delhi whose idealistic aunt and uncle are longtime settlers in the Sundarbans. 

As the three of them launch into the elaborate backwaters, they are drawn unawares into the hidden undercurrents of this isolated world, where political turmoil exacts a personal toll that is every bit as powerful as the ravaging tide. Already an international success, The Hungry Tide is a prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity.",The Hungry Tide,Amitav Ghosh, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780007432974,"1st Edition,2004",403,Abroad,English

Sidney Sheldon’s Tell Me Your Dreams introduces three very different women at the onset of the novel. Introduced first is Ashley Peterson, a beautiful young woman who works for a computer company in Silicon Valley. Ashley is single and convinced she is being stalked. Readers next meet Ashley’s co-workers, Toni and Alette. Toni Prescott, a British woman in her early twenties is rather bold and striking. Rounding out the trio is Alette Peters, a quiet, dreamy romantic who moved to California from Rome. In the early stages of the novel, quite a few murders are committed and police in Chicago, San Francisco, and Quebec are desperate to solve the gruesome crimes that have taken place in each of their cities. Conclusive evidence points to one suspect and one suspect alone.

As the story develops, the reader learns why Ashley feels so alone in the world. She is the only child of a world-famous heart surgeon, who is often critical and overbearing. Although Ashley loves her father, she does not necessarily love his company and tries to avoid him. Toni is a provocateur with a penchant for song who suffered a strained relationship with her mother. Alette is a gifted artist who lacks self-confidence. As the novel draws to a conclusion, Ashley, Toni, and Alette are proven to be one in the same.

The reader will not be disappointed with Sheldon’s storytelling upon finishing this book. Sheldon provides a fascinating and precise examination of the different aspects of multiple personality disorder through the characters of Ashley, Toni, and Alette. He expertly draws the reader into his story, just as a fly is drawn into a spider’s web. Although this novel was a great effort, it is not one of Sheldon’s best—as portions of the plot are predictable. Sheldon’s ending, however, does have some panache.

The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was Christie’s sixth novel and was published in 1926. It was the third novel that featured the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Like many of her other novels, the book is set in a small town and focuses on the interactions between characters who are well known to one another.

When the novel was first published, critical reactions were mixed because of the unusual narrative structure. Christie chose to have the murderer tell the story from his point of view. This device caused some consternation because some believed that Christie was not “playing fair” with her readers. They reasoned that, in crime fiction, if the novel is to be fair, the reader should be able to follow the same path the detective does in order to solve the crime. Some believed that by having the narrator as the murderer, the reader would not be able to follow the path of the clues, since the murderer would, in order to protect his identity, conceal certain key pieces of information.

Christie circumvents this problem in several ways. First, Dr. Sheppard is an extremely believable character. Because of the remorseful tone he assumes at the beginning of the novel, the reader immediately trusts him and his observations. In addition, Poirot appears to trust Sheppard, including him in discussions with the police and, as Poirot admits, using Sheppard as a substitute for Captain Hastings, who had played Dr. Watson to Poirot’s Sherlock Holmes in previous novels. Thus, the reader is led to trust Sheppard because Poirot trusts him.

Sheppard also establishes an intimate rapport with the reader through the use of first-person narrative. The reader is privy to what are assumed to be the doctor’s private thoughts about Ackroyd’s murder. Poirot also confides in Sheppard and often asks his opinion of people within the town. Again, this action on the part of Christie serves to inspire confidence in the narrator; the reader does not suspect him because Poirot does not, and because Christie has, as in previous novels, established Poirot as a reliable source and a good judge of human nature.

Another aspect to the novel in regard to the narration is the comparatively small role that Poirot plays. The reader is accustomed to seeing him as the main character—almost as a master puppeteer who guides the movements of all around him. In fact, the readers expect Poirot to manipulate them, for this is the nature of crime fiction in general: The reader is manipulated by the detective to see things his or her way. Christie, however, chooses to radically depart from this formula. Instead of Poirot manipulating the reader, Sheppard manipulates both the reader and Poirot. The reader is unaware of this subterfuge, however, until the end of the novel, when all the other probable suspects have been eliminated and only Sheppard remains. The reader is then privy to Sheppard’s confession, and all the pieces to this very complex puzzle fall into place.

We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.

What’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.

Now, in Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom—and even of hope itself.

With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.",Everything Is F*cked: A Book About Hope,Mark Manson, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780062955951,"1st Published,2019",274,India,English

Hema Malini wears many hats with admirable ease. No other industry name comes close to matching the breadth of her achievements.
In an industry where the male star has traditionally driven the commercial success of films, Hema was an exception, with her name alone sufficing to ensure a film's, box-office glory. She was, arguably. India's first female superstar. Apart from starring in mainstream super-hits like Johny Mera Naam, Jugnu, Andaz, Seeta aur Geeta, Sholay and, more recently, Baghban, she received critical acclaim for her performances in Lal Patthar, Khushboo, Kinara, Meera, Ek Chadar Maili Si and Razia Sultan. But, even as she completes fifty years in cinema, there is much more to her than just her Bollywood journey.
From her efforts at reviving and sustaining classical dance to her graceful handling of her personal life and the controversies that have plagued her in her political avatar, from her relationships to her religious beliefs and her recent tryst with singing, Hema Malini: Beyond the Dream Girl covers it all.

Soon after arriving at his hotel in Istanbul, private investigator Hercule Poirot is instructed to return to London immediately. He boards the Orient Express that very night and is accosted by Mr. Ratchett, whom he had earlier seen in his hotel in Istanbul. He attempts to hire Poirot believing that his life is under threat, but the detective refuses him outright.

On the second night of the journey, a snowdrift brings the train to a halt. A cry from Ratchett’s coach pierces the eerie silence of the night. The next morning, M. Bouc, the director of the company that operates the train and an acquaintance of Poirot, informs him of the shocking murder of Ratchett. Upon his request, Poirot agrees to investigate the case. Soon Poirot learns of Ratchett’s questionable past and the probable reasons for his murder.

In the United States a few years earlier, Daisy Armstrong, a 3 year old heiress was kidnapped and killed by a man, who went by the name Cassetti, in spite of collecting a ransom from her wealthy family. Suspected to have rigged the trial, Cassetti fled the country after his acquittal. Poirot came to the conclusion that Ratchett was none other than Cassetti.

What connects the people in Ratchett’s coach who were travelling with him on that fateful night of the murder? Is one of the members of the Armstrong family the murderer?

Murder on the Orient Express has been adapted to TV, film and radio as well. The book was first published in 1934.

#1 New York Times Bestseller!

In the second book of the Carve the Mark duology, globally bestselling Divergent author Veronica Roth reveals how Cyra and Akos fulfill their fates. The Fates Divide is a richly imagined tale of hope and resilience told in four stunning perspectives.

The lives of Cyra Noavek and Akos Kereseth are ruled by their fates, spoken by the oracles at their births. The fates, once determined, are inescapable.

Akos is in love with Cyra, in spite of his fate: He will die in service to Cyra’s family. And when Cyra’s father, Lazmet Noavek—a soulless tyrant, thought to be dead—reclaims the Shotet throne, Akos believes his end is closer than ever.

As Lazmet ignites a barbaric war, Cyra and Akos are desperate to stop him at any cost. For Cyra, that could mean taking the life of the man who may—or may not—be her father. For Akos, it could mean giving his own. In a stunning twist, the two will discover how fate defines their lives in ways most unexpected.

The Fifth Mountain is set in the year 870 BC. Israel is being ruled by Phoenicians and Queen Jezebel wants to ensure that the people follow her own faith, one she brought from her native land. So, she orders the death of all those who do not bow down to her God, Baal.

One of these rebels is the Prophet Elijah. The Queen orders his death for refusing to obey her. Elijah flees to the lovely Phoenician city of Zarephath, which is also known by the Phoenician name of Akbar. This place was actually considered to be the abode of the God, though Elijah refused to acknowledge it.

There he meets a woman who is a worshipper of Baal. Though their religious views differ and she is older than him, Elijah and the woman are attracted to each other. But they don't discuss their feelings openly. Meanwhile, Elijah, who has been sent to this place by an angel, wants to rid Israel of the tyranny of Queen Jezebel.

But due to a surprising turn of events, the people of Akbar accept him as a sage. They consider him one of their own and come to him for advice and to settle disputes. As Elijah begins to bond with these people, he suffers from conflicting ambitions. He cannot decide whether to remain in Akbar, his adopted city, or to return to Israel. Subsequently, the destructive Assyrian invasion on Akbar worsens Elijah’s dilemma.
In The Fifth Mountain, through the context of a religious tale, the author conveys the importance of finding one's own destiny, even if it seems like it will involve rebelling against God's will. He insists that in doing so, one will find oneself getting closer to God.

Cards on the Table is a detective novel by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 2 November 1936 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence and the US edition at $2.00.

The book features the recurring characters of Hercule Poirot, Colonel Race, Superintendent Battle and the bumbling crime writer Ariadne Oliver, making her first appearance in a Poirot novel. The four detectives and four possible suspects play bridge after dinner with Mr Shaitana. At the end of the evening, Mr Shaitana is discovered murdered. Identifying the murderer, per Mrs Christie, depends wholly on discerning the psychology of the suspects.

This novel was well received at first printing and in later reviews. It was noted for its humour, for the subtlety of the writing, good clueing and tight writing, showing continuing improvement in the author's writing style in this, her twentieth novel. One later reviewer considered this in the top rung of her novels, and another found it to be most original, with a brilliant surprise ending.

In this compilation of eight marvellous short stories, Agatha Christie delights readers with the presence of her three male sleuths in six respective stories. Two stories each for Parker Pyne, the duo Harley Quin-Satterthwaite and Hercule Poirot ‘the police hound.’ In the two other, two women on a crossroads of their life are faced with difficult decision to make.

Presumably first appeared in the UK magazines, seven of them were written in the twenties and in the  thirties. Only The Harlequin Tea Set was in 1971. Interestingly, the copyright of five of them were signed as Mrs. Mallowan; hence after her divorce in 1928.

Poirot’s cases concern with a reconstruction of a suicide and the death of an old eccentric well-to-do man who summons the Belgian to his home. In the former story, it starts when he receives a telephone call from a mysterious woman begging for his help. ‘…table with yellow irises,’ she sounds frightened  of being overheard. In the latter, a shot is heard moments after the first gong for dinner but a guest firmly believes of having heard the second gong. Four years later the same plot appears in Dead Man’s Mirror (see Notes On The Murder In The Mews) with alterations to the character names.

In the non-detective stories, two female protagonists must make her choice. On the one hand, it is between a dog or starvation in Next To A Dog; the dog being the very memory of a dead husband. On the other, Theodora Darrel undergoes a battle of will between loyalty vs happiness. Will she still walk out from her marriage having known that her husband has been in a serious charge of theft and fraud?
The Love Detectives (1926) seems to mark the early appearance of Harley Quin; an enigmatic man of whom his path is crossed with Mr. Satterthwaite’s on a number of occasions (see Notes On The Mysterious Mr. Quin). In a dark night both meets when their car collide; Sattwerthwaite is with Colonel Melrose on their way to a crime scene. An aristocrat has been killed with a bronze figure of Venus. Then his beautiful wife and a male guest whom stays over in the house confess of the murder. Who is one to believe?

As the book begins, Athena is dead. How she ended up that way creates the intrigue sustaining the book. The child, Sherine Khalil renames herself Athena after her uncle was discussing with her mother on how her real name will betray her origins and something like Athena gave nothing away. As a child, she shows a strong religious vocation and reports seeing angels and saints, which both impresses and worries her parents.

She goes into a London University to pursue Engineering at the age of 19 but it's not what her heart wanted. One day she just decides that she wanted to drop out of college, get married and have a baby. Here, the author mentions that this might be due to the fact that she was abandoned herself and wants to give all that love she could to her child which she didn't receive from her birth mother. Two years later, her marriage falls apart because they are facing too many problems due to their young age and lack of money or mostly because he felt that she loved only the child and used him to get what she wanted. A very interesting quote she uses is ""From Ancient Greece on, the people who returned from battle were either dead on their shields or stronger, despite or because of their scars. It's better that way: I've lived on a battlefield since I was born, but I'm still alive and I don't need anyone to protect me."" She grows into a woman in search of answers to many questions that arise within a person. She had a life which many felt was content because she had a child of her own, money, and friends; everything but her mind was at peace, so she searches for the answer to the classical question of ""Who am I?"" through many experiences.

While Ashoke Ganguli is studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the young wife is lost in the alien land with not many around to help her and no friends she could talk to and hang out with. Now, their young boy has to be named by an elder person in the family, as a part of the tradition followed in Bengali families. This honour has been given to Ashima’s grandmother. Due to circumstances, the couple find out that they cannot leave the hospital without naming the child. Ashoke thus chooses the name of his favourite Russian author, Gogol, for time being. But when Ashima’s grandmother passes away before picking a name for her great grandson, the boy remains Gogol. Although he likes his name initially, he starts to dislike it by the time he begins going to high school. And he formally changes his name to Nikhil before leaving for higher studies, and becomes Nikhil Gogol Ganguli. Ashima is extremely unhappy with her son when he starts becoming more of an American, and Ashoke remains quiet about all this until he finds the right time to tell Gogol why he chose that name. The reason behind a name is what constitutes the soul of the story, which changes the young man forever.

Maurice Willson Disher's review in The Times Literary Supplement of 16 January 1943 concluded, ""No crime enthusiast will object that the story of how the painter died has to be told many times, for this, even if it creates an interest which is more problem than plot, demonstrates the author's uncanny skill. The answer to the riddle is brilliant.""

Maurice Richardson was pleased to see the return of Poirot to Christie's works when he reviewed the novel in the 10 January 1943 issue of The Observer. He concluded, ""Despite only five suspects, Mrs. Christie, as usual, puts a ring through the reader's nose and leads him to one of her smashing last-minute showdowns. This is well up to the standard of her middle Poirot period. No more need be said.""

J.D. Beresford in The Guardian's 20 January 1943 review, wrote: ""Miss Agatha Christie never fails us, and her Five Little Pigs presents a very pretty problem for the ingenious reader."" It concluded that the clue to who committed the crime was, ""completely satisfying.""

Robert Barnard: ""The-murder-in-the-past plot on its first and best appearance – accept no later substitutes. Presentation more intricate than usual, characterization more subtle."" All in all, it is a beautifully tailored book, rich and satisfying. The present writer would be willing to chance his arm and say that this is the best Christie of all.""

																																										Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain.

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end.

A novel rich in metaphors and symbolism, The Alchemist is a story based on the adventures of a young shepherd boy, who, upon deciding to follow his prophetic dreams, sets on a treasure hunt. This journey introduces him to some remarkable people who leave an indelible and profound mark on him.  

Summary Of The Book: 
The Alchemist was first published in 1988. The protagonist of the story, a young Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago, is plagued with recurring dreams, wherein a mysterious child urges him to look for buried treasure at the base of the Egyptian pyramids. Determined, he leaves Spain and heads towards Egypt. En route, he meets the King of Salem, a man named Melchizedek. Melchizedek introduces Santiago to the concept of a ‘Personal Legend’ or a personal map or a quest that guides him to what his heart truly desires.
While attempting to cross the Sahara desert on the way to Egypt, he joins a caravan which is driven by an Englishman who is aspiring to be an alchemist. During a stop over in Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets Fatima, a young girl of exceeding beauty who steals his heart. He asks her to marry him, but she declines saying that she will do so only once he has found the treasure he seeks. In the Saharan oasis of Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets a 200 year old alchemist who decides to accompany him on his expedition. He imparts wisdom and valuable knowledge to Santiago, who eventually understands why the supposed treasure keeps evading him.
Having sold over 65 million copies worldwide, The Alchemist is marked by its profound simplicity, the easy flow of the story, and the poignant moral it tries to teach the reader, that worldly possessions and extravagance are immaterial when compared to finding your own ‘Personal Legend’.",The Alchemist (About 150 Million Copies Sold),Paulo Coelho, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9788172234980,"1st Edition,2015",192,Abroad,English

Currently ranked World No. 1 in women's doubles, Sania Mirza became an instant sensation when she won the Wimbledon Championships girls' doubles title at the age of sixteen. From 2003 until her retirement from the singles circuit in 2012, she was ranked by the Women's Tennis Association as India's top player, both in singles and doubles. A six-time Grand Slam champion, she notched up an incredible forty-one consecutive wins with her doubles partner, Martina Hingis, between August 2015 and February 2016.

Ace against Odds is the story of this most iconic Indian player who beat incredible odds to get to the top of her sport. Sania writes with candour of the hardships along the way, of the physical and emotional trauma caused by injuries and medical procedures, of the friends and partners who became her mainstay along with her family, of the pressures of constant public scrutiny and, not least, the politics and heartbreaks that inevitably accompany success.

Sania broke the rules, she spoke her mind, she pushed herself to the limit, she played for India fiercely and without care for how it might impact her rankings - she is and will continue to remain an inspiration long after she steps off the tennis courts.(goodreads.com)",Ace Against Odds,Sania Mirza, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789351362630,"1st Edition,2016",288,India,English

Looking For Alaska, John Green’s debut novel was first published in 2005. Looking For Alaska follows the life of Miles Halter, as he leaves Florida to join boarding school in Alabama. He joins Culver Creek, the boarding school, later than usual, as he himself mentions that he is looking for a “Great Perhaps”.

Among his quirks include memorizing the last words of famous people and the “Great Perhaps” was that of Francois Rabelais. Miles receives the nickname Pudge in school, and though his was a figure that was nothing like the name entailed, it stuck.

His roommate and friend is Chip, who is the person who introduces him to Alaska Young, the Alaska mentioned in the title of the story. The adventures that they are involved in together cause him to fall in love with Alaska, and the entire book is written in first person. Most of the book is written as a countdown to a specific occurrence, which occurs in the rest of the book and it is easy to gather from the title, what this section would cover.

Though mostly mature and insightful, readers often get a peek into the sex addled mind of a sixteen year old school student, one who is forever counting the number of layers of clothing separating him from the bare body of the girl he is presently with.

Looking For Alaska won the 2006 Michael L. Printz Award from the American Library Association. It broke into the New York Times Bestseller list at number 10 in 2012, much after its debut in 2005. The film rights to the book have been sold to Paramount Pictures, though the project hasn’t been greenlighted yet due to lack of sufficient interest.

Hercule Poirot finds himself the uninvited guest at the scene of an elaborately planned murder on wheels. The Belgian detective is making his way from Istanbul, Turkey, to London, and he is looking forward to a leisurely trip and a chance to clear his head, a chance to rest his “little grey cells,” as Poirot refers to his brain.

A good friend of Poirot, M. Bouc, is an administrator with Wagon Lit, the train company that operates the Orient Express. Poirot prefers to travel first class. Because it is winter, off season for tourists, the detective is assured by Bouc that finding a first-class cabin on the train will be easy. To their surprise, the car leaving Istanbul, the Calais Coach, is nearly full. There is, however, one no-show, and Poirot finds himself sharing a compartment with Hector MacQueen, the private secretary to a wealthy American, Mr. Ratchett.

Poirot is introduced by Bouc to Dr. Constantine, a Greek physician, traveling in the next car. On the first night of the journey, as they sit in the dining car, Bouc points out to Poirot the variety of travelers in the dining car: the rich and the poor. Some are English, some American, some French, some Italian, some Russian, some Hungarian—an array of passengers from differing socioeconomic backgrounds and different cultures. Where else in the world, Bouc wonders aloud, could one find such an assortment of people beneath one roof? Yes, Poirot thinks to himself, perhaps only in America.

The first night passes peacefully, and Bouc moves Poirot from his shared cabin with MacQueen to a private one next door to Ratchett. During the second night of the trip, Poirot has trouble sleeping, awakened by voices, service bells summoning conductor Pierre Michel, and thumping on his cabin door. At about 1:15 a.m., Poirot sticks his head out of his cabin and sees a woman wearing a kimono with a dragon print walking down the corridor. He hears his neighbor, Ratchett, tell the conductor in perfect French that nothing is wrong and that he had not meant to ring his service bell. The train is stopped, too, as an avalanche of snow covers the tracks.

Ratchett, Poirot has determined, is an evil man. The evil shows on his face, and Poirot has taken an instant dislike in him. Earlier in the evening, Poirot had been approached by Ratchett and was offered a job—to keep Ratchett alive. Ratchett has been receiving hate mail and otherwise threatening letters.

This book, Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges, takes up the story from when A.P.J Abdul Kalam became the President of India. It covers his acceptance of the post of the President of India, his term in office, his efforts to make his term meaningful, and the challenges he faced.

His term from 2002 to 2007 was an eventful one. The President of India is just a titular head with minimal powers. But, the office is one of great influence and Kalam used it to best effect. He got the government and the public to focus on issues that were relevant to the country's all round growth.

He initiated programs like PURA to try and integrate rural areas into the general economic and technological growth of the country. He dreamt of taking the whole of India on his vision for the country in the new millennium, and he saw no reason why the villages should be left out in this vision.

Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges is more about Kalam’s vision for his country rather than about himself. He tries to provide a blueprint for development, and for reforms in the government and judiciary.

Dr.Kalam is a strong advocate for the use of technology and a proponent of e-governance. Even the little bits of personal experience during his term that he gives, he links with these ideas. For instance, he mentions the controversial dissolution of the Bihar assembly for which he later offered to resign. But, he does not focus on the political or personal implications of this decision, instead, he chose to highlight his use of electronic communication in lending his approval to this move, for he was in Moscow at that time.

He made the office of the President accessible to the public. He used his popularity and high visibility to inspire the youth of the country and convince them to believe in his 2020 vision for India. He urged the young people to dream big, and to believe in their country's destiny. Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges describes the term in office of one of the most charismatic Presidents of the country.

Winning, published in 2010, is a self-help management guide to help readers find answers to some of the most difficult questions of their professional lives. Winning starts off with an introduction, where Jack Welch says that the most commonly asked question is, What does it take to win?

The first part of the book, Underneath It All, describes Jack’s management philosophy. The author says that an organization should take ideas from every level, and not just the top leaders.

Winning also says that maintaining a good work-life balance is essential. The last part, Tying Up Loose Ends, answers nine questions that do not fall in the above categories, like managing the China threat.

Winning is filled with personal stories and experiences, and has been written with a no-nonsense attitude. This book offers no easy solutions on how to win, as there really are none.

Balram Halwai narrates his life in a letter, written in seven consecutive nights and addressed to the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao. In his letter, Balram explains how he, the son of a puller, escaped a life of servitude to become a successful businessman, describing himself as an entrepreneur.

Balram was born in the rural village of Laxmangarh, where he lived with his grandmother, parents, brother and extended family. He is a smart child but is forced to leave school in order to help pay for his cousin's dowry and begins to work in a teashop with his brother in Dhanbad. While working there he begins to learn about India's government and economy from the customers' conversations. Balram describes himself as a bad servant but a good listener and decides to become a driver.

After learning how to drive, Balram finds a job driving Ashok, the son of one of Laxmangarh's landlords. He takes over the job of the main driver, from a small car to a heavy-luxury described Honda City. He stops sending money back to his family and disrespects his grandmother during a trip back to his village. Balram moves to New Delhi with Ashok and his wife Pinky Madam. Throughout their time in Delhi, Balram is exposed to extensive corruption, especially in the government. In Delhi, the contrast between the poor and the wealthy is made even more evident by their proximity to one another.

One night Pinky Madam takes the wheel from Balram, while drunk, hits something in the road and drives away; we are left to assume that she has killed a child. Ashok's family puts pressure on Balram to confess that he had been driving alone. Ashok becomes increasingly involved in bribing government officials for the benefit of the family coal business. Balram then decides that killing Ashok will be the only way to escape India's Rooster Coop. After bludgeoning Ashok with a bottle and stealing a large bribe, Balram moves to Bangalore, where he bribes the police in order to help start his own taxi business. Ashok too is portrayed to be trapped in the metaphorical Rooster Coop: his family controls what he does and society dictates how he acts. Just like Ashok, Balram pays off a family whose son one of his taxi drivers hit and killed. Balram explains that his own family was almost certainly killed by Ashok's relatives as retribution for his murder. At the end of the novel, Balram rationalizes his actions and considers that his freedom is worth the lives of his family and of Ashok. And thus ends the letter to Jiabao, letting the reader think of the dark humour of the tale, as well as the idea of life as a trap introduced by the writer.(wiki)",The White Tiger,Aravind Adiga, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789352645060,"Reprinted,2017",324,India,English

Pointing to the horizon where the sea and sky are joined, he says, ‘It is only an illusion because they can’t really meet, but isn’t it beautiful, this union which isn’t really there.’ – SAADAT HASAN MANTO Sometime in 2016, a series of dialogues took place which set out to find a meeting ground, even if only an illusion, between A.S. Dulat and Asad Durrani. One was a former chief of RAW, India’s external intelligence agency, the other of ISI, its Pakistani counterpart. As they could not meet in their home countries, the conversations, guided by journalist Aditya Sinha, took place in cities like Istanbul, Bangkok and Kathmandu. On the table were subjects that have long haunted South Asia, flashpoints that take lives regularly. It was in all ways a deep dive into the politics of the subcontinent, as seen through the eyes of two spymasters. Among the subjects: Kashmir, and a missed opportunity for peace; Hafiz Saeed and 26/11; Kulbhushan Jadhav; surgical strikes; the deal for Osama bin Laden; how the US and Russia feature in the India-Pakistan relationship; and how terror undermines the two countries’ attempts at talks. When the project was first mooted, General Durrani laughed and said nobody would believe it even if it was written as fiction. At a time of fraught relations, this unlikely dialogue between two former spy chiefs from opposite sides-a project that is the first of its kind-may well provide some answers.

How is it, then, that today the former British colonial trading post is a thriving Asian metropolis with not only the world's number one airline, best airport, and busiest port of trade, but also the world's fourth–highest per capita real income?

The story of that transformation is told here by Singapore's charismatic, controversial founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. Rising from a legacy of divisive colonialism, the devastation of the Second World War, and general poverty and disorder following the withdrawal of foreign forces, Singapore now is hailed as a city of the future. This miraculous history is dramatically recounted by the man who not only lived through it all but who fearlessly forged ahead and brought about most of these changes.

Delving deep into his own meticulous notes, as well as previously unpublished government papers and official records, Lee details the extraordinary efforts it took for an island city–state in Southeast Asia to survive at that time.

Lee explains how he and his cabinet colleagues finished off the communist threat to the fledgling state's security and began the arduous process of nation building: forging basic infrastructural roads through a land that still consisted primarily of swamps, creating an army from a hitherto racially and ideologically divided population, stamping out the last vestiges of colonial–era corruption, providing mass public housing, and establishing a national airline and airport.

In this illuminating account, Lee writes frankly about his trenchant approach to political opponents and his often unorthodox views on human rights, democracy, and inherited intelligence, aiming always ""to be correct, not politically correct."" Nothing in Singapore escaped his watchful eye: whether choosing shrubs for the greening of the country, restoring the romance of the historic Raffles Hotel, or openly, unabashedly persuading young men to marry women as well educated as themselves. Today's safe, tidy Singapore bears Lee's unmistakable stamp, for which he is unapologetic: ""If this is a nanny state, I am proud to have fostered one.""

Though Lee's domestic canvas in Singapore was small, his vigor and talent assured him a larger place in world affairs. With inimitable style, he brings history to life with cogent analyses of some of the greatest strategic issues of recent times and reveals how, over the years, he navigated the shifting tides of relations among America, China, and Taiwan, acting as confidant, sounding board, and messenger for them. He also includes candid, sometimes acerbic pen portraits of his political peers, including the indomitable Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, the poetry–spouting Jiang Zemin, and ideologues George Bush and Deng Xiaoping.

Lee also lifts the veil on his family life and writes tenderly of his wife and stalwart partner, Kwa Geok Choo, and of their pride in their three children –– particularly the eldest son, Hsien Loong, who is now Singapore's deputy prime minister.

For more than three decades, Lee Kuan Yew has been praised and vilified in equal measure, and he has established himself as a force impossible to ignore in Asian and international politics. From Third World to First offers readers a compelling glimpse into this visionary's heart, soul, and mind.",From Third World to First,Lee Kuan Yew, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780060197766,1st Edition,752,Abroad,English

Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain. 

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end. 
This novel has been greatly appreciated by its readers, being labeled as the most important book of the 20th century by the Children’s Books Of The Century poll, published in Books For Keeps. Although the exact number is not known, there have been 35-100 million copies of The Hobbit sold, till date, since it’s publishing in the year 1937. The Hobbit has also been adapted into a movie, whose first part, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey released in the United States on the 14th of December 2012. This movie was directed by Peter Jackson, and the second, and third parts are scheduled to release in 2013, and 2014.

A prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity set in the Sundarbans, an immense labyrinth of tiny islands on the easternmost coast of India.

The Hungry Tide is a very contemporary story of adventure and unlikely love, identity and history, set in one of the most fascinating regions on the earth. Off the easternmost coast of India, in the Bay of Bengal, lies the immense labyrinth of tiny islands known as the Sundarbans. 

For settlers here, life is extremely precarious. Attacks by deadly tigers are common. Unrest and eviction are constant threats. Without warning, at any time, tidal floods rise and surge over the land, leaving devastation in their wake. In this place of vengeful beauty, the lives of three people from different worlds collide. Piya Roy is a young marine biologist, of Indian descent but stubbornly American, in search of a rare, endangered river dolphin. 

Her journey begins with a disaster, when she is thrown from a boat into crocodile-infested waters. Rescue comes in the form of a young, illiterate fisherman, Fokir. Although they have no language between them, Piya and Fokir are powerfully drawn to each other, sharing an uncanny instinct for the ways of the sea. Piya engages Fokir to help with her research and finds a translator in Kanai Dutt, a businessman from Delhi whose idealistic aunt and uncle are longtime settlers in the Sundarbans. 

As the three of them launch into the elaborate backwaters, they are drawn unawares into the hidden undercurrents of this isolated world, where political turmoil exacts a personal toll that is every bit as powerful as the ravaging tide. Already an international success, The Hungry Tide is a prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity.",The Hungry Tide,Amitav Ghosh, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780007432974,"1st Edition,2004",403,Abroad,English

Sidney Sheldon’s Tell Me Your Dreams introduces three very different women at the onset of the novel. Introduced first is Ashley Peterson, a beautiful young woman who works for a computer company in Silicon Valley. Ashley is single and convinced she is being stalked. Readers next meet Ashley’s co-workers, Toni and Alette. Toni Prescott, a British woman in her early twenties is rather bold and striking. Rounding out the trio is Alette Peters, a quiet, dreamy romantic who moved to California from Rome. In the early stages of the novel, quite a few murders are committed and police in Chicago, San Francisco, and Quebec are desperate to solve the gruesome crimes that have taken place in each of their cities. Conclusive evidence points to one suspect and one suspect alone.

As the story develops, the reader learns why Ashley feels so alone in the world. She is the only child of a world-famous heart surgeon, who is often critical and overbearing. Although Ashley loves her father, she does not necessarily love his company and tries to avoid him. Toni is a provocateur with a penchant for song who suffered a strained relationship with her mother. Alette is a gifted artist who lacks self-confidence. As the novel draws to a conclusion, Ashley, Toni, and Alette are proven to be one in the same.

The reader will not be disappointed with Sheldon’s storytelling upon finishing this book. Sheldon provides a fascinating and precise examination of the different aspects of multiple personality disorder through the characters of Ashley, Toni, and Alette. He expertly draws the reader into his story, just as a fly is drawn into a spider’s web. Although this novel was a great effort, it is not one of Sheldon’s best—as portions of the plot are predictable. Sheldon’s ending, however, does have some panache.

The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd,আগাথা ক্রিস্টি,"",TK. 538,https://rokomari.com//book/129560/the-murder-of-roger-ackroyd,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/5db93ac69_129560.jpg,"'The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd' Summary of the book
The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was Christie’s sixth novel and was published in 1926. It was the third novel that featured the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Like many of her other novels, the book is set in a small town and focuses on the interactions between characters who are well known to one another.

When the novel was first published, critical reactions were mixed because of the unusual narrative structure. Christie chose to have the murderer tell the story from his point of view. This device caused some consternation because some believed that Christie was not “playing fair” with her readers. They reasoned that, in crime fiction, if the novel is to be fair, the reader should be able to follow the same path the detective does in order to solve the crime. Some believed that by having the narrator as the murderer, the reader would not be able to follow the path of the clues, since the murderer would, in order to protect his identity, conceal certain key pieces of information.

Christie circumvents this problem in several ways. First, Dr. Sheppard is an extremely believable character. Because of the remorseful tone he assumes at the beginning of the novel, the reader immediately trusts him and his observations. In addition, Poirot appears to trust Sheppard, including him in discussions with the police and, as Poirot admits, using Sheppard as a substitute for Captain Hastings, who had played Dr. Watson to Poirot’s Sherlock Holmes in previous novels. Thus, the reader is led to trust Sheppard because Poirot trusts him.

Sheppard also establishes an intimate rapport with the reader through the use of first-person narrative. The reader is privy to what are assumed to be the doctor’s private thoughts about Ackroyd’s murder. Poirot also confides in Sheppard and often asks his opinion of people within the town. Again, this action on the part of Christie serves to inspire confidence in the narrator; the reader does not suspect him because Poirot does not, and because Christie has, as in previous novels, established Poirot as a reliable source and a good judge of human nature.

Another aspect to the novel in regard to the narration is the comparatively small role that Poirot plays. The reader is accustomed to seeing him as the main character—almost as a master puppeteer who guides the movements of all around him. In fact, the readers expect Poirot to manipulate them, for this is the nature of crime fiction in general: The reader is manipulated by the detective to see things his or her way. Christie, however, chooses to radically depart from this formula. Instead of Poirot manipulating the reader, Sheppard manipulates both the reader and Poirot. The reader is unaware of this subterfuge, however, until the end of the novel, when all the other probable suspects have been eliminated and only Sheppard remains. The reader is then privy to Sheppard’s confession, and all the pieces to this very complex puzzle fall into place.

We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.

What’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.

Now, in Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom—and even of hope itself.

With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.",Everything Is F*cked: A Book About Hope,Mark Manson, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780062955951,"1st Published,2019",274,India,English

Soon after arriving at his hotel in Istanbul, private investigator Hercule Poirot is instructed to return to London immediately. He boards the Orient Express that very night and is accosted by Mr. Ratchett, whom he had earlier seen in his hotel in Istanbul. He attempts to hire Poirot believing that his life is under threat, but the detective refuses him outright.

On the second night of the journey, a snowdrift brings the train to a halt. A cry from Ratchett’s coach pierces the eerie silence of the night. The next morning, M. Bouc, the director of the company that operates the train and an acquaintance of Poirot, informs him of the shocking murder of Ratchett. Upon his request, Poirot agrees to investigate the case. Soon Poirot learns of Ratchett’s questionable past and the probable reasons for his murder.

In the United States a few years earlier, Daisy Armstrong, a 3 year old heiress was kidnapped and killed by a man, who went by the name Cassetti, in spite of collecting a ransom from her wealthy family. Suspected to have rigged the trial, Cassetti fled the country after his acquittal. Poirot came to the conclusion that Ratchett was none other than Cassetti.

What connects the people in Ratchett’s coach who were travelling with him on that fateful night of the murder? Is one of the members of the Armstrong family the murderer?

Murder on the Orient Express has been adapted to TV, film and radio as well. The book was first published in 1934.

About Agatha Christie

Agatha Christie was a crime novelist and short story writer, who also wrote plays.

Among the many novels that she has written are best-sellers like Hickory Dickory Dock, Cat Among The Pigeons, By The Pricking Of My Thumbs, Curtain, Sleeping Murder, While the Light Lasts and Other Stories, Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories, and The Regatta Mystery and Other Stories.

Agatha Christie is considered to be the best writer of crime fiction and murder mysteries till date. Her writing reflects strongly of her love of the mysterious and mystical with ceremonies and religious sects playing a large role in the settings of her plots. She has also been inspired to a great extent by the time she spent in archaeological field seasons in the Middle East as a result of which some of her writing includes extreme details of temples and excavation sites.

Agatha Christie was born on 15 September, 1890, to a wealthy family in Torquay, Devon. Prior to marrying and starting a family in London, she served in a hospital at the time of the World War I. She is listed on the Guinness Book of World Records as the best-selling novelist of all time. The publication of her first novel in 1920 featuring her most famous character Hercule Poirot kick started her writing career.

#1 New York Times Bestseller!

In the second book of the Carve the Mark duology, globally bestselling Divergent author Veronica Roth reveals how Cyra and Akos fulfill their fates. The Fates Divide is a richly imagined tale of hope and resilience told in four stunning perspectives.

The lives of Cyra Noavek and Akos Kereseth are ruled by their fates, spoken by the oracles at their births. The fates, once determined, are inescapable.

Akos is in love with Cyra, in spite of his fate: He will die in service to Cyra’s family. And when Cyra’s father, Lazmet Noavek—a soulless tyrant, thought to be dead—reclaims the Shotet throne, Akos believes his end is closer than ever.

As Lazmet ignites a barbaric war, Cyra and Akos are desperate to stop him at any cost. For Cyra, that could mean taking the life of the man who may—or may not—be her father. For Akos, it could mean giving his own. In a stunning twist, the two will discover how fate defines their lives in ways most unexpected.

The Fifth Mountain is set in the year 870 BC. Israel is being ruled by Phoenicians and Queen Jezebel wants to ensure that the people follow her own faith, one she brought from her native land. So, she orders the death of all those who do not bow down to her God, Baal.

One of these rebels is the Prophet Elijah. The Queen orders his death for refusing to obey her. Elijah flees to the lovely Phoenician city of Zarephath, which is also known by the Phoenician name of Akbar. This place was actually considered to be the abode of the God, though Elijah refused to acknowledge it.

There he meets a woman who is a worshipper of Baal. Though their religious views differ and she is older than him, Elijah and the woman are attracted to each other. But they don't discuss their feelings openly. Meanwhile, Elijah, who has been sent to this place by an angel, wants to rid Israel of the tyranny of Queen Jezebel.

But due to a surprising turn of events, the people of Akbar accept him as a sage. They consider him one of their own and come to him for advice and to settle disputes. As Elijah begins to bond with these people, he suffers from conflicting ambitions. He cannot decide whether to remain in Akbar, his adopted city, or to return to Israel. Subsequently, the destructive Assyrian invasion on Akbar worsens Elijah’s dilemma.
In The Fifth Mountain, through the context of a religious tale, the author conveys the importance of finding one's own destiny, even if it seems like it will involve rebelling against God's will. He insists that in doing so, one will find oneself getting closer to God.

Cards on the Table is a detective novel by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 2 November 1936 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence and the US edition at $2.00.

The book features the recurring characters of Hercule Poirot, Colonel Race, Superintendent Battle and the bumbling crime writer Ariadne Oliver, making her first appearance in a Poirot novel. The four detectives and four possible suspects play bridge after dinner with Mr Shaitana. At the end of the evening, Mr Shaitana is discovered murdered. Identifying the murderer, per Mrs Christie, depends wholly on discerning the psychology of the suspects.

This novel was well received at first printing and in later reviews. It was noted for its humour, for the subtlety of the writing, good clueing and tight writing, showing continuing improvement in the author's writing style in this, her twentieth novel. One later reviewer considered this in the top rung of her novels, and another found it to be most original, with a brilliant surprise ending.

In this compilation of eight marvellous short stories, Agatha Christie delights readers with the presence of her three male sleuths in six respective stories. Two stories each for Parker Pyne, the duo Harley Quin-Satterthwaite and Hercule Poirot ‘the police hound.’ In the two other, two women on a crossroads of their life are faced with difficult decision to make.


The map of Majorca, Spain where Parker Pyne has to resolve a rift between two women while on holiday.

Presumably first appeared in the UK magazines, seven of them were written in the twenties and in the  thirties. Only The Harlequin Tea Set was in 1971. Interestingly, the copyright of five of them were signed as Mrs. Mallowan; hence after her divorce in 1928.

Poirot’s cases concern with a reconstruction of a suicide and the death of an old eccentric well-to-do man who summons the Belgian to his home. In the former story, it starts when he receives a telephone call from a mysterious woman begging for his help. ‘…table with yellow irises,’ she sounds frightened  of being overheard. In the latter, a shot is heard moments after the first gong for dinner but a guest firmly believes of having heard the second gong. Four years later the same plot appears in Dead Man’s Mirror (see Notes On The Murder In The Mews) with alterations to the character names.

In the non-detective stories, two female protagonists must make her choice. On the one hand, it is between a dog or starvation in Next To A Dog; the dog being the very memory of a dead husband. On the other, Theodora Darrel undergoes a battle of will between loyalty vs happiness. Will she still walk out from her marriage having known that her husband has been in a serious charge of theft and fraud?
The Love Detectives (1926) seems to mark the early appearance of Harley Quin; an enigmatic man of whom his path is crossed with Mr. Satterthwaite’s on a number of occasions (see Notes On The Mysterious Mr. Quin). In a dark night both meets when their car collide; Sattwerthwaite is with Colonel Melrose on their way to a crime scene. An aristocrat has been killed with a bronze figure of Venus. Then his beautiful wife and a male guest whom stays over in the house confess of the murder. Who is one to believe?

Any readers who remember Mrs. Protheroe and Lawrence Redding     will understand what  occurs next in the story (see Notes On The Murder At The Vicarage).  The clock is changed to suit the alibi of a suspect and the study also becomes where the ‘thing’ happens. In Miss Marple’s case, however, the deceased’s wife and her

As the book begins, Athena is dead. How she ended up that way creates the intrigue sustaining the book. The child, Sherine Khalil renames herself Athena after her uncle was discussing with her mother on how her real name will betray her origins and something like Athena gave nothing away. As a child, she shows a strong religious vocation and reports seeing angels and saints, which both impresses and worries her parents.

She goes into a London University to pursue Engineering at the age of 19 but it's not what her heart wanted. One day she just decides that she wanted to drop out of college, get married and have a baby. Here, the author mentions that this might be due to the fact that she was abandoned herself and wants to give all that love she could to her child which she didn't receive from her birth mother. Two years later, her marriage falls apart because they are facing too many problems due to their young age and lack of money or mostly because he felt that she loved only the child and used him to get what she wanted. A very interesting quote she uses is ""From Ancient Greece on, the people who returned from battle were either dead on their shields or stronger, despite or because of their scars. It's better that way: I've lived on a battlefield since I was born, but I'm still alive and I don't need anyone to protect me."" She grows into a woman in search of answers to many questions that arise within a person. She had a life which many felt was content because she had a child of her own, money, and friends; everything but her mind was at peace, so she searches for the answer to the classical question of ""Who am I?"" through many experiences.

Ashoke Ganguli and Ashima Ganguli, a couple away from their home in Bengal, are about to have their first child in Massachusetts. While Ashoke Ganguli is studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the young wife is lost in the alien land with not many around to help her and no friends she could talk to and hang out with. Now, their young boy has to be named by an elder person in the family, as a part of the tradition followed in Bengali families. This honour has been given to Ashima’s grandmother. Due to circumstances, the couple find out that they cannot leave the hospital without naming the child. Ashoke thus chooses the name of his favourite Russian author, Gogol, for time being. But when Ashima’s grandmother passes away before picking a name for her great grandson, the boy remains Gogol. Although he likes his name initially, he starts to dislike it by the time he begins going to high school. And he formally changes his name to Nikhil before leaving for higher studies, and becomes Nikhil Gogol Ganguli. Ashima is extremely unhappy with her son when he starts becoming more of an American, and Ashoke remains quiet about all this until he finds the right time to tell Gogol why he chose that name. The reason behind a name is what constitutes the soul of the story, which changes the young man forever. This timeless story will certainly leave in thoughts that overwhelm you each time you recall it.

The answer to the riddle is brilliant.""

Maurice Richardson was pleased to see the return of Poirot to Christie's works when he reviewed the novel in the 10 January 1943 issue of The Observer. He concluded, ""Despite only five suspects, Mrs. Christie, as usual, puts a ring through the reader's nose and leads him to one of her smashing last-minute showdowns. This is well up to the standard of her middle Poirot period. No more need be said.""

J.D. Beresford in The Guardian's 20 January 1943 review, wrote: ""Miss Agatha Christie never fails us, and her Five Little Pigs presents a very pretty problem for the ingenious reader."" It concluded that the clue to who committed the crime was, ""completely satisfying.""

Robert Barnard: ""The-murder-in-the-past plot on its first and best appearance – accept no later substitutes. Presentation more intricate than usual, characterization more subtle.""

																																										Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain.

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end.

This novel has been greatly appreciated by its readers, being labeled as the most important book of the 20th century by the Children’s Books Of The Century poll, published in Books For Keeps. Although the exact number is not known, there have been 35-100 million copies of The Hobbit sold, till date, since it’s publishing in the year 1937.

A novel rich in metaphors and symbolism, The Alchemist is a story based on the adventures of a young shepherd boy, who, upon deciding to follow his prophetic dreams, sets on a treasure hunt. This journey introduces him to some remarkable people who leave an indelible and profound mark on him.  

Summary Of The Book: 
The Alchemist was first published in 1988. The protagonist of the story, a young Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago, is plagued with recurring dreams, wherein a mysterious child urges him to look for buried treasure at the base of the Egyptian pyramids. Determined, he leaves Spain and heads towards Egypt. En route, he meets the King of Salem, a man named Melchizedek. Melchizedek introduces Santiago to the concept of a ‘Personal Legend’ or a personal map or a quest that guides him to what his heart truly desires.
While attempting to cross the Sahara desert on the way to Egypt, he joins a caravan which is driven by an Englishman who is aspiring to be an alchemist. During a stop over in Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets Fatima, a young girl of exceeding beauty who steals his heart. He asks her to marry him, but she declines saying that she will do so only once he has found the treasure he seeks. In the Saharan oasis of Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets a 200 year old alchemist who decides to accompany him on his expedition. He imparts wisdom and valuable knowledge to Santiago, who eventually understands why the supposed treasure keeps evading him.
Having sold over 65 million copies worldwide, The Alchemist is marked by its profound simplicity, the easy flow of the story, and the poignant moral it tries to teach the reader, that worldly possessions and extravagance are immaterial when compared to finding your own ‘Personal Legend’.",The Alchemist (About 150 Million Copies Sold),Paulo Coelho, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9788172234980,"1st Edition,2015",192,Abroad,English

She moves to Geneva, Switzerland, aspiring to live the life of her dreams - a life filled with fame and fortune. Her dreams are shattered when she is introduced to the harsh realities of life.

One day, a chance encounter with an Arab man earns her a thousand francs for one night. Lured by the prospect of easy money, she ends up becoming a prostitute in a brothel in Geneva’s red-light district. Once there, she quickly learns the ropes and becomes quite successful, not to mention the envy of her colleagues. She shuts the door on love and only has time for the demands made by her body.

Her life is thrown into disarray when she meets a young Swiss painter named Ralf. She falls in love with Ralf, who is completely different from her. Her carnal feelings for Ralf and her true love for him vie for supremacy. She finally decides to move away from Geneva because she sees no future for them. But just before she leaves, she discovers the beautiful blend of sex and true love with Ralf.

Currently ranked World No. 1 in women's doubles, Sania Mirza became an instant sensation when she won the Wimbledon Championships girls' doubles title at the age of sixteen. From 2003 until her retirement from the singles circuit in 2012, she was ranked by the Women's Tennis Association as India's top player, both in singles and doubles. A six-time Grand Slam champion, she notched up an incredible forty-one consecutive wins with her doubles partner, Martina Hingis, between August 2015 and February 2016.

Ace against Odds is the story of this most iconic Indian player who beat incredible odds to get to the top of her sport. Sania writes with candour of the hardships along the way, of the physical and emotional trauma caused by injuries and medical procedures, of the friends and partners who became her mainstay along with her family, of the pressures of constant public scrutiny and, not least, the politics and heartbreaks that inevitably accompany success.

Sania broke the rules, she spoke her mind, she pushed herself to the limit, she played for India fiercely and without care for how it might impact her rankings - she is and will continue to remain an inspiration long after she steps off the tennis courts.(goodreads.com)",Ace Against Odds,Sania Mirza, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789351362630,"1st Edition,2016",288,India,English

Looking For Alaska, John Green’s debut novel was first published in 2005. Looking For Alaska follows the life of Miles Halter, as he leaves Florida to join boarding school in Alabama. He joins Culver Creek, the boarding school, later than usual, as he himself mentions that he is looking for a “Great Perhaps”.

Among his quirks include memorizing the last words of famous people and the “Great Perhaps” was that of Francois Rabelais. Miles receives the nickname Pudge in school, and though his was a figure that was nothing like the name entailed, it stuck.

His roommate and friend is Chip, who is the person who introduces him to Alaska Young, the Alaska mentioned in the title of the story. The adventures that they are involved in together cause him to fall in love with Alaska, and the entire book is written in first person. Most of the book is written as a countdown to a specific occurrence, which occurs in the rest of the book and it is easy to gather from the title, what this section would cover.

Though mostly mature and insightful, readers often get a peek into the sex addled mind of a sixteen year old school student, one who is forever counting the number of layers of clothing separating him from the bare body of the girl he is presently with.

Looking For Alaska won the 2006 Michael L. Printz Award from the American Library Association. It broke into the New York Times Bestseller list at number 10 in 2012, much after its debut in 2005. The film rights to the book have been sold to Paramount Pictures, though the project hasn’t been greenlighted yet due to lack of sufficient interest.

Hercule Poirot finds himself the uninvited guest at the scene of an elaborately planned murder on wheels. The Belgian detective is making his way from Istanbul, Turkey, to London, and he is looking forward to a leisurely trip and a chance to clear his head, a chance to rest his “little grey cells,” as Poirot refers to his brain.

A good friend of Poirot, M. Bouc, is an administrator with Wagon Lit, the train company that operates the Orient Express. Poirot prefers to travel first class. Because it is winter, off season for tourists, the detective is assured by Bouc that finding a first-class cabin on the train will be easy. To their surprise, the car leaving Istanbul, the Calais Coach, is nearly full. There is, however, one no-show, and Poirot finds himself sharing a compartment with Hector MacQueen, the private secretary to a wealthy American, Mr. Ratchett.

Poirot is introduced by Bouc to Dr. Constantine, a Greek physician, traveling in the next car. On the first night of the journey, as they sit in the dining car, Bouc points out to Poirot the variety of travelers in the dining car: the rich and the poor. Some are English, some American, some French, some Italian, some Russian, some Hungarian—an array of passengers from differing socioeconomic backgrounds and different cultures. Where else in the world, Bouc wonders aloud, could one find such an assortment of people beneath one roof? Yes, Poirot thinks to himself, perhaps only in America.

The first night passes peacefully, and Bouc moves Poirot from his shared cabin with MacQueen to a private one next door to Ratchett. During the second night of the trip, Poirot has trouble sleeping, awakened by voices, service bells summoning conductor Pierre Michel, and thumping on his cabin door. At about 1:15 a.m., Poirot sticks his head out of his cabin and sees a woman wearing a kimono with a dragon print walking down the corridor. He hears his neighbor, Ratchett, tell the conductor in perfect French that nothing is wrong and that he had not meant to ring his service bell. The train is stopped, too, as an avalanche of snow covers the tracks.

Ratchett, Poirot has determined, is an evil man. The evil shows on his face, and Poirot has taken an instant dislike in him. Earlier in the evening, Poirot had been approached by Ratchett and was offered a job—to keep Ratchett alive. Ratchett has been receiving hate mail and otherwise threatening letters.

This book, Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges, takes up the story from when A.P.J Abdul Kalam became the President of India. It covers his acceptance of the post of the President of India, his term in office, his efforts to make his term meaningful, and the challenges he faced.

His term from 2002 to 2007 was an eventful one. The President of India is just a titular head with minimal powers. But, the office is one of great influence and Kalam used it to best effect. He got the government and the public to focus on issues that were relevant to the country's all round growth.

He initiated programs like PURA to try and integrate rural areas into the general economic and technological growth of the country. He dreamt of taking the whole of India on his vision for the country in the new millennium, and he saw no reason why the villages should be left out in this vision.

Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges is more about Kalam’s vision for his country rather than about himself. He tries to provide a blueprint for development, and for reforms in the government and judiciary.

Dr.Kalam is a strong advocate for the use of technology and a proponent of e-governance. Even the little bits of personal experience during his term that he gives, he links with these ideas. For instance, he mentions the controversial dissolution of the Bihar assembly for which he later offered to resign. But, he does not focus on the political or personal implications of this decision, instead, he chose to highlight his use of electronic communication in lending his approval to this move, for he was in Moscow at that time.

He made the office of the President accessible to the public. He used his popularity and high visibility to inspire the youth of the country and convince them to believe in his 2020 vision for India. He urged the young people to dream big, and to believe in their country's destiny. Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges describes the term in office of one of the most charismatic Presidents of the country.

Winning, published in 2010, is a self-help management guide to help readers find answers to some of the most difficult questions of their professional lives. Winning starts off with an introduction, where Jack Welch says that the most commonly asked question is, What does it take to win?

The first part of the book, Underneath It All, describes Jack’s management philosophy. The author says that an organization should take ideas from every level, and not just the top leaders.

In Your Career, the authors encourage readers to find the right job, to understand what it takes to get promoted, and learn how to handle a bad boss. Winning also says that maintaining a good work-life balance is essential. The last part, Tying Up Loose Ends, answers nine questions that do not fall in the above categories, like managing the China threat.

Winning is filled with personal stories and experiences, and has been written with a no-nonsense attitude. This book offers no easy solutions on how to win, as there really are none. This guide was on the top of The Wall Street Journal bestseller list, and has also been on The New York Times' bestseller list.

Balram Halwai narrates his life in a letter, written in seven consecutive nights and addressed to the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao. In his letter, Balram explains how he, the son of a puller, escaped a life of servitude to become a successful businessman, describing himself as an entrepreneur.

Balram was born in the rural village of Laxmangarh, where he lived with his grandmother, parents, brother and extended family. He is a smart child but is forced to leave school in order to help pay for his cousin's dowry and begins to work in a teashop with his brother in Dhanbad. While working there he begins to learn about India's government and economy from the customers' conversations. Balram describes himself as a bad servant but a good listener and decides to become a driver.

After learning how to drive, Balram finds a job driving Ashok, the son of one of Laxmangarh's landlords. He takes over the job of the main driver, from a small car to a heavy-luxury described Honda City. He stops sending money back to his family and disrespects his grandmother during a trip back to his village. Balram moves to New Delhi with Ashok and his wife Pinky Madam. Throughout their time in Delhi, Balram is exposed to extensive corruption, especially in the government. In Delhi, the contrast between the poor and the wealthy is made even more evident by their proximity to one another.

One night Pinky Madam takes the wheel from Balram, while drunk, hits something in the road and drives away; we are left to assume that she has killed a child. Ashok's family puts pressure on Balram to confess that he had been driving alone. Ashok becomes increasingly involved in bribing government officials for the benefit of the family coal business. Balram then decides that killing Ashok will be the only way to escape India's Rooster Coop. After bludgeoning Ashok with a bottle and stealing a large bribe, Balram moves to Bangalore, where he bribes the police in order to help start his own taxi business. Ashok too is portrayed to be trapped in the metaphorical Rooster Coop: his family controls what he does and society dictates how he acts. Just like Ashok, Balram pays off a family whose son one of his taxi drivers hit and killed. Balram explains that his own family was almost certainly killed by Ashok's relatives as retribution for his murder. At the end of the novel, Balram rationalizes his actions and considers that his freedom is worth the lives of his family and of Ashok. And thus ends the letter to Jiabao, letting the reader think of the dark humour of the tale, as well as the idea of life as a trap introduced by the writer.(wiki)",The White Tiger,Aravind Adiga, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789352645060,"Reprinted,2017",324,India,English

Pointing to the horizon where the sea and sky are joined, he says, ‘It is only an illusion because they can’t really meet, but isn’t it beautiful, this union which isn’t really there.’ – SAADAT HASAN MANTO Sometime in 2016, a series of dialogues took place which set out to find a meeting ground, even if only an illusion, between A.S. Dulat and Asad Durrani. One was a former chief of RAW, India’s external intelligence agency, the other of ISI, its Pakistani counterpart. As they could not meet in their home countries, the conversations, guided by journalist Aditya Sinha, took place in cities like Istanbul, Bangkok and Kathmandu. On the table were subjects that have long haunted South Asia, flashpoints that take lives regularly. It was in all ways a deep dive into the politics of the subcontinent, as seen through the eyes of two spymasters. Among the subjects: Kashmir, and a missed opportunity for peace; Hafiz Saeed and 26/11; Kulbhushan Jadhav; surgical strikes; the deal for Osama bin Laden; how the US and Russia feature in the India-Pakistan relationship; and how terror undermines the two countries’ attempts at talks. When the project was first mooted, General Durrani laughed and said nobody would believe it even if it was written as fiction. At a time of fraught relations, this unlikely dialogue between two former spy chiefs from opposite sides-a project that is the first of its kind-may well provide some answers.

How is it, then, that today the former British colonial trading post is a thriving Asian metropolis with not only the world's number one airline, best airport, and busiest port of trade, but also the world's fourth–highest per capita real income?

The story of that transformation is told here by Singapore's charismatic, controversial founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. Rising from a legacy of divisive colonialism, the devastation of the Second World War, and general poverty and disorder following the withdrawal of foreign forces, Singapore now is hailed as a city of the future. This miraculous history is dramatically recounted by the man who not only lived through it all but who fearlessly forged ahead and brought about most of these changes.

Delving deep into his own meticulous notes, as well as previously unpublished government papers and official records, Lee details the extraordinary efforts it took for an island city–state in Southeast Asia to survive at that time.

Lee explains how he and his cabinet colleagues finished off the communist threat to the fledgling state's security and began the arduous process of nation building: forging basic infrastructural roads through a land that still consisted primarily of swamps, creating an army from a hitherto racially and ideologically divided population, stamping out the last vestiges of colonial–era corruption, providing mass public housing, and establishing a national airline and airport.

In this illuminating account, Lee writes frankly about his trenchant approach to political opponents and his often unorthodox views on human rights, democracy, and inherited intelligence, aiming always ""to be correct, not politically correct."" Nothing in Singapore escaped his watchful eye: whether choosing shrubs for the greening of the country, restoring the romance of the historic Raffles Hotel, or openly, unabashedly persuading young men to marry women as well educated as themselves. Today's safe, tidy Singapore bears Lee's unmistakable stamp, for which he is unapologetic: ""If this is a nanny state, I am proud to have fostered one.""

Though Lee's domestic canvas in Singapore was small, his vigor and talent assured him a larger place in world affairs. With inimitable style, he brings history to life with cogent analyses of some of the greatest strategic issues of recent times and reveals how, over the years, he navigated the shifting tides of relations among America, China, and Taiwan, acting as confidant, sounding board, and messenger for them. He also includes candid, sometimes acerbic pen portraits of his political peers, including the indomitable Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, the poetry–spouting Jiang Zemin, and ideologues George Bush and Deng Xiaoping.

Lee also lifts the veil on his family life and writes tenderly of his wife and stalwart partner, Kwa Geok Choo, and of their pride in their three children –– particularly the eldest son, Hsien Loong, who is now Singapore's deputy prime minister.

For more than three decades, Lee Kuan Yew has been praised and vilified in equal measure, and he has established himself as a force impossible to ignore in Asian and international politics. From Third World to First offers readers a compelling glimpse into this visionary's heart, soul, and mind.",From Third World to First,Lee Kuan Yew, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780060197766,1st Edition,752,Abroad,English

Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain. 

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end. 
This novel has been greatly appreciated by its readers, being labeled as the most important book of the 20th century by the Children’s Books Of The Century poll, published in Books For Keeps. Although the exact number is not known, there have been 35-100 million copies of The Hobbit sold, till date, since it’s publishing in the year 1937. The Hobbit has also been adapted into a movie, whose first part, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey released in the United States on the 14th of December 2012. This movie was directed by Peter Jackson, and the second, and third parts are scheduled to release in 2013, and 2014.

A prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity set in the Sundarbans, an immense labyrinth of tiny islands on the easternmost coast of India.

The Hungry Tide is a very contemporary story of adventure and unlikely love, identity and history, set in one of the most fascinating regions on the earth. Off the easternmost coast of India, in the Bay of Bengal, lies the immense labyrinth of tiny islands known as the Sundarbans. 

For settlers here, life is extremely precarious. Attacks by deadly tigers are common. Unrest and eviction are constant threats. Without warning, at any time, tidal floods rise and surge over the land, leaving devastation in their wake. In this place of vengeful beauty, the lives of three people from different worlds collide. Piya Roy is a young marine biologist, of Indian descent but stubbornly American, in search of a rare, endangered river dolphin. 

Her journey begins with a disaster, when she is thrown from a boat into crocodile-infested waters. Rescue comes in the form of a young, illiterate fisherman, Fokir. Although they have no language between them, Piya and Fokir are powerfully drawn to each other, sharing an uncanny instinct for the ways of the sea. Piya engages Fokir to help with her research and finds a translator in Kanai Dutt, a businessman from Delhi whose idealistic aunt and uncle are longtime settlers in the Sundarbans. 

As the three of them launch into the elaborate backwaters, they are drawn unawares into the hidden undercurrents of this isolated world, where political turmoil exacts a personal toll that is every bit as powerful as the ravaging tide. Already an international success, The Hungry Tide is a prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity.",The Hungry Tide,Amitav Ghosh, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780007432974,"1st Edition,2004",403,Abroad,English

Sidney Sheldon’s Tell Me Your Dreams introduces three very different women at the onset of the novel. Introduced first is Ashley Peterson, a beautiful young woman who works for a computer company in Silicon Valley. Ashley is single and convinced she is being stalked. Readers next meet Ashley’s co-workers, Toni and Alette. Toni Prescott, a British woman in her early twenties is rather bold and striking. Rounding out the trio is Alette Peters, a quiet, dreamy romantic who moved to California from Rome. In the early stages of the novel, quite a few murders are committed and police in Chicago, San Francisco, and Quebec are desperate to solve the gruesome crimes that have taken place in each of their cities. Conclusive evidence points to one suspect and one suspect alone.

As the story develops, the reader learns why Ashley feels so alone in the world. She is the only child of a world-famous heart surgeon, who is often critical and overbearing. Although Ashley loves her father, she does not necessarily love his company and tries to avoid him. Toni is a provocateur with a penchant for song who suffered a strained relationship with her mother. Alette is a gifted artist who lacks self-confidence. As the novel draws to a conclusion, Ashley, Toni, and Alette are proven to be one in the same.

The reader will not be disappointed with Sheldon’s storytelling upon finishing this book. Sheldon provides a fascinating and precise examination of the different aspects of multiple personality disorder through the characters of Ashley, Toni, and Alette. He expertly draws the reader into his story, just as a fly is drawn into a spider’s web. Although this novel was a great effort, it is not one of Sheldon’s best—as portions of the plot are predictable. Sheldon’s ending, however, does have some panache.

The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd,আগাথা ক্রিস্টি,"",TK. 538,https://rokomari.com//book/129560/the-murder-of-roger-ackroyd,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/5db93ac69_129560.jpg,"'The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd' Summary of the book
The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was Christie’s sixth novel and was published in 1926. It was the third novel that featured the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Like many of her other novels, the book is set in a small town and focuses on the interactions between characters who are well known to one another.

When the novel was first published, critical reactions were mixed because of the unusual narrative structure. Christie chose to have the murderer tell the story from his point of view. This device caused some consternation because some believed that Christie was not “playing fair” with her readers. They reasoned that, in crime fiction, if the novel is to be fair, the reader should be able to follow the same path the detective does in order to solve the crime. Some believed that by having the narrator as the murderer, the reader would not be able to follow the path of the clues, since the murderer would, in order to protect his identity, conceal certain key pieces of information.

Christie circumvents this problem in several ways. First, Dr. Sheppard is an extremely believable character. Because of the remorseful tone he assumes at the beginning of the novel, the reader immediately trusts him and his observations. In addition, Poirot appears to trust Sheppard, including him in discussions with the police and, as Poirot admits, using Sheppard as a substitute for Captain Hastings, who had played Dr. Watson to Poirot’s Sherlock Holmes in previous novels. Thus, the reader is led to trust Sheppard because Poirot trusts him.

Sheppard also establishes an intimate rapport with the reader through the use of first-person narrative. The reader is privy to what are assumed to be the doctor’s private thoughts about Ackroyd’s murder. Poirot also confides in Sheppard and often asks his opinion of people within the town. Again, this action on the part of Christie serves to inspire confidence in the narrator; the reader does not suspect him because Poirot does not, and because Christie has, as in previous novels, established Poirot as a reliable source and a good judge of human nature.

Another aspect to the novel in regard to the narration is the comparatively small role that Poirot plays. The reader is accustomed to seeing him as the main character—almost as a master puppeteer who guides the movements of all around him. In fact, the readers expect Poirot to manipulate them, for this is the nature of crime fiction in general: The reader is manipulated by the detective to see things his or her way. Christie, however, chooses to radically depart from this formula. Instead of Poirot manipulating the reader, Sheppard manipulates both the reader and Poirot. The reader is unaware of this subterfuge, however, until the end of the novel, when all the other probable suspects have been eliminated and only Sheppard remains. The reader is then privy to Sheppard’s confession, and all the pieces to this very complex puzzle fall into place.

We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.

What’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.

Now, in Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom—and even of hope itself.

With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.",Everything Is F*cked: A Book About Hope,Mark Manson, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780062955951,"1st Published,2019",274,India,English

Soon after arriving at his hotel in Istanbul, private investigator Hercule Poirot is instructed to return to London immediately. He boards the Orient Express that very night and is accosted by Mr. Ratchett, whom he had earlier seen in his hotel in Istanbul. He attempts to hire Poirot believing that his life is under threat, but the detective refuses him outright.

On the second night of the journey, a snowdrift brings the train to a halt. A cry from Ratchett’s coach pierces the eerie silence of the night. The next morning, M. Bouc, the director of the company that operates the train and an acquaintance of Poirot, informs him of the shocking murder of Ratchett. Upon his request, Poirot agrees to investigate the case. Soon Poirot learns of Ratchett’s questionable past and the probable reasons for his murder.

In the United States a few years earlier, Daisy Armstrong, a 3 year old heiress was kidnapped and killed by a man, who went by the name Cassetti, in spite of collecting a ransom from her wealthy family. Suspected to have rigged the trial, Cassetti fled the country after his acquittal. Poirot came to the conclusion that Ratchett was none other than Cassetti.

What connects the people in Ratchett’s coach who were travelling with him on that fateful night of the murder? Is one of the members of the Armstrong family the murderer?

Murder on the Orient Express has been adapted to TV, film and radio as well. The book was first published in 1934.

#1 New York Times Bestseller!

In the second book of the Carve the Mark duology, globally bestselling Divergent author Veronica Roth reveals how Cyra and Akos fulfill their fates. The Fates Divide is a richly imagined tale of hope and resilience told in four stunning perspectives.

The lives of Cyra Noavek and Akos Kereseth are ruled by their fates, spoken by the oracles at their births. The fates, once determined, are inescapable.

Akos is in love with Cyra, in spite of his fate: He will die in service to Cyra’s family. And when Cyra’s father, Lazmet Noavek—a soulless tyrant, thought to be dead—reclaims the Shotet throne, Akos believes his end is closer than ever.

As Lazmet ignites a barbaric war, Cyra and Akos are desperate to stop him at any cost. For Cyra, that could mean taking the life of the man who may—or may not—be her father. For Akos, it could mean giving his own. In a stunning twist, the two will discover how fate defines their lives in ways most unexpected.

It was not that Stanton Rogers fancied himself a Casanova. On the contrary, until that one fatal bedroom escapade, he had been a model husband. He was handsome, wealthy, and on his way to one of the most important positions in the world, and although he had had ample opportunity to cheat on his wife, he had never given another woman a thought.",Windmills of the Gods,Sidney Sheldon, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9788172234829,"New Edition,2005",416,Abroad,English

The Fifth Mountain is set in the year 870 BC. Israel is being ruled by Phoenicians and Queen Jezebel wants to ensure that the people follow her own faith, one she brought from her native land. So, she orders the death of all those who do not bow down to her God, Baal.

One of these rebels is the Prophet Elijah. The Queen orders his death for refusing to obey her. Elijah flees to the lovely Phoenician city of Zarephath, which is also known by the Phoenician name of Akbar. This place was actually considered to be the abode of the God, though Elijah refused to acknowledge it.

There he meets a woman who is a worshipper of Baal. Though their religious views differ and she is older than him, Elijah and the woman are attracted to each other. But they don't discuss their feelings openly. Meanwhile, Elijah, who has been sent to this place by an angel, wants to rid Israel of the tyranny of Queen Jezebel.

But due to a surprising turn of events, the people of Akbar accept him as a sage. They consider him one of their own and come to him for advice and to settle disputes. As Elijah begins to bond with these people, he suffers from conflicting ambitions. He cannot decide whether to remain in Akbar, his adopted city, or to return to Israel. Subsequently, the destructive Assyrian invasion on Akbar worsens Elijah’s dilemma.
In The Fifth Mountain, through the context of a religious tale, the author conveys the importance of finding one's own destiny, even if it seems like it will involve rebelling against God's will. He insists that in doing so, one will find oneself getting closer to God.

Cards on the Table is a detective novel by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 2 November 1936 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence and the US edition at $2.00.

The book features the recurring characters of Hercule Poirot, Colonel Race, Superintendent Battle and the bumbling crime writer Ariadne Oliver, making her first appearance in a Poirot novel. The four detectives and four possible suspects play bridge after dinner with Mr Shaitana. At the end of the evening, Mr Shaitana is discovered murdered. Identifying the murderer, per Mrs Christie, depends wholly on discerning the psychology of the suspects.

This novel was well received at first printing and in later reviews. It was noted for its humour, for the subtlety of the writing, good clueing and tight writing, showing continuing improvement in the author's writing style in this, her twentieth novel. One later reviewer considered this in the top rung of her novels, and another found it to be most original, with a brilliant surprise ending.

In this compilation of eight marvellous short stories, Agatha Christie delights readers with the presence of her three male sleuths in six respective stories. Two stories each for Parker Pyne, the duo Harley Quin-Satterthwaite and Hercule Poirot ‘the police hound.’ In the two other, two women on a crossroads of their life are faced with difficult decision to make.


The map of Majorca, Spain where Parker Pyne has to resolve a rift between two women while on holiday.

Presumably first appeared in the UK magazines, seven of them were written in the twenties and in the  thirties. Only The Harlequin Tea Set was in 1971. Interestingly, the copyright of five of them were signed as Mrs. Mallowan; hence after her divorce in 1928.

Poirot’s cases concern with a reconstruction of a suicide and the death of an old eccentric well-to-do man who summons the Belgian to his home. In the former story, it starts when he receives a telephone call from a mysterious woman begging for his help. ‘…table with yellow irises,’ she sounds frightened  of being overheard. In the latter, a shot is heard moments after the first gong for dinner but a guest firmly believes of having heard the second gong. Four years later the same plot appears in Dead Man’s Mirror (see Notes On The Murder In The Mews) with alterations to the character names.

In the non-detective stories, two female protagonists must make her choice. On the one hand, it is between a dog or starvation in Next To A Dog; the dog being the very memory of a dead husband. On the other, Theodora Darrel undergoes a battle of will between loyalty vs happiness. Will she still walk out from her marriage having known that her husband has been in a serious charge of theft and fraud?
The Love Detectives (1926) seems to mark the early appearance of Harley Quin; an enigmatic man of whom his path is crossed with Mr. Satterthwaite’s on a number of occasions (see Notes On The Mysterious Mr. Quin). In a dark night both meets when their car collide; Sattwerthwaite is with Colonel Melrose on their way to a crime scene. An aristocrat has been killed with a bronze figure of Venus. Then his beautiful wife and a male guest whom stays over in the house confess of the murder. Who is one to believe?

Any readers who remember Mrs. Protheroe and Lawrence Redding     will understand what  occurs next in the story (see Notes On The Murder At The Vicarage).  The clock is changed to suit the alibi of a suspect and the study also becomes where the ‘thing’ happens. In Miss Marple’s case, however, the deceased’s wife and her

As the book begins, Athena is dead. How she ended up that way creates the intrigue sustaining the book. The child, Sherine Khalil renames herself Athena after her uncle was discussing with her mother on how her real name will betray her origins and something like Athena gave nothing away. As a child, she shows a strong religious vocation and reports seeing angels and saints, which both impresses and worries her parents.

She goes into a London University to pursue Engineering at the age of 19 but it's not what her heart wanted. One day she just decides that she wanted to drop out of college, get married and have a baby. Here, the author mentions that this might be due to the fact that she was abandoned herself and wants to give all that love she could to her child which she didn't receive from her birth mother. Two years later, her marriage falls apart because they are facing too many problems due to their young age and lack of money or mostly because he felt that she loved only the child and used him to get what she wanted. A very interesting quote she uses is ""From Ancient Greece on, the people who returned from battle were either dead on their shields or stronger, despite or because of their scars. It's better that way: I've lived on a battlefield since I was born, but I'm still alive and I don't need anyone to protect me."" She grows into a woman in search of answers to many questions that arise within a person. She had a life which many felt was content because she had a child of her own, money, and friends; everything but her mind was at peace, so she searches for the answer to the classical question of ""Who am I?"" through many experiences. In her quest, she opens her heart to intoxicating powers of mother and becomes a controversial spiritual leader in London.",The Witch of Portobello,Paulo Coelho, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780007257447,"1st Published,2007",324,India,English

Ashoke Ganguli and Ashima Ganguli, a couple away from their home in Bengal, are about to have their first child in Massachusetts. While Ashoke Ganguli is studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the young wife is lost in the alien land with not many around to help her and no friends she could talk to and hang out with. Now, their young boy has to be named by an elder person in the family, as a part of the tradition followed in Bengali families. This honour has been given to Ashima’s grandmother. Due to circumstances, the couple find out that they cannot leave the hospital without naming the child. Ashoke thus chooses the name of his favourite Russian author, Gogol, for time being. But when Ashima’s grandmother passes away before picking a name for her great grandson, the boy remains Gogol. Although he likes his name initially, he starts to dislike it by the time he begins going to high school. And he formally changes his name to Nikhil before leaving for higher studies, and becomes Nikhil Gogol Ganguli. Ashima is extremely unhappy with her son when he starts becoming more of an American, and Ashoke remains quiet about all this until he finds the right time to tell Gogol why he chose that name. The reason behind a name is what constitutes the soul of the story, which changes the young man forever. This timeless story will certainly leave in thoughts that overwhelm you each time you recall it.

The answer to the riddle is brilliant.""

Maurice Richardson was pleased to see the return of Poirot to Christie's works when he reviewed the novel in the 10 January 1943 issue of The Observer. He concluded, ""Despite only five suspects, Mrs. Christie, as usual, puts a ring through the reader's nose and leads him to one of her smashing last-minute showdowns. This is well up to the standard of her middle Poirot period. No more need be said.""

J.D. Beresford in The Guardian's 20 January 1943 review, wrote: ""Miss Agatha Christie never fails us, and her Five Little Pigs presents a very pretty problem for the ingenious reader."" It concluded that the clue to who committed the crime was, ""completely satisfying.""

Robert Barnard: ""The-murder-in-the-past plot on its first and best appearance – accept no later substitutes. Presentation more intricate than usual, characterization more subtle.""

																																										Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain.

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end.

This novel has been greatly appreciated by its readers, being labeled as the most important book of the 20th century by the Children’s Books Of The Century poll, published in Books For Keeps.

Grabbing every chance he could, Sidney worked nights as a bus-boy, a clerk, an usher - anything - but he dreamt of becoming something more.
His dream was to become a writer and to break into Hollywood. By a stroke of luck, he found work as a reader for David Selznick, a top Hollywood producer, and the dream began to materialise. Sheldon worked through the night writing stories for the movies, and librettos for the musical theatre. Little by little he gained a reputation and soon found himself in demand by the hottest producers and stars in Hollywood.

A novel rich in metaphors and symbolism, The Alchemist is a story based on the adventures of a young shepherd boy, who, upon deciding to follow his prophetic dreams, sets on a treasure hunt. This journey introduces him to some remarkable people who leave an indelible and profound mark on him.  

Summary Of The Book: 
The Alchemist was first published in 1988. The protagonist of the story, a young Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago, is plagued with recurring dreams, wherein a mysterious child urges him to look for buried treasure at the base of the Egyptian pyramids. Determined, he leaves Spain and heads towards Egypt. En route, he meets the King of Salem, a man named Melchizedek. Melchizedek introduces Santiago to the concept of a ‘Personal Legend’ or a personal map or a quest that guides him to what his heart truly desires.
While attempting to cross the Sahara desert on the way to Egypt, he joins a caravan which is driven by an Englishman who is aspiring to be an alchemist. During a stop over in Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets Fatima, a young girl of exceeding beauty who steals his heart. He asks her to marry him, but she declines saying that she will do so only once he has found the treasure he seeks. In the Saharan oasis of Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets a 200 year old alchemist who decides to accompany him on his expedition. He imparts wisdom and valuable knowledge to Santiago, who eventually understands why the supposed treasure keeps evading him.
Having sold over 65 million copies worldwide, The Alchemist is marked by its profound simplicity, the easy flow of the story, and the poignant moral it tries to teach the reader, that worldly possessions and extravagance are immaterial when compared to finding your own ‘Personal Legend’.",The Alchemist (About 150 Million Copies Sold),Paulo Coelho, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9788172234980,"1st Edition,2015",192,Abroad,English

Eleven Minutes is the story of Maria, a young girl from a small village in Brazil. She is disillusioned by her failures in love. She moves to Geneva, Switzerland, aspiring to live the life of her dreams - a life filled with fame and fortune. Her dreams are shattered when she is introduced to the harsh realities of life.

One day, a chance encounter with an Arab man earns her a thousand francs for one night. Lured by the prospect of easy money, she ends up becoming a prostitute in a brothel in Geneva’s red-light district. Once there, she quickly learns the ropes and becomes quite successful, not to mention the envy of her colleagues. She shuts the door on love and only has time for the demands made by her body.

Her life is thrown into disarray when she meets a young Swiss painter named Ralf. She falls in love with Ralf, who is completely different from her. Her carnal feelings for Ralf and her true love for him vie for supremacy. She finally decides to move away from Geneva because she sees no future for them. But just before she leaves, she discovers the beautiful blend of sex and true love with Ralf.

Maria’s journey begins with disillusionment. It brings about her sexual awakening and eventually, almost brings her to the point of self-destruction. She sinks to the depths of despair before her phoenix-like rise to self-discovery and the heights of love.

Maria’s story explores the concepts of sex, prostitution, sadomasochism, and true love.

Eleven Minutes was published in 2003. It was originally written in Portuguese, and has been translated into several languages since then.

Currently ranked World No. 1 in women's doubles, Sania Mirza became an instant sensation when she won the Wimbledon Championships girls' doubles title at the age of sixteen. From 2003 until her retirement from the singles circuit in 2012, she was ranked by the Women's Tennis Association as India's top player, both in singles and doubles. A six-time Grand Slam champion, she notched up an incredible forty-one consecutive wins with her doubles partner, Martina Hingis, between August 2015 and February 2016.

Ace against Odds is the story of this most iconic Indian player who beat incredible odds to get to the top of her sport. Sania writes with candour of the hardships along the way, of the physical and emotional trauma caused by injuries and medical procedures, of the friends and partners who became her mainstay along with her family, of the pressures of constant public scrutiny and, not least, the politics and heartbreaks that inevitably accompany success.

Sania broke the rules, she spoke her mind, she pushed herself to the limit, she played for India fiercely and without care for how it might impact her rankings - she is and will continue to remain an inspiration long after she steps off the tennis courts.(goodreads.com)",Ace Against Odds,Sania Mirza, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789351362630,"1st Edition,2016",288,India,English

As she feels that nothing can fill this void she decides one fine day that she is going to die and consumes several sleeping pills. While she is surprised to find herself still alive when she wakes up in a local mental hospital, she is told that her wish to die will come true in a matter of days as the overdose on the pills has caused irreparable damage to her heart. 
However, it is in these last few days of life that Veronika starts to actually appreciate things around her. She starts to feel things that she has never felt before like: love, fear, hatred, sexual awakening and curiosity.

Looking For Alaska, John Green’s debut novel was first published in 2005. Looking For Alaska follows the life of Miles Halter, as he leaves Florida to join boarding school in Alabama. He joins Culver Creek, the boarding school, later than usual, as he himself mentions that he is looking for a “Great Perhaps”.

Among his quirks include memorizing the last words of famous people and the “Great Perhaps” was that of Francois Rabelais. Miles receives the nickname Pudge in school, and though his was a figure that was nothing like the name entailed, it stuck.

His roommate and friend is Chip, who is the person who introduces him to Alaska Young, the Alaska mentioned in the title of the story. The adventures that they are involved in together cause him to fall in love with Alaska, and the entire book is written in first person. Most of the book is written as a countdown to a specific occurrence, which occurs in the rest of the book and it is easy to gather from the title, what this section would cover.

Though mostly mature and insightful, readers often get a peek into the sex addled mind of a sixteen year old school student, one who is forever counting the number of layers of clothing separating him from the bare body of the girl he is presently with.

Looking For Alaska won the 2006 Michael L. Printz Award from the American Library Association. It broke into the New York Times Bestseller list at number 10 in 2012, much after its debut in 2005. The film rights to the book have been sold to Paramount Pictures, though the project hasn’t been greenlighted yet due to lack of sufficient interest.

Hercule Poirot finds himself the uninvited guest at the scene of an elaborately planned murder on wheels. The Belgian detective is making his way from Istanbul, Turkey, to London, and he is looking forward to a leisurely trip and a chance to clear his head, a chance to rest his “little grey cells,” as Poirot refers to his brain.

A good friend of Poirot, M. Bouc, is an administrator with Wagon Lit, the train company that operates the Orient Express. Poirot prefers to travel first class. Because it is winter, off season for tourists, the detective is assured by Bouc that finding a first-class cabin on the train will be easy. To their surprise, the car leaving Istanbul, the Calais Coach, is nearly full. There is, however, one no-show, and Poirot finds himself sharing a compartment with Hector MacQueen, the private secretary to a wealthy American, Mr. Ratchett.

Poirot is introduced by Bouc to Dr. Constantine, a Greek physician, traveling in the next car. On the first night of the journey, as they sit in the dining car, Bouc points out to Poirot the variety of travelers in the dining car: the rich and the poor. Some are English, some American, some French, some Italian, some Russian, some Hungarian—an array of passengers from differing socioeconomic backgrounds and different cultures. Where else in the world, Bouc wonders aloud, could one find such an assortment of people beneath one roof? Yes, Poirot thinks to himself, perhaps only in America.

The first night passes peacefully, and Bouc moves Poirot from his shared cabin with MacQueen to a private one next door to Ratchett. During the second night of the trip, Poirot has trouble sleeping, awakened by voices, service bells summoning conductor Pierre Michel, and thumping on his cabin door. At about 1:15 a.m., Poirot sticks his head out of his cabin and sees a woman wearing a kimono with a dragon print walking down the corridor. He hears his neighbor, Ratchett, tell the conductor in perfect French that nothing is wrong and that he had not meant to ring his service bell. The train is stopped, too, as an avalanche of snow covers the tracks.

Ratchett, Poirot has determined, is an evil man. The evil shows on his face, and Poirot has taken an instant dislike in him. Earlier in the evening, Poirot had been approached by Ratchett and was offered a job—to keep Ratchett alive. Ratchett has been receiving hate mail and otherwise threatening letters.

This book, Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges, takes up the story from when A.P.J Abdul Kalam became the President of India. It covers his acceptance of the post of the President of India, his term in office, his efforts to make his term meaningful, and the challenges he faced.

His term from 2002 to 2007 was an eventful one. The President of India is just a titular head with minimal powers. But, the office is one of great influence and Kalam used it to best effect. He got the government and the public to focus on issues that were relevant to the country's all round growth.

He initiated programs like PURA to try and integrate rural areas into the general economic and technological growth of the country. He dreamt of taking the whole of India on his vision for the country in the new millennium, and he saw no reason why the villages should be left out in this vision.

Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges is more about Kalam’s vision for his country rather than about himself. He tries to provide a blueprint for development, and for reforms in the government and judiciary.

Dr.Kalam is a strong advocate for the use of technology and a proponent of e-governance. Even the little bits of personal experience during his term that he gives, he links with these ideas. For instance, he mentions the controversial dissolution of the Bihar assembly for which he later offered to resign. But, he does not focus on the political or personal implications of this decision, instead, he chose to highlight his use of electronic communication in lending his approval to this move, for he was in Moscow at that time.

He made the office of the President accessible to the public. He used his popularity and high visibility to inspire the youth of the country and convince them to believe in his 2020 vision for India. He urged the young people to dream big, and to believe in their country's destiny. Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges describes the term in office of one of the most charismatic Presidents of the country.

Winning, published in 2010, is a self-help management guide to help readers find answers to some of the most difficult questions of their professional lives. Winning starts off with an introduction, where Jack Welch says that the most commonly asked question is, What does it take to win?

The first part of the book, Underneath It All, describes Jack’s management philosophy. The author says that an organization should take ideas from every level, and not just the top leaders. The next part is titled Your Company, and focuses on the inner working of an organization. The authors speak about leadership, hiring, how to part ways, and crisis management. Your Competition is the third portion of Winning, and it speaks about the world outside of an organization.

Readers will learn how to devise meaningful budgets, grow through mergers and acquisitions, create strategic advantages, and make use of Six Sigma. In Your Career, the authors encourage readers to find the right job, to understand what it takes to get promoted, and learn how to handle a bad boss. Winning also says that maintaining a good work-life balance is essential. The last part, Tying Up Loose Ends, answers nine questions that do not fall in the above categories, like managing the China threat.

Winning is filled with personal stories and experiences, and has been written with a no-nonsense attitude. This book offers no easy solutions on how to win, as there really are none. This guide was on the top of The Wall Street Journal bestseller list, and has also been on The New York Times' bestseller list.

Balram Halwai narrates his life in a letter, written in seven consecutive nights and addressed to the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao. In his letter, Balram explains how he, the son of a puller, escaped a life of servitude to become a successful businessman, describing himself as an entrepreneur.

Balram was born in the rural village of Laxmangarh, where he lived with his grandmother, parents, brother and extended family. He is a smart child but is forced to leave school in order to help pay for his cousin's dowry and begins to work in a teashop with his brother in Dhanbad. While working there he begins to learn about India's government and economy from the customers' conversations. Balram describes himself as a bad servant but a good listener and decides to become a driver.

After learning how to drive, Balram finds a job driving Ashok, the son of one of Laxmangarh's landlords. He takes over the job of the main driver, from a small car to a heavy-luxury described Honda City. He stops sending money back to his family and disrespects his grandmother during a trip back to his village. Balram moves to New Delhi with Ashok and his wife Pinky Madam. Throughout their time in Delhi, Balram is exposed to extensive corruption, especially in the government. In Delhi, the contrast between the poor and the wealthy is made even more evident by their proximity to one another.

One night Pinky Madam takes the wheel from Balram, while drunk, hits something in the road and drives away; we are left to assume that she has killed a child. Ashok's family puts pressure on Balram to confess that he had been driving alone. Ashok becomes increasingly involved in bribing government officials for the benefit of the family coal business. Balram then decides that killing Ashok will be the only way to escape India's Rooster Coop. After bludgeoning Ashok with a bottle and stealing a large bribe, Balram moves to Bangalore, where he bribes the police in order to help start his own taxi business. Ashok too is portrayed to be trapped in the metaphorical Rooster Coop: his family controls what he does and society dictates how he acts. Just like Ashok, Balram pays off a family whose son one of his taxi drivers hit and killed. Balram explains that his own family was almost certainly killed by Ashok's relatives as retribution for his murder. At the end of the novel, Balram rationalizes his actions and considers that his freedom is worth the lives of his family and of Ashok. And thus ends the letter to Jiabao, letting the reader think of the dark humour of the tale, as well as the idea of life as a trap introduced by the writer.(wiki)",The White Tiger,Aravind Adiga, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789352645060,"Reprinted,2017",324,India,English

Pointing to the horizon where the sea and sky are joined, he says, ‘It is only an illusion because they can’t really meet, but isn’t it beautiful, this union which isn’t really there.’ – SAADAT HASAN MANTO Sometime in 2016, a series of dialogues took place which set out to find a meeting ground, even if only an illusion, between A.S. Dulat and Asad Durrani. One was a former chief of RAW, India’s external intelligence agency, the other of ISI, its Pakistani counterpart. As they could not meet in their home countries, the conversations, guided by journalist Aditya Sinha, took place in cities like Istanbul, Bangkok and Kathmandu. On the table were subjects that have long haunted South Asia, flashpoints that take lives regularly. It was in all ways a deep dive into the politics of the subcontinent, as seen through the eyes of two spymasters. Among the subjects: Kashmir, and a missed opportunity for peace; Hafiz Saeed and 26/11; Kulbhushan Jadhav; surgical strikes; the deal for Osama bin Laden; how the US and Russia feature in the India-Pakistan relationship; and how terror undermines the two countries’ attempts at talks. When the project was first mooted, General Durrani laughed and said nobody would believe it even if it was written as fiction. At a time of fraught relations, this unlikely dialogue between two former spy chiefs from opposite sides-a project that is the first of its kind-may well provide some answers.

How is it, then, that today the former British colonial trading post is a thriving Asian metropolis with not only the world's number one airline, best airport, and busiest port of trade, but also the world's fourth–highest per capita real income?

The story of that transformation is told here by Singapore's charismatic, controversial founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. Rising from a legacy of divisive colonialism, the devastation of the Second World War, and general poverty and disorder following the withdrawal of foreign forces, Singapore now is hailed as a city of the future. This miraculous history is dramatically recounted by the man who not only lived through it all but who fearlessly forged ahead and brought about most of these changes.

Delving deep into his own meticulous notes, as well as previously unpublished government papers and official records, Lee details the extraordinary efforts it took for an island city–state in Southeast Asia to survive at that time.

Lee explains how he and his cabinet colleagues finished off the communist threat to the fledgling state's security and began the arduous process of nation building: forging basic infrastructural roads through a land that still consisted primarily of swamps, creating an army from a hitherto racially and ideologically divided population, stamping out the last vestiges of colonial–era corruption, providing mass public housing, and establishing a national airline and airport.

In this illuminating account, Lee writes frankly about his trenchant approach to political opponents and his often unorthodox views on human rights, democracy, and inherited intelligence, aiming always ""to be correct, not politically correct."" Nothing in Singapore escaped his watchful eye: whether choosing shrubs for the greening of the country, restoring the romance of the historic Raffles Hotel, or openly, unabashedly persuading young men to marry women as well educated as themselves. Today's safe, tidy Singapore bears Lee's unmistakable stamp, for which he is unapologetic: ""If this is a nanny state, I am proud to have fostered one.""

Though Lee's domestic canvas in Singapore was small, his vigor and talent assured him a larger place in world affairs. With inimitable style, he brings history to life with cogent analyses of some of the greatest strategic issues of recent times and reveals how, over the years, he navigated the shifting tides of relations among America, China, and Taiwan, acting as confidant, sounding board, and messenger for them. He also includes candid, sometimes acerbic pen portraits of his political peers, including the indomitable Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, the poetry–spouting Jiang Zemin, and ideologues George Bush and Deng Xiaoping.

Lee also lifts the veil on his family life and writes tenderly of his wife and stalwart partner, Kwa Geok Choo, and of their pride in their three children –– particularly the eldest son, Hsien Loong, who is now Singapore's deputy prime minister.

For more than three decades, Lee Kuan Yew has been praised and vilified in equal measure, and he has established himself as a force impossible to ignore in Asian and international politics. From Third World to First offers readers a compelling glimpse into this visionary's heart, soul, and mind.",From Third World to First,Lee Kuan Yew, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780060197766,1st Edition,752,Abroad,English

Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain. 

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end. 
This novel has been greatly appreciated by its readers, being labeled as the most important book of the 20th century by the Children’s Books Of The Century poll, published in Books For Keeps. Although the exact number is not known, there have been 35-100 million copies of The Hobbit sold, till date, since it’s publishing in the year 1937. The Hobbit has also been adapted into a movie, whose first part, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey released in the United States on the 14th of December 2012. This movie was directed by Peter Jackson, and the second, and third parts are scheduled to release in 2013, and 2014.

A prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity set in the Sundarbans, an immense labyrinth of tiny islands on the easternmost coast of India.

The Hungry Tide is a very contemporary story of adventure and unlikely love, identity and history, set in one of the most fascinating regions on the earth. Off the easternmost coast of India, in the Bay of Bengal, lies the immense labyrinth of tiny islands known as the Sundarbans. 

For settlers here, life is extremely precarious. Attacks by deadly tigers are common. Unrest and eviction are constant threats. Without warning, at any time, tidal floods rise and surge over the land, leaving devastation in their wake. In this place of vengeful beauty, the lives of three people from different worlds collide. Piya Roy is a young marine biologist, of Indian descent but stubbornly American, in search of a rare, endangered river dolphin. 

Her journey begins with a disaster, when she is thrown from a boat into crocodile-infested waters. Rescue comes in the form of a young, illiterate fisherman, Fokir. Although they have no language between them, Piya and Fokir are powerfully drawn to each other, sharing an uncanny instinct for the ways of the sea. Piya engages Fokir to help with her research and finds a translator in Kanai Dutt, a businessman from Delhi whose idealistic aunt and uncle are longtime settlers in the Sundarbans. 

As the three of them launch into the elaborate backwaters, they are drawn unawares into the hidden undercurrents of this isolated world, where political turmoil exacts a personal toll that is every bit as powerful as the ravaging tide. Already an international success, The Hungry Tide is a prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity.",The Hungry Tide,Amitav Ghosh, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780007432974,"1st Edition,2004",403,Abroad,English

Sidney Sheldon’s Tell Me Your Dreams introduces three very different women at the onset of the novel. Introduced first is Ashley Peterson, a beautiful young woman who works for a computer company in Silicon Valley. Ashley is single and convinced she is being stalked. Readers next meet Ashley’s co-workers, Toni and Alette. Toni Prescott, a British woman in her early twenties is rather bold and striking. Rounding out the trio is Alette Peters, a quiet, dreamy romantic who moved to California from Rome. In the early stages of the novel, quite a few murders are committed and police in Chicago, San Francisco, and Quebec are desperate to solve the gruesome crimes that have taken place in each of their cities. Conclusive evidence points to one suspect and one suspect alone.

As the story develops, the reader learns why Ashley feels so alone in the world. She is the only child of a world-famous heart surgeon, who is often critical and overbearing. Although Ashley loves her father, she does not necessarily love his company and tries to avoid him. Toni is a provocateur with a penchant for song who suffered a strained relationship with her mother. Alette is a gifted artist who lacks self-confidence. As the novel draws to a conclusion, Ashley, Toni, and Alette are proven to be one in the same.

The reader will not be disappointed with Sheldon’s storytelling upon finishing this book. Sheldon provides a fascinating and precise examination of the different aspects of multiple personality disorder through the characters of Ashley, Toni, and Alette. He expertly draws the reader into his story, just as a fly is drawn into a spider’s web. Although this novel was a great effort, it is not one of Sheldon’s best—as portions of the plot are predictable. Sheldon’s ending, however, does have some panache.

The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was Christie’s sixth novel and was published in 1926. It was the third novel that featured the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Like many of her other novels, the book is set in a small town and focuses on the interactions between characters who are well known to one another.

When the novel was first published, critical reactions were mixed because of the unusual narrative structure. Christie chose to have the murderer tell the story from his point of view. This device caused some consternation because some believed that Christie was not “playing fair” with her readers. They reasoned that, in crime fiction, if the novel is to be fair, the reader should be able to follow the same path the detective does in order to solve the crime. Some believed that by having the narrator as the murderer, the reader would not be able to follow the path of the clues, since the murderer would, in order to protect his identity, conceal certain key pieces of information.

Christie circumvents this problem in several ways. First, Dr. Sheppard is an extremely believable character. Because of the remorseful tone he assumes at the beginning of the novel, the reader immediately trusts him and his observations. In addition, Poirot appears to trust Sheppard, including him in discussions with the police and, as Poirot admits, using Sheppard as a substitute for Captain Hastings, who had played Dr. Watson to Poirot’s Sherlock Holmes in previous novels. Thus, the reader is led to trust Sheppard because Poirot trusts him.

Sheppard also establishes an intimate rapport with the reader through the use of first-person narrative. The reader is privy to what are assumed to be the doctor’s private thoughts about Ackroyd’s murder. Poirot also confides in Sheppard and often asks his opinion of people within the town. Again, this action on the part of Christie serves to inspire confidence in the narrator; the reader does not suspect him because Poirot does not, and because Christie has, as in previous novels, established Poirot as a reliable source and a good judge of human nature.

Another aspect to the novel in regard to the narration is the comparatively small role that Poirot plays. The reader is accustomed to seeing him as the main character—almost as a master puppeteer who guides the movements of all around him. In fact, the readers expect Poirot to manipulate them, for this is the nature of crime fiction in general: The reader is manipulated by the detective to see things his or her way. Christie, however, chooses to radically depart from this formula. Instead of Poirot manipulating the reader, Sheppard manipulates both the reader and Poirot. The reader is unaware of this subterfuge, however, until the end of the novel, when all the other probable suspects have been eliminated and only Sheppard remains. The reader is then privy to Sheppard’s confession, and all the pieces to this very complex puzzle fall into place.

We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.

What’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.

Now, in Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom—and even of hope itself.

With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.",Everything Is F*cked: A Book About Hope,Mark Manson, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780062955951,"1st Published,2019",274,India,English

Soon after arriving at his hotel in Istanbul, private investigator Hercule Poirot is instructed to return to London immediately. He boards the Orient Express that very night and is accosted by Mr. Ratchett, whom he had earlier seen in his hotel in Istanbul. He attempts to hire Poirot believing that his life is under threat, but the detective refuses him outright.

On the second night of the journey, a snowdrift brings the train to a halt. A cry from Ratchett’s coach pierces the eerie silence of the night. The next morning, M. Bouc, the director of the company that operates the train and an acquaintance of Poirot, informs him of the shocking murder of Ratchett. Upon his request, Poirot agrees to investigate the case. Soon Poirot learns of Ratchett’s questionable past and the probable reasons for his murder.

In the United States a few years earlier, Daisy Armstrong, a 3 year old heiress was kidnapped and killed by a man, who went by the name Cassetti, in spite of collecting a ransom from her wealthy family. Suspected to have rigged the trial, Cassetti fled the country after his acquittal. Poirot came to the conclusion that Ratchett was none other than Cassetti.

What connects the people in Ratchett’s coach who were travelling with him on that fateful night of the murder? Is one of the members of the Armstrong family the murderer?

Murder on the Orient Express has been adapted to TV, film and radio as well. The book was first published in 1934.

#1 New York Times Bestseller!

In the second book of the Carve the Mark duology, globally bestselling Divergent author Veronica Roth reveals how Cyra and Akos fulfill their fates. The Fates Divide is a richly imagined tale of hope and resilience told in four stunning perspectives.

The lives of Cyra Noavek and Akos Kereseth are ruled by their fates, spoken by the oracles at their births. The fates, once determined, are inescapable.

Akos is in love with Cyra, in spite of his fate: He will die in service to Cyra’s family. And when Cyra’s father, Lazmet Noavek—a soulless tyrant, thought to be dead—reclaims the Shotet throne, Akos believes his end is closer than ever.

As Lazmet ignites a barbaric war, Cyra and Akos are desperate to stop him at any cost. For Cyra, that could mean taking the life of the man who may—or may not—be her father. For Akos, it could mean giving his own. In a stunning twist, the two will discover how fate defines their lives in ways most unexpected.

The Fifth Mountain is set in the year 870 BC. Israel is being ruled by Phoenicians and Queen Jezebel wants to ensure that the people follow her own faith, one she brought from her native land. So, she orders the death of all those who do not bow down to her God, Baal.

One of these rebels is the Prophet Elijah. The Queen orders his death for refusing to obey her. Elijah flees to the lovely Phoenician city of Zarephath, which is also known by the Phoenician name of Akbar. This place was actually considered to be the abode of the God, though Elijah refused to acknowledge it.

There he meets a woman who is a worshipper of Baal. Though their religious views differ and she is older than him, Elijah and the woman are attracted to each other. But they don't discuss their feelings openly. Meanwhile, Elijah, who has been sent to this place by an angel, wants to rid Israel of the tyranny of Queen Jezebel.

But due to a surprising turn of events, the people of Akbar accept him as a sage. They consider him one of their own and come to him for advice and to settle disputes. As Elijah begins to bond with these people, he suffers from conflicting ambitions. He cannot decide whether to remain in Akbar, his adopted city, or to return to Israel. Subsequently, the destructive Assyrian invasion on Akbar worsens Elijah’s dilemma.
In The Fifth Mountain, through the context of a religious tale, the author conveys the importance of finding one's own destiny, even if it seems like it will involve rebelling against God's will. He insists that in doing so, one will find oneself getting closer to God.

Cards on the Table is a detective novel by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 2 November 1936 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence and the US edition at $2.00.

The book features the recurring characters of Hercule Poirot, Colonel Race, Superintendent Battle and the bumbling crime writer Ariadne Oliver, making her first appearance in a Poirot novel. The four detectives and four possible suspects play bridge after dinner with Mr Shaitana. At the end of the evening, Mr Shaitana is discovered murdered. Identifying the murderer, per Mrs Christie, depends wholly on discerning the psychology of the suspects.

This novel was well received at first printing and in later reviews. It was noted for its humour, for the subtlety of the writing, good clueing and tight writing, showing continuing improvement in the author's writing style in this, her twentieth novel. One later reviewer considered this in the top rung of her novels, and another found it to be most original, with a brilliant surprise ending.

In this compilation of eight marvellous short stories, Agatha Christie delights readers with the presence of her three male sleuths in six respective stories. Two stories each for Parker Pyne, the duo Harley Quin-Satterthwaite and Hercule Poirot ‘the police hound.’ In the two other, two women on a crossroads of their life are faced with difficult decision to make.


The map of Majorca, Spain where Parker Pyne has to resolve a rift between two women while on holiday.

Presumably first appeared in the UK magazines, seven of them were written in the twenties and in the  thirties. Only The Harlequin Tea Set was in 1971. Interestingly, the copyright of five of them were signed as Mrs. Mallowan; hence after her divorce in 1928.

Poirot’s cases concern with a reconstruction of a suicide and the death of an old eccentric well-to-do man who summons the Belgian to his home. In the former story, it starts when he receives a telephone call from a mysterious woman begging for his help. ‘…table with yellow irises,’ she sounds frightened  of being overheard. In the latter, a shot is heard moments after the first gong for dinner but a guest firmly believes of having heard the second gong. Four years later the same plot appears in Dead Man’s Mirror (see Notes On The Murder In The Mews) with alterations to the character names.

In the non-detective stories, two female protagonists must make her choice. On the one hand, it is between a dog or starvation in Next To A Dog; the dog being the very memory of a dead husband. On the other, Theodora Darrel undergoes a battle of will between loyalty vs happiness. Will she still walk out from her marriage having known that her husband has been in a serious charge of theft and fraud?
The Love Detectives (1926) seems to mark the early appearance of Harley Quin; an enigmatic man of whom his path is crossed with Mr. Satterthwaite’s on a number of occasions (see Notes On The Mysterious Mr. Quin). In a dark night both meets when their car collide; Sattwerthwaite is with Colonel Melrose on their way to a crime scene. An aristocrat has been killed with a bronze figure of Venus.

As the book begins, Athena is dead. How she ended up that way creates the intrigue sustaining the book. The child, Sherine Khalil renames herself Athena after her uncle was discussing with her mother on how her real name will betray her origins and something like Athena gave nothing away. As a child, she shows a strong religious vocation and reports seeing angels and saints, which both impresses and worries her parents.

She goes into a London University to pursue Engineering at the age of 19 but it's not what her heart wanted. One day she just decides that she wanted to drop out of college, get married and have a baby. Here, the author mentions that this might be due to the fact that she was abandoned herself and wants to give all that love she could to her child which she didn't receive from her birth mother. Two years later, her marriage falls apart because they are facing too many problems due to their young age and lack of money or mostly because he felt that she loved only the child and used him to get what she wanted. A very interesting quote she uses is ""From Ancient Greece on, the people who returned from battle were either dead on their shields or stronger, despite or because of their scars. It's better that way: I've lived on a battlefield since I was born, but I'm still alive and I don't need anyone to protect me."" She grows into a woman in search of answers to many questions that arise within a person. She had a life which many felt was content because she had a child of her own, money, and friends; everything but her mind was at peace, so she searches for the answer to the classical question of ""Who am I?"" through many experiences. In her quest, she opens her heart to intoxicating powers of mother and becomes a controversial spiritual leader in London.",The Witch of Portobello,Paulo Coelho, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780007257447,"1st Published,2007",324,India,English

While Ashoke Ganguli is studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the young wife is lost in the alien land with not many around to help her and no friends she could talk to and hang out with. Now, their young boy has to be named by an elder person in the family, as a part of the tradition followed in Bengali families. This honour has been given to Ashima’s grandmother. Due to circumstances, the couple find out that they cannot leave the hospital without naming the child. Ashoke thus chooses the name of his favourite Russian author, Gogol, for time being. But when Ashima’s grandmother passes away before picking a name for her great grandson, the boy remains Gogol. Although he likes his name initially, he starts to dislike it by the time he begins going to high school. And he formally changes his name to Nikhil before leaving for higher studies, and becomes Nikhil Gogol Ganguli. Ashima is extremely unhappy with her son when he starts becoming more of an American, and Ashoke remains quiet about all this until he finds the right time to tell Gogol why he chose that name. The reason behind a name is what constitutes the soul of the story, which changes the young man forever.

Maurice Willson Disher's review in The Times Literary Supplement of 16 January 1943 concluded, ""No crime enthusiast will object that the story of how the painter died has to be told many times, for this, even if it creates an interest which is more problem than plot, demonstrates the author's uncanny skill. The answer to the riddle is brilliant.""

Maurice Richardson was pleased to see the return of Poirot to Christie's works when he reviewed the novel in the 10 January 1943 issue of The Observer. He concluded, ""Despite only five suspects, Mrs. Christie, as usual, puts a ring through the reader's nose and leads him to one of her smashing last-minute showdowns. This is well up to the standard of her middle Poirot period. No more need be said.""

J.D. Beresford in The Guardian's 20 January 1943 review, wrote: ""Miss Agatha Christie never fails us, and her Five Little Pigs presents a very pretty problem for the ingenious reader."" It concluded that the clue to who committed the crime was, ""completely satisfying.""

Robert Barnard: ""The-murder-in-the-past plot on its first and best appearance – accept no later substitutes. Presentation more intricate than usual, characterization more subtle."" All in all, it is a beautifully tailored book, rich and satisfying. The present writer would be willing to chance his arm and say that this is the best Christie of all.""

As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain.

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them.

Summary Of The Book: 
The Alchemist was first published in 1988. The protagonist of the story, a young Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago, is plagued with recurring dreams, wherein a mysterious child urges him to look for buried treasure at the base of the Egyptian pyramids. Determined, he leaves Spain and heads towards Egypt. En route, he meets the King of Salem, a man named Melchizedek. Melchizedek introduces Santiago to the concept of a ‘Personal Legend’ or a personal map or a quest that guides him to what his heart truly desires.
While attempting to cross the Sahara desert on the way to Egypt, he joins a caravan which is driven by an Englishman who is aspiring to be an alchemist. During a stop over in Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets Fatima, a young girl of exceeding beauty who steals his heart. He asks her to marry him, but she declines saying that she will do so only once he has found the treasure he seeks. In the Saharan oasis of Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets a 200 year old alchemist who decides to accompany him on his expedition. He imparts wisdom and valuable knowledge to Santiago, who eventually understands why the supposed treasure keeps evading him.
Having sold over 65 million copies worldwide, The Alchemist is marked by its profound simplicity, the easy flow of the story, and the poignant moral it tries to teach the reader, that worldly possessions and extravagance are immaterial when compared to finding your own ‘Personal Legend’.",The Alchemist (About 150 Million Copies Sold),Paulo Coelho, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9788172234980,"1st Edition,2015",192,Abroad,English

Currently ranked World No. 1 in women's doubles, Sania Mirza became an instant sensation when she won the Wimbledon Championships girls' doubles title at the age of sixteen. From 2003 until her retirement from the singles circuit in 2012, she was ranked by the Women's Tennis Association as India's top player, both in singles and doubles. A six-time Grand Slam champion, she notched up an incredible forty-one consecutive wins with her doubles partner, Martina Hingis, between August 2015 and February 2016.

Ace against Odds is the story of this most iconic Indian player who beat incredible odds to get to the top of her sport. Sania writes with candour of the hardships along the way, of the physical and emotional trauma caused by injuries and medical procedures, of the friends and partners who became her mainstay along with her family, of the pressures of constant public scrutiny and, not least, the politics and heartbreaks that inevitably accompany success.

Sania broke the rules, she spoke her mind, she pushed herself to the limit, she played for India fiercely and without care for how it might impact her rankings - she is and will continue to remain an inspiration long after she steps off the tennis courts.(goodreads.com)",Ace Against Odds,Sania Mirza, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789351362630,"1st Edition,2016",288,India,English

Veronika has everything that a young woman can think of having, but still isn’t satisfied with this as she feels a void within her. As she feels that nothing can fill this void she decides one fine day that she is going to die and consumes several sleeping pills. While she is surprised to find herself still alive when she wakes up in a local mental hospital, she is told that her wish to die will come true in a matter of days as the overdose on the pills has caused irreparable damage to her heart. 
However, it is in these last few days of life that Veronika starts to actually appreciate things around her. She starts to feel things that she has never felt before like: love, fear, hatred, sexual awakening and curiosity.

Looking For Alaska, John Green’s debut novel was first published in 2005. Looking For Alaska follows the life of Miles Halter, as he leaves Florida to join boarding school in Alabama. He joins Culver Creek, the boarding school, later than usual, as he himself mentions that he is looking for a “Great Perhaps”.

Among his quirks include memorizing the last words of famous people and the “Great Perhaps” was that of Francois Rabelais. Miles receives the nickname Pudge in school, and though his was a figure that was nothing like the name entailed, it stuck.

His roommate and friend is Chip, who is the person who introduces him to Alaska Young, the Alaska mentioned in the title of the story. The adventures that they are involved in together cause him to fall in love with Alaska, and the entire book is written in first person. Most of the book is written as a countdown to a specific occurrence, which occurs in the rest of the book and it is easy to gather from the title, what this section would cover.

Though mostly mature and insightful, readers often get a peek into the sex addled mind of a sixteen year old school student, one who is forever counting the number of layers of clothing separating him from the bare body of the girl he is presently with.

Looking For Alaska won the 2006 Michael L. Printz Award from the American Library Association. It broke into the New York Times Bestseller list at number 10 in 2012, much after its debut in 2005. The film rights to the book have been sold to Paramount Pictures, though the project hasn’t been greenlighted yet due to lack of sufficient interest.

After dinner, they’re all charged with their respective crimes by a gramophone recording. They can’t escape their would-be killer, who threatens to kill them in a manner similar to the old nursery rhyme, “ten little Indian boys.” Can they survive this nightmarish episode, or will they be doomed to die for their crimes?

Hercule Poirot finds himself the uninvited guest at the scene of an elaborately planned murder on wheels. The Belgian detective is making his way from Istanbul, Turkey, to London, and he is looking forward to a leisurely trip and a chance to clear his head, a chance to rest his “little grey cells,” as Poirot refers to his brain.

A good friend of Poirot, M. Bouc, is an administrator with Wagon Lit, the train company that operates the Orient Express. Poirot prefers to travel first class. Because it is winter, off season for tourists, the detective is assured by Bouc that finding a first-class cabin on the train will be easy. To their surprise, the car leaving Istanbul, the Calais Coach, is nearly full. There is, however, one no-show, and Poirot finds himself sharing a compartment with Hector MacQueen, the private secretary to a wealthy American, Mr. Ratchett.

Poirot is introduced by Bouc to Dr. Constantine, a Greek physician, traveling in the next car. On the first night of the journey, as they sit in the dining car, Bouc points out to Poirot the variety of travelers in the dining car: the rich and the poor. Some are English, some American, some French, some Italian, some Russian, some Hungarian—an array of passengers from differing socioeconomic backgrounds and different cultures. Where else in the world, Bouc wonders aloud, could one find such an assortment of people beneath one roof? Yes, Poirot thinks to himself, perhaps only in America.

The first night passes peacefully, and Bouc moves Poirot from his shared cabin with MacQueen to a private one next door to Ratchett. During the second night of the trip, Poirot has trouble sleeping, awakened by voices, service bells summoning conductor Pierre Michel, and thumping on his cabin door. At about 1:15 a.m., Poirot sticks his head out of his cabin and sees a woman wearing a kimono with a dragon print walking down the corridor. He hears his neighbor, Ratchett, tell the conductor in perfect French that nothing is wrong and that he had not meant to ring his service bell. The train is stopped, too, as an avalanche of snow covers the tracks.

Ratchett, Poirot has determined, is an evil man. The evil shows on his face, and Poirot has taken an instant dislike in him. Earlier in the evening, Poirot had been approached by Ratchett and was offered a job—to keep Ratchett alive. Ratchett has been receiving hate mail and otherwise threatening letters.

This book, Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges, takes up the story from when A.P.J Abdul Kalam became the President of India. It covers his acceptance of the post of the President of India, his term in office, his efforts to make his term meaningful, and the challenges he faced.

His term from 2002 to 2007 was an eventful one. The President of India is just a titular head with minimal powers. But, the office is one of great influence and Kalam used it to best effect. He got the government and the public to focus on issues that were relevant to the country's all round growth.

He initiated programs like PURA to try and integrate rural areas into the general economic and technological growth of the country. He dreamt of taking the whole of India on his vision for the country in the new millennium, and he saw no reason why the villages should be left out in this vision.

Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges is more about Kalam’s vision for his country rather than about himself. He tries to provide a blueprint for development, and for reforms in the government and judiciary.

Dr.Kalam is a strong advocate for the use of technology and a proponent of e-governance. Even the little bits of personal experience during his term that he gives, he links with these ideas. For instance, he mentions the controversial dissolution of the Bihar assembly for which he later offered to resign. But, he does not focus on the political or personal implications of this decision, instead, he chose to highlight his use of electronic communication in lending his approval to this move, for he was in Moscow at that time.

He made the office of the President accessible to the public. He used his popularity and high visibility to inspire the youth of the country and convince them to believe in his 2020 vision for India. He urged the young people to dream big, and to believe in their country's destiny. Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges describes the term in office of one of the most charismatic Presidents of the country.

About A.P.J. Abdul Kalam

Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is a renowned scientist, writer, administrator and former President of India.

Other books by Dr. Kalam - Developments in Fluid Mechanics and Space Technology, Ignited Minds: Unleashing the Power Within India, The Luminous Sparks, India 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium, and Wings of Fire: An Autobiography.

He has written autobiographies and books that detail his vision for the future of the country.

He then moved to Madras and studied Aerospace Engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology. After finishing his studies, he joined the DRDO’s Aeronautical Development Establishment.

Winning, published in 2010, is a self-help management guide to help readers find answers to some of the most difficult questions of their professional lives. Winning starts off with an introduction, where Jack Welch says that the most commonly asked question is, What does it take to win?

The first part of the book, Underneath It All, describes Jack’s management philosophy. The author says that an organization should take ideas from every level, and not just the top leaders. The next part is titled Your Company, and focuses on the inner working of an organization. The authors speak about leadership, hiring, how to part ways, and crisis management. Your Competition is the third portion of Winning, and it speaks about the world outside of an organization.

Readers will learn how to devise meaningful budgets, grow through mergers and acquisitions, create strategic advantages, and make use of Six Sigma. In Your Career, the authors encourage readers to find the right job, to understand what it takes to get promoted, and learn how to handle a bad boss. Winning also says that maintaining a good work-life balance is essential. The last part, Tying Up Loose Ends, answers nine questions that do not fall in the above categories, like managing the China threat.

Winning is filled with personal stories and experiences, and has been written with a no-nonsense attitude. This book offers no easy solutions on how to win, as there really are none. This guide was on the top of The Wall Street Journal bestseller list, and has also been on The New York Times' bestseller list.

He takes over the job of the main driver, from a small car to a heavy-luxury described Honda City. He stops sending money back to his family and disrespects his grandmother during a trip back to his village. Balram moves to New Delhi with Ashok and his wife Pinky Madam. Throughout their time in Delhi, Balram is exposed to extensive corruption, especially in the government. In Delhi, the contrast between the poor and the wealthy is made even more evident by their proximity to one another.

One night Pinky Madam takes the wheel from Balram, while drunk, hits something in the road and drives away; we are left to assume that she has killed a child. Ashok's family puts pressure on Balram to confess that he had been driving alone. Ashok becomes increasingly involved in bribing government officials for the benefit of the family coal business. Balram then decides that killing Ashok will be the only way to escape India's Rooster Coop. After bludgeoning Ashok with a bottle and stealing a large bribe, Balram moves to Bangalore, where he bribes the police in order to help start his own taxi business. Ashok too is portrayed to be trapped in the metaphorical Rooster Coop: his family controls what he does and society dictates how he acts. Just like Ashok, Balram pays off a family whose son one of his taxi drivers hit and killed. Balram explains that his own family was almost certainly killed by Ashok's relatives as retribution for his murder. At the end of the novel, Balram rationalizes his actions and considers that his freedom is worth the lives of his family and of Ashok. And thus ends the letter to Jiabao, letting the reader think of the dark humour of the tale, as well as the idea of life as a trap introduced by the writer.(wiki)",The White Tiger,Aravind Adiga, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789352645060,"Reprinted,2017",324,India,English

Pointing to the horizon where the sea and sky are joined, he says, ‘It is only an illusion because they can’t really meet, but isn’t it beautiful, this union which isn’t really there.’ – SAADAT HASAN MANTO Sometime in 2016, a series of dialogues took place which set out to find a meeting ground, even if only an illusion, between A.S. Dulat and Asad Durrani. One was a former chief of RAW, India’s external intelligence agency, the other of ISI, its Pakistani counterpart. As they could not meet in their home countries, the conversations, guided by journalist Aditya Sinha, took place in cities like Istanbul, Bangkok and Kathmandu. On the table were subjects that have long haunted South Asia, flashpoints that take lives regularly. It was in all ways a deep dive into the politics of the subcontinent, as seen through the eyes of two spymasters. Among the subjects: Kashmir, and a missed opportunity for peace; Hafiz Saeed and 26/11; Kulbhushan Jadhav; surgical strikes; the deal for Osama bin Laden; how the US and Russia feature in the India-Pakistan relationship; and how terror undermines the two countries’ attempts at talks. When the project was first mooted, General Durrani laughed and said nobody would believe it even if it was written as fiction. At a time of fraught relations, this unlikely dialogue between two former spy chiefs from opposite sides-a project that is the first of its kind-may well provide some answers.

How is it, then, that today the former British colonial trading post is a thriving Asian metropolis with not only the world's number one airline, best airport, and busiest port of trade, but also the world's fourth–highest per capita real income?

The story of that transformation is told here by Singapore's charismatic, controversial founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. Rising from a legacy of divisive colonialism, the devastation of the Second World War, and general poverty and disorder following the withdrawal of foreign forces, Singapore now is hailed as a city of the future. This miraculous history is dramatically recounted by the man who not only lived through it all but who fearlessly forged ahead and brought about most of these changes.

Delving deep into his own meticulous notes, as well as previously unpublished government papers and official records, Lee details the extraordinary efforts it took for an island city–state in Southeast Asia to survive at that time.

Lee explains how he and his cabinet colleagues finished off the communist threat to the fledgling state's security and began the arduous process of nation building: forging basic infrastructural roads through a land that still consisted primarily of swamps, creating an army from a hitherto racially and ideologically divided population, stamping out the last vestiges of colonial–era corruption, providing mass public housing, and establishing a national airline and airport.

In this illuminating account, Lee writes frankly about his trenchant approach to political opponents and his often unorthodox views on human rights, democracy, and inherited intelligence, aiming always ""to be correct, not politically correct."" Nothing in Singapore escaped his watchful eye: whether choosing shrubs for the greening of the country, restoring the romance of the historic Raffles Hotel, or openly, unabashedly persuading young men to marry women as well educated as themselves. Today's safe, tidy Singapore bears Lee's unmistakable stamp, for which he is unapologetic: ""If this is a nanny state, I am proud to have fostered one.""

Though Lee's domestic canvas in Singapore was small, his vigor and talent assured him a larger place in world affairs. With inimitable style, he brings history to life with cogent analyses of some of the greatest strategic issues of recent times and reveals how, over the years, he navigated the shifting tides of relations among America, China, and Taiwan, acting as confidant, sounding board, and messenger for them. He also includes candid, sometimes acerbic pen portraits of his political peers, including the indomitable Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, the poetry–spouting Jiang Zemin, and ideologues George Bush and Deng Xiaoping.

Lee also lifts the veil on his family life and writes tenderly of his wife and stalwart partner, Kwa Geok Choo, and of their pride in their three children –– particularly the eldest son, Hsien Loong, who is now Singapore's deputy prime minister.

For more than three decades, Lee Kuan Yew has been praised and vilified in equal measure, and he has established himself as a force impossible to ignore in Asian and international politics. From Third World to First offers readers a compelling glimpse into this visionary's heart, soul, and mind.",From Third World to First,Lee Kuan Yew, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780060197766,1st Edition,752,Abroad,English

Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain. 

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end. 
This novel has been greatly appreciated by its readers, being labeled as the most important book of the 20th century by the Children’s Books Of The Century poll, published in Books For Keeps. Although the exact number is not known, there have been 35-100 million copies of The Hobbit sold, till date, since it’s publishing in the year 1937. The Hobbit has also been adapted into a movie, whose first part, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey released in the United States on the 14th of December 2012. This movie was directed by Peter Jackson, and the second, and third parts are scheduled to release in 2013, and 2014.

A prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity set in the Sundarbans, an immense labyrinth of tiny islands on the easternmost coast of India.

The Hungry Tide is a very contemporary story of adventure and unlikely love, identity and history, set in one of the most fascinating regions on the earth. Off the easternmost coast of India, in the Bay of Bengal, lies the immense labyrinth of tiny islands known as the Sundarbans. 

For settlers here, life is extremely precarious. Attacks by deadly tigers are common. Unrest and eviction are constant threats. Without warning, at any time, tidal floods rise and surge over the land, leaving devastation in their wake. In this place of vengeful beauty, the lives of three people from different worlds collide. Piya Roy is a young marine biologist, of Indian descent but stubbornly American, in search of a rare, endangered river dolphin. 

Her journey begins with a disaster, when she is thrown from a boat into crocodile-infested waters. Rescue comes in the form of a young, illiterate fisherman, Fokir. Although they have no language between them, Piya and Fokir are powerfully drawn to each other, sharing an uncanny instinct for the ways of the sea. Piya engages Fokir to help with her research and finds a translator in Kanai Dutt, a businessman from Delhi whose idealistic aunt and uncle are longtime settlers in the Sundarbans. 

As the three of them launch into the elaborate backwaters, they are drawn unawares into the hidden undercurrents of this isolated world, where political turmoil exacts a personal toll that is every bit as powerful as the ravaging tide. Already an international success, The Hungry Tide is a prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity.",The Hungry Tide,Amitav Ghosh, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780007432974,"1st Edition,2004",403,Abroad,English

Sidney Sheldon’s Tell Me Your Dreams introduces three very different women at the onset of the novel. Introduced first is Ashley Peterson, a beautiful young woman who works for a computer company in Silicon Valley. Ashley is single and convinced she is being stalked. Readers next meet Ashley’s co-workers, Toni and Alette. Toni Prescott, a British woman in her early twenties is rather bold and striking. Rounding out the trio is Alette Peters, a quiet, dreamy romantic who moved to California from Rome. In the early stages of the novel, quite a few murders are committed and police in Chicago, San Francisco, and Quebec are desperate to solve the gruesome crimes that have taken place in each of their cities. Conclusive evidence points to one suspect and one suspect alone.

As the story develops, the reader learns why Ashley feels so alone in the world. She is the only child of a world-famous heart surgeon, who is often critical and overbearing. Although Ashley loves her father, she does not necessarily love his company and tries to avoid him. Toni is a provocateur with a penchant for song who suffered a strained relationship with her mother. Alette is a gifted artist who lacks self-confidence. As the novel draws to a conclusion, Ashley, Toni, and Alette are proven to be one in the same.

The reader will not be disappointed with Sheldon’s storytelling upon finishing this book. Sheldon provides a fascinating and precise examination of the different aspects of multiple personality disorder through the characters of Ashley, Toni, and Alette. He expertly draws the reader into his story, just as a fly is drawn into a spider’s web. Although this novel was a great effort, it is not one of Sheldon’s best—as portions of the plot are predictable. Sheldon’s ending, however, does have some panache.

The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was Christie’s sixth novel and was published in 1926. It was the third novel that featured the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Like many of her other novels, the book is set in a small town and focuses on the interactions between characters who are well known to one another.

When the novel was first published, critical reactions were mixed because of the unusual narrative structure. Christie chose to have the murderer tell the story from his point of view. This device caused some consternation because some believed that Christie was not “playing fair” with her readers. They reasoned that, in crime fiction, if the novel is to be fair, the reader should be able to follow the same path the detective does in order to solve the crime. Some believed that by having the narrator as the murderer, the reader would not be able to follow the path of the clues, since the murderer would, in order to protect his identity, conceal certain key pieces of information.

Christie circumvents this problem in several ways. First, Dr. Sheppard is an extremely believable character. Because of the remorseful tone he assumes at the beginning of the novel, the reader immediately trusts him and his observations. In addition, Poirot appears to trust Sheppard, including him in discussions with the police and, as Poirot admits, using Sheppard as a substitute for Captain Hastings, who had played Dr. Watson to Poirot’s Sherlock Holmes in previous novels. Thus, the reader is led to trust Sheppard because Poirot trusts him.

Sheppard also establishes an intimate rapport with the reader through the use of first-person narrative. The reader is privy to what are assumed to be the doctor’s private thoughts about Ackroyd’s murder. Poirot also confides in Sheppard and often asks his opinion of people within the town. Again, this action on the part of Christie serves to inspire confidence in the narrator; the reader does not suspect him because Poirot does not, and because Christie has, as in previous novels, established Poirot as a reliable source and a good judge of human nature.

Another aspect to the novel in regard to the narration is the comparatively small role that Poirot plays. The reader is accustomed to seeing him as the main character—almost as a master puppeteer who guides the movements of all around him. In fact, the readers expect Poirot to manipulate them, for this is the nature of crime fiction in general: The reader is manipulated by the detective to see things his or her way. Christie, however, chooses to radically depart from this formula. Instead of Poirot manipulating the reader, Sheppard manipulates both the reader and Poirot. The reader is unaware of this subterfuge, however, until the end of the novel, when all the other probable suspects have been eliminated and only Sheppard remains. The reader is then privy to Sheppard’s confession, and all the pieces to this very complex puzzle fall into place.

We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.

What’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.

Now, in Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom—and even of hope itself.

With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.",Everything Is F*cked: A Book About Hope,Mark Manson, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780062955951,"1st Published,2019",274,India,English

Hema Malini wears many hats with admirable ease. No other industry name comes close to matching the breadth of her achievements.
In an industry where the male star has traditionally driven the commercial success of films, Hema was an exception, with her name alone sufficing to ensure a film's, box-office glory. She was, arguably. India's first female superstar. Apart from starring in mainstream super-hits like Johny Mera Naam, Jugnu, Andaz, Seeta aur Geeta, Sholay and, more recently, Baghban, she received critical acclaim for her performances in Lal Patthar, Khushboo, Kinara, Meera, Ek Chadar Maili Si and Razia Sultan. But, even as she completes fifty years in cinema, there is much more to her than just her Bollywood journey.
From her efforts at reviving and sustaining classical dance to her graceful handling of her personal life and the controversies that have plagued her in her political avatar, from her relationships to her religious beliefs and her recent tryst with singing, Hema Malini: Beyond the Dream Girl covers it all.

Soon after arriving at his hotel in Istanbul, private investigator Hercule Poirot is instructed to return to London immediately. He boards the Orient Express that very night and is accosted by Mr. Ratchett, whom he had earlier seen in his hotel in Istanbul. He attempts to hire Poirot believing that his life is under threat, but the detective refuses him outright.

On the second night of the journey, a snowdrift brings the train to a halt. A cry from Ratchett’s coach pierces the eerie silence of the night. The next morning, M. Bouc, the director of the company that operates the train and an acquaintance of Poirot, informs him of the shocking murder of Ratchett. Upon his request, Poirot agrees to investigate the case. Soon Poirot learns of Ratchett’s questionable past and the probable reasons for his murder.

In the United States a few years earlier, Daisy Armstrong, a 3 year old heiress was kidnapped and killed by a man, who went by the name Cassetti, in spite of collecting a ransom from her wealthy family. Suspected to have rigged the trial, Cassetti fled the country after his acquittal. Poirot came to the conclusion that Ratchett was none other than Cassetti.

What connects the people in Ratchett’s coach who were travelling with him on that fateful night of the murder? Is one of the members of the Armstrong family the murderer?

Murder on the Orient Express has been adapted to TV, film and radio as well. The book was first published in 1934.

#1 New York Times Bestseller!

In the second book of the Carve the Mark duology, globally bestselling Divergent author Veronica Roth reveals how Cyra and Akos fulfill their fates. The Fates Divide is a richly imagined tale of hope and resilience told in four stunning perspectives.

The lives of Cyra Noavek and Akos Kereseth are ruled by their fates, spoken by the oracles at their births. The fates, once determined, are inescapable.

Akos is in love with Cyra, in spite of his fate: He will die in service to Cyra’s family. And when Cyra’s father, Lazmet Noavek—a soulless tyrant, thought to be dead—reclaims the Shotet throne, Akos believes his end is closer than ever.

As Lazmet ignites a barbaric war, Cyra and Akos are desperate to stop him at any cost. For Cyra, that could mean taking the life of the man who may—or may not—be her father. For Akos, it could mean giving his own. In a stunning twist, the two will discover how fate defines their lives in ways most unexpected.

The Fifth Mountain is set in the year 870 BC. Israel is being ruled by Phoenicians and Queen Jezebel wants to ensure that the people follow her own faith, one she brought from her native land. So, she orders the death of all those who do not bow down to her God, Baal.

One of these rebels is the Prophet Elijah. The Queen orders his death for refusing to obey her. Elijah flees to the lovely Phoenician city of Zarephath, which is also known by the Phoenician name of Akbar. This place was actually considered to be the abode of the God, though Elijah refused to acknowledge it.

There he meets a woman who is a worshipper of Baal. Though their religious views differ and she is older than him, Elijah and the woman are attracted to each other. But they don't discuss their feelings openly. Meanwhile, Elijah, who has been sent to this place by an angel, wants to rid Israel of the tyranny of Queen Jezebel.

But due to a surprising turn of events, the people of Akbar accept him as a sage. They consider him one of their own and come to him for advice and to settle disputes. As Elijah begins to bond with these people, he suffers from conflicting ambitions. He cannot decide whether to remain in Akbar, his adopted city, or to return to Israel. Subsequently, the destructive Assyrian invasion on Akbar worsens Elijah’s dilemma.
In The Fifth Mountain, through the context of a religious tale, the author conveys the importance of finding one's own destiny, even if it seems like it will involve rebelling against God's will. He insists that in doing so, one will find oneself getting closer to God.

Cards on the Table is a detective novel by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 2 November 1936 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence and the US edition at $2.00.

The book features the recurring characters of Hercule Poirot, Colonel Race, Superintendent Battle and the bumbling crime writer Ariadne Oliver, making her first appearance in a Poirot novel. The four detectives and four possible suspects play bridge after dinner with Mr Shaitana. At the end of the evening, Mr Shaitana is discovered murdered. Identifying the murderer, per Mrs Christie, depends wholly on discerning the psychology of the suspects.

This novel was well received at first printing and in later reviews. It was noted for its humour, for the subtlety of the writing, good clueing and tight writing, showing continuing improvement in the author's writing style in this, her twentieth novel. One later reviewer considered this in the top rung of her novels, and another found it to be most original, with a brilliant surprise ending.

In this compilation of eight marvellous short stories, Agatha Christie delights readers with the presence of her three male sleuths in six respective stories. Two stories each for Parker Pyne, the duo Harley Quin-Satterthwaite and Hercule Poirot ‘the police hound.’ In the two other, two women on a crossroads of their life are faced with difficult decision to make.

Presumably first appeared in the UK magazines, seven of them were written in the twenties and in the  thirties. Only The Harlequin Tea Set was in 1971. Interestingly, the copyright of five of them were signed as Mrs. Mallowan; hence after her divorce in 1928.

Poirot’s cases concern with a reconstruction of a suicide and the death of an old eccentric well-to-do man who summons the Belgian to his home. In the former story, it starts when he receives a telephone call from a mysterious woman begging for his help. ‘…table with yellow irises,’ she sounds frightened  of being overheard. In the latter, a shot is heard moments after the first gong for dinner but a guest firmly believes of having heard the second gong. Four years later the same plot appears in Dead Man’s Mirror (see Notes On The Murder In The Mews) with alterations to the character names.

In the non-detective stories, two female protagonists must make her choice. On the one hand, it is between a dog or starvation in Next To A Dog; the dog being the very memory of a dead husband. On the other, Theodora Darrel undergoes a battle of will between loyalty vs happiness. Will she still walk out from her marriage having known that her husband has been in a serious charge of theft and fraud?
The Love Detectives (1926) seems to mark the early appearance of Harley Quin; an enigmatic man of whom his path is crossed with Mr. Satterthwaite’s on a number of occasions (see Notes On The Mysterious Mr. Quin). In a dark night both meets when their car collide; Sattwerthwaite is with Colonel Melrose on their way to a crime scene. An aristocrat has been killed with a bronze figure of Venus. Then his beautiful wife and a male guest whom stays over in the house confess of the murder. Who is one to believe?

Any readers who remember Mrs. Protheroe and Lawrence Redding     will understand what  occurs next in the story (see Notes On The Murder At The Vicarage).

As the book begins, Athena is dead. How she ended up that way creates the intrigue sustaining the book. The child, Sherine Khalil renames herself Athena after her uncle was discussing with her mother on how her real name will betray her origins and something like Athena gave nothing away. As a child, she shows a strong religious vocation and reports seeing angels and saints, which both impresses and worries her parents.

She goes into a London University to pursue Engineering at the age of 19 but it's not what her heart wanted. One day she just decides that she wanted to drop out of college, get married and have a baby. Here, the author mentions that this might be due to the fact that she was abandoned herself and wants to give all that love she could to her child which she didn't receive from her birth mother. Two years later, her marriage falls apart because they are facing too many problems due to their young age and lack of money or mostly because he felt that she loved only the child and used him to get what she wanted. A very interesting quote she uses is ""From Ancient Greece on, the people who returned from battle were either dead on their shields or stronger, despite or because of their scars. It's better that way: I've lived on a battlefield since I was born, but I'm still alive and I don't need anyone to protect me."" She grows into a woman in search of answers to many questions that arise within a person. She had a life which many felt was content because she had a child of her own, money, and friends; everything but her mind was at peace, so she searches for the answer to the classical question of ""Who am I?"" through many experiences.

While Ashoke Ganguli is studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the young wife is lost in the alien land with not many around to help her and no friends she could talk to and hang out with. Now, their young boy has to be named by an elder person in the family, as a part of the tradition followed in Bengali families. This honour has been given to Ashima’s grandmother. Due to circumstances, the couple find out that they cannot leave the hospital without naming the child. Ashoke thus chooses the name of his favourite Russian author, Gogol, for time being. But when Ashima’s grandmother passes away before picking a name for her great grandson, the boy remains Gogol. Although he likes his name initially, he starts to dislike it by the time he begins going to high school. And he formally changes his name to Nikhil before leaving for higher studies, and becomes Nikhil Gogol Ganguli. Ashima is extremely unhappy with her son when he starts becoming more of an American, and Ashoke remains quiet about all this until he finds the right time to tell Gogol why he chose that name. The reason behind a name is what constitutes the soul of the story, which changes the young man forever.

Maurice Willson Disher's review in The Times Literary Supplement of 16 January 1943 concluded, ""No crime enthusiast will object that the story of how the painter died has to be told many times, for this, even if it creates an interest which is more problem than plot, demonstrates the author's uncanny skill. The answer to the riddle is brilliant.""

Maurice Richardson was pleased to see the return of Poirot to Christie's works when he reviewed the novel in the 10 January 1943 issue of The Observer. He concluded, ""Despite only five suspects, Mrs. Christie, as usual, puts a ring through the reader's nose and leads him to one of her smashing last-minute showdowns. This is well up to the standard of her middle Poirot period. No more need be said.""

J.D. Beresford in The Guardian's 20 January 1943 review, wrote: ""Miss Agatha Christie never fails us, and her Five Little Pigs presents a very pretty problem for the ingenious reader."" It concluded that the clue to who committed the crime was, ""completely satisfying.""

Robert Barnard: ""The-murder-in-the-past plot on its first and best appearance – accept no later substitutes. Presentation more intricate than usual, characterization more subtle."" All in all, it is a beautifully tailored book, rich and satisfying. The present writer would be willing to chance his arm and say that this is the best Christie of all.""

																																										Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain.

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end.

A novel rich in metaphors and symbolism, The Alchemist is a story based on the adventures of a young shepherd boy, who, upon deciding to follow his prophetic dreams, sets on a treasure hunt. This journey introduces him to some remarkable people who leave an indelible and profound mark on him.  

Summary Of The Book: 
The Alchemist was first published in 1988. The protagonist of the story, a young Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago, is plagued with recurring dreams, wherein a mysterious child urges him to look for buried treasure at the base of the Egyptian pyramids. Determined, he leaves Spain and heads towards Egypt. En route, he meets the King of Salem, a man named Melchizedek. Melchizedek introduces Santiago to the concept of a ‘Personal Legend’ or a personal map or a quest that guides him to what his heart truly desires.
While attempting to cross the Sahara desert on the way to Egypt, he joins a caravan which is driven by an Englishman who is aspiring to be an alchemist. During a stop over in Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets Fatima, a young girl of exceeding beauty who steals his heart. He asks her to marry him, but she declines saying that she will do so only once he has found the treasure he seeks. In the Saharan oasis of Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets a 200 year old alchemist who decides to accompany him on his expedition. He imparts wisdom and valuable knowledge to Santiago, who eventually understands why the supposed treasure keeps evading him.
Having sold over 65 million copies worldwide, The Alchemist is marked by its profound simplicity, the easy flow of the story, and the poignant moral it tries to teach the reader, that worldly possessions and extravagance are immaterial when compared to finding your own ‘Personal Legend’.",The Alchemist (About 150 Million Copies Sold),Paulo Coelho, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9788172234980,"1st Edition,2015",192,Abroad,English

Currently ranked World No. 1 in women's doubles, Sania Mirza became an instant sensation when she won the Wimbledon Championships girls' doubles title at the age of sixteen. From 2003 until her retirement from the singles circuit in 2012, she was ranked by the Women's Tennis Association as India's top player, both in singles and doubles. A six-time Grand Slam champion, she notched up an incredible forty-one consecutive wins with her doubles partner, Martina Hingis, between August 2015 and February 2016.

Ace against Odds is the story of this most iconic Indian player who beat incredible odds to get to the top of her sport. Sania writes with candour of the hardships along the way, of the physical and emotional trauma caused by injuries and medical procedures, of the friends and partners who became her mainstay along with her family, of the pressures of constant public scrutiny and, not least, the politics and heartbreaks that inevitably accompany success.

Sania broke the rules, she spoke her mind, she pushed herself to the limit, she played for India fiercely and without care for how it might impact her rankings - she is and will continue to remain an inspiration long after she steps off the tennis courts.(goodreads.com)",Ace Against Odds,Sania Mirza, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789351362630,"1st Edition,2016",288,India,English

Looking For Alaska, John Green’s debut novel was first published in 2005. Looking For Alaska follows the life of Miles Halter, as he leaves Florida to join boarding school in Alabama. He joins Culver Creek, the boarding school, later than usual, as he himself mentions that he is looking for a “Great Perhaps”.

Among his quirks include memorizing the last words of famous people and the “Great Perhaps” was that of Francois Rabelais. Miles receives the nickname Pudge in school, and though his was a figure that was nothing like the name entailed, it stuck.

His roommate and friend is Chip, who is the person who introduces him to Alaska Young, the Alaska mentioned in the title of the story. The adventures that they are involved in together cause him to fall in love with Alaska, and the entire book is written in first person. Most of the book is written as a countdown to a specific occurrence, which occurs in the rest of the book and it is easy to gather from the title, what this section would cover.

Though mostly mature and insightful, readers often get a peek into the sex addled mind of a sixteen year old school student, one who is forever counting the number of layers of clothing separating him from the bare body of the girl he is presently with.

Looking For Alaska won the 2006 Michael L. Printz Award from the American Library Association. It broke into the New York Times Bestseller list at number 10 in 2012, much after its debut in 2005. The film rights to the book have been sold to Paramount Pictures, though the project hasn’t been greenlighted yet due to lack of sufficient interest.

Hercule Poirot finds himself the uninvited guest at the scene of an elaborately planned murder on wheels. The Belgian detective is making his way from Istanbul, Turkey, to London, and he is looking forward to a leisurely trip and a chance to clear his head, a chance to rest his “little grey cells,” as Poirot refers to his brain.

A good friend of Poirot, M. Bouc, is an administrator with Wagon Lit, the train company that operates the Orient Express. Poirot prefers to travel first class. Because it is winter, off season for tourists, the detective is assured by Bouc that finding a first-class cabin on the train will be easy. To their surprise, the car leaving Istanbul, the Calais Coach, is nearly full. There is, however, one no-show, and Poirot finds himself sharing a compartment with Hector MacQueen, the private secretary to a wealthy American, Mr. Ratchett.

Poirot is introduced by Bouc to Dr. Constantine, a Greek physician, traveling in the next car. On the first night of the journey, as they sit in the dining car, Bouc points out to Poirot the variety of travelers in the dining car: the rich and the poor. Some are English, some American, some French, some Italian, some Russian, some Hungarian—an array of passengers from differing socioeconomic backgrounds and different cultures. Where else in the world, Bouc wonders aloud, could one find such an assortment of people beneath one roof? Yes, Poirot thinks to himself, perhaps only in America.

The first night passes peacefully, and Bouc moves Poirot from his shared cabin with MacQueen to a private one next door to Ratchett. During the second night of the trip, Poirot has trouble sleeping, awakened by voices, service bells summoning conductor Pierre Michel, and thumping on his cabin door. At about 1:15 a.m., Poirot sticks his head out of his cabin and sees a woman wearing a kimono with a dragon print walking down the corridor. He hears his neighbor, Ratchett, tell the conductor in perfect French that nothing is wrong and that he had not meant to ring his service bell. The train is stopped, too, as an avalanche of snow covers the tracks.

Ratchett, Poirot has determined, is an evil man. The evil shows on his face, and Poirot has taken an instant dislike in him. Earlier in the evening, Poirot had been approached by Ratchett and was offered a job—to keep Ratchett alive. Ratchett has been receiving hate mail and otherwise threatening letters.

This book, Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges, takes up the story from when A.P.J Abdul Kalam became the President of India. It covers his acceptance of the post of the President of India, his term in office, his efforts to make his term meaningful, and the challenges he faced.

His term from 2002 to 2007 was an eventful one. The President of India is just a titular head with minimal powers. But, the office is one of great influence and Kalam used it to best effect. He got the government and the public to focus on issues that were relevant to the country's all round growth.

He initiated programs like PURA to try and integrate rural areas into the general economic and technological growth of the country. He dreamt of taking the whole of India on his vision for the country in the new millennium, and he saw no reason why the villages should be left out in this vision.

Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges is more about Kalam’s vision for his country rather than about himself. He tries to provide a blueprint for development, and for reforms in the government and judiciary.

Dr.Kalam is a strong advocate for the use of technology and a proponent of e-governance. Even the little bits of personal experience during his term that he gives, he links with these ideas. For instance, he mentions the controversial dissolution of the Bihar assembly for which he later offered to resign. But, he does not focus on the political or personal implications of this decision, instead, he chose to highlight his use of electronic communication in lending his approval to this move, for he was in Moscow at that time.

He made the office of the President accessible to the public. He used his popularity and high visibility to inspire the youth of the country and convince them to believe in his 2020 vision for India. He urged the young people to dream big, and to believe in their country's destiny. Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges describes the term in office of one of the most charismatic Presidents of the country.

Winning, published in 2010, is a self-help management guide to help readers find answers to some of the most difficult questions of their professional lives. Winning starts off with an introduction, where Jack Welch says that the most commonly asked question is, What does it take to win?

The first part of the book, Underneath It All, describes Jack’s management philosophy. The author says that an organization should take ideas from every level, and not just the top leaders.

Winning also says that maintaining a good work-life balance is essential. The last part, Tying Up Loose Ends, answers nine questions that do not fall in the above categories, like managing the China threat.

Winning is filled with personal stories and experiences, and has been written with a no-nonsense attitude. This book offers no easy solutions on how to win, as there really are none.

Balram Halwai narrates his life in a letter, written in seven consecutive nights and addressed to the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao. In his letter, Balram explains how he, the son of a puller, escaped a life of servitude to become a successful businessman, describing himself as an entrepreneur.

Balram was born in the rural village of Laxmangarh, where he lived with his grandmother, parents, brother and extended family. He is a smart child but is forced to leave school in order to help pay for his cousin's dowry and begins to work in a teashop with his brother in Dhanbad. While working there he begins to learn about India's government and economy from the customers' conversations. Balram describes himself as a bad servant but a good listener and decides to become a driver.

After learning how to drive, Balram finds a job driving Ashok, the son of one of Laxmangarh's landlords. He takes over the job of the main driver, from a small car to a heavy-luxury described Honda City. He stops sending money back to his family and disrespects his grandmother during a trip back to his village. Balram moves to New Delhi with Ashok and his wife Pinky Madam. Throughout their time in Delhi, Balram is exposed to extensive corruption, especially in the government. In Delhi, the contrast between the poor and the wealthy is made even more evident by their proximity to one another.

One night Pinky Madam takes the wheel from Balram, while drunk, hits something in the road and drives away; we are left to assume that she has killed a child. Ashok's family puts pressure on Balram to confess that he had been driving alone. Ashok becomes increasingly involved in bribing government officials for the benefit of the family coal business. Balram then decides that killing Ashok will be the only way to escape India's Rooster Coop. After bludgeoning Ashok with a bottle and stealing a large bribe, Balram moves to Bangalore, where he bribes the police in order to help start his own taxi business. Ashok too is portrayed to be trapped in the metaphorical Rooster Coop: his family controls what he does and society dictates how he acts. Just like Ashok, Balram pays off a family whose son one of his taxi drivers hit and killed. Balram explains that his own family was almost certainly killed by Ashok's relatives as retribution for his murder. At the end of the novel, Balram rationalizes his actions and considers that his freedom is worth the lives of his family and of Ashok. And thus ends the letter to Jiabao, letting the reader think of the dark humour of the tale, as well as the idea of life as a trap introduced by the writer.(wiki)",The White Tiger,Aravind Adiga, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789352645060,"Reprinted,2017",324,India,English

Pointing to the horizon where the sea and sky are joined, he says, ‘It is only an illusion because they can’t really meet, but isn’t it beautiful, this union which isn’t really there.’ – SAADAT HASAN MANTO Sometime in 2016, a series of dialogues took place which set out to find a meeting ground, even if only an illusion, between A.S. Dulat and Asad Durrani. One was a former chief of RAW, India’s external intelligence agency, the other of ISI, its Pakistani counterpart. As they could not meet in their home countries, the conversations, guided by journalist Aditya Sinha, took place in cities like Istanbul, Bangkok and Kathmandu. On the table were subjects that have long haunted South Asia, flashpoints that take lives regularly. It was in all ways a deep dive into the politics of the subcontinent, as seen through the eyes of two spymasters. Among the subjects: Kashmir, and a missed opportunity for peace; Hafiz Saeed and 26/11; Kulbhushan Jadhav; surgical strikes; the deal for Osama bin Laden; how the US and Russia feature in the India-Pakistan relationship; and how terror undermines the two countries’ attempts at talks. When the project was first mooted, General Durrani laughed and said nobody would believe it even if it was written as fiction. At a time of fraught relations, this unlikely dialogue between two former spy chiefs from opposite sides-a project that is the first of its kind-may well provide some answers.

How is it, then, that today the former British colonial trading post is a thriving Asian metropolis with not only the world's number one airline, best airport, and busiest port of trade, but also the world's fourth–highest per capita real income?

The story of that transformation is told here by Singapore's charismatic, controversial founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. Rising from a legacy of divisive colonialism, the devastation of the Second World War, and general poverty and disorder following the withdrawal of foreign forces, Singapore now is hailed as a city of the future. This miraculous history is dramatically recounted by the man who not only lived through it all but who fearlessly forged ahead and brought about most of these changes.

Delving deep into his own meticulous notes, as well as previously unpublished government papers and official records, Lee details the extraordinary efforts it took for an island city–state in Southeast Asia to survive at that time.

Lee explains how he and his cabinet colleagues finished off the communist threat to the fledgling state's security and began the arduous process of nation building: forging basic infrastructural roads through a land that still consisted primarily of swamps, creating an army from a hitherto racially and ideologically divided population, stamping out the last vestiges of colonial–era corruption, providing mass public housing, and establishing a national airline and airport.

In this illuminating account, Lee writes frankly about his trenchant approach to political opponents and his often unorthodox views on human rights, democracy, and inherited intelligence, aiming always ""to be correct, not politically correct."" Nothing in Singapore escaped his watchful eye: whether choosing shrubs for the greening of the country, restoring the romance of the historic Raffles Hotel, or openly, unabashedly persuading young men to marry women as well educated as themselves. Today's safe, tidy Singapore bears Lee's unmistakable stamp, for which he is unapologetic: ""If this is a nanny state, I am proud to have fostered one.""

Though Lee's domestic canvas in Singapore was small, his vigor and talent assured him a larger place in world affairs. With inimitable style, he brings history to life with cogent analyses of some of the greatest strategic issues of recent times and reveals how, over the years, he navigated the shifting tides of relations among America, China, and Taiwan, acting as confidant, sounding board, and messenger for them. He also includes candid, sometimes acerbic pen portraits of his political peers, including the indomitable Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, the poetry–spouting Jiang Zemin, and ideologues George Bush and Deng Xiaoping.

Lee also lifts the veil on his family life and writes tenderly of his wife and stalwart partner, Kwa Geok Choo, and of their pride in their three children –– particularly the eldest son, Hsien Loong, who is now Singapore's deputy prime minister.

For more than three decades, Lee Kuan Yew has been praised and vilified in equal measure, and he has established himself as a force impossible to ignore in Asian and international politics. From Third World to First offers readers a compelling glimpse into this visionary's heart, soul, and mind.",From Third World to First,Lee Kuan Yew, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780060197766,1st Edition,752,Abroad,English

Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain. 

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end. 
This novel has been greatly appreciated by its readers, being labeled as the most important book of the 20th century by the Children’s Books Of The Century poll, published in Books For Keeps. Although the exact number is not known, there have been 35-100 million copies of The Hobbit sold, till date, since it’s publishing in the year 1937. The Hobbit has also been adapted into a movie, whose first part, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey released in the United States on the 14th of December 2012. This movie was directed by Peter Jackson, and the second, and third parts are scheduled to release in 2013, and 2014.

A prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity set in the Sundarbans, an immense labyrinth of tiny islands on the easternmost coast of India.

The Hungry Tide is a very contemporary story of adventure and unlikely love, identity and history, set in one of the most fascinating regions on the earth. Off the easternmost coast of India, in the Bay of Bengal, lies the immense labyrinth of tiny islands known as the Sundarbans. 

For settlers here, life is extremely precarious. Attacks by deadly tigers are common. Unrest and eviction are constant threats. Without warning, at any time, tidal floods rise and surge over the land, leaving devastation in their wake. In this place of vengeful beauty, the lives of three people from different worlds collide. Piya Roy is a young marine biologist, of Indian descent but stubbornly American, in search of a rare, endangered river dolphin. 

Her journey begins with a disaster, when she is thrown from a boat into crocodile-infested waters. Rescue comes in the form of a young, illiterate fisherman, Fokir. Although they have no language between them, Piya and Fokir are powerfully drawn to each other, sharing an uncanny instinct for the ways of the sea. Piya engages Fokir to help with her research and finds a translator in Kanai Dutt, a businessman from Delhi whose idealistic aunt and uncle are longtime settlers in the Sundarbans. 

As the three of them launch into the elaborate backwaters, they are drawn unawares into the hidden undercurrents of this isolated world, where political turmoil exacts a personal toll that is every bit as powerful as the ravaging tide. Already an international success, The Hungry Tide is a prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity.",The Hungry Tide,Amitav Ghosh, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780007432974,"1st Edition,2004",403,Abroad,English

Sidney Sheldon’s Tell Me Your Dreams introduces three very different women at the onset of the novel. Introduced first is Ashley Peterson, a beautiful young woman who works for a computer company in Silicon Valley. Ashley is single and convinced she is being stalked. Readers next meet Ashley’s co-workers, Toni and Alette. Toni Prescott, a British woman in her early twenties is rather bold and striking. Rounding out the trio is Alette Peters, a quiet, dreamy romantic who moved to California from Rome. In the early stages of the novel, quite a few murders are committed and police in Chicago, San Francisco, and Quebec are desperate to solve the gruesome crimes that have taken place in each of their cities. Conclusive evidence points to one suspect and one suspect alone.

As the story develops, the reader learns why Ashley feels so alone in the world. She is the only child of a world-famous heart surgeon, who is often critical and overbearing. Although Ashley loves her father, she does not necessarily love his company and tries to avoid him. Toni is a provocateur with a penchant for song who suffered a strained relationship with her mother. Alette is a gifted artist who lacks self-confidence. As the novel draws to a conclusion, Ashley, Toni, and Alette are proven to be one in the same.

The reader will not be disappointed with Sheldon’s storytelling upon finishing this book. Sheldon provides a fascinating and precise examination of the different aspects of multiple personality disorder through the characters of Ashley, Toni, and Alette. He expertly draws the reader into his story, just as a fly is drawn into a spider’s web. Although this novel was a great effort, it is not one of Sheldon’s best—as portions of the plot are predictable. Sheldon’s ending, however, does have some panache.

The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd,আগাথা ক্রিস্টি,"",TK. 538,https://rokomari.com//book/129560/the-murder-of-roger-ackroyd,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/5db93ac69_129560.jpg,"'The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd' Summary of the book
The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was Christie’s sixth novel and was published in 1926. It was the third novel that featured the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Like many of her other novels, the book is set in a small town and focuses on the interactions between characters who are well known to one another.

When the novel was first published, critical reactions were mixed because of the unusual narrative structure. Christie chose to have the murderer tell the story from his point of view. This device caused some consternation because some believed that Christie was not “playing fair” with her readers. They reasoned that, in crime fiction, if the novel is to be fair, the reader should be able to follow the same path the detective does in order to solve the crime. Some believed that by having the narrator as the murderer, the reader would not be able to follow the path of the clues, since the murderer would, in order to protect his identity, conceal certain key pieces of information.

Christie circumvents this problem in several ways. First, Dr. Sheppard is an extremely believable character. Because of the remorseful tone he assumes at the beginning of the novel, the reader immediately trusts him and his observations. In addition, Poirot appears to trust Sheppard, including him in discussions with the police and, as Poirot admits, using Sheppard as a substitute for Captain Hastings, who had played Dr. Watson to Poirot’s Sherlock Holmes in previous novels. Thus, the reader is led to trust Sheppard because Poirot trusts him.

Sheppard also establishes an intimate rapport with the reader through the use of first-person narrative. The reader is privy to what are assumed to be the doctor’s private thoughts about Ackroyd’s murder. Poirot also confides in Sheppard and often asks his opinion of people within the town. Again, this action on the part of Christie serves to inspire confidence in the narrator; the reader does not suspect him because Poirot does not, and because Christie has, as in previous novels, established Poirot as a reliable source and a good judge of human nature.

Another aspect to the novel in regard to the narration is the comparatively small role that Poirot plays. The reader is accustomed to seeing him as the main character—almost as a master puppeteer who guides the movements of all around him. In fact, the readers expect Poirot to manipulate them, for this is the nature of crime fiction in general: The reader is manipulated by the detective to see things his or her way. Christie, however, chooses to radically depart from this formula. Instead of Poirot manipulating the reader, Sheppard manipulates both the reader and Poirot. The reader is unaware of this subterfuge, however, until the end of the novel, when all the other probable suspects have been eliminated and only Sheppard remains. The reader is then privy to Sheppard’s confession, and all the pieces to this very complex puzzle fall into place.

We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.

What’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.

Now, in Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom—and even of hope itself.

With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.",Everything Is F*cked: A Book About Hope,Mark Manson, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780062955951,"1st Published,2019",274,India,English

Soon after arriving at his hotel in Istanbul, private investigator Hercule Poirot is instructed to return to London immediately. He boards the Orient Express that very night and is accosted by Mr. Ratchett, whom he had earlier seen in his hotel in Istanbul. He attempts to hire Poirot believing that his life is under threat, but the detective refuses him outright.

On the second night of the journey, a snowdrift brings the train to a halt. A cry from Ratchett’s coach pierces the eerie silence of the night. The next morning, M. Bouc, the director of the company that operates the train and an acquaintance of Poirot, informs him of the shocking murder of Ratchett. Upon his request, Poirot agrees to investigate the case. Soon Poirot learns of Ratchett’s questionable past and the probable reasons for his murder.

In the United States a few years earlier, Daisy Armstrong, a 3 year old heiress was kidnapped and killed by a man, who went by the name Cassetti, in spite of collecting a ransom from her wealthy family. Suspected to have rigged the trial, Cassetti fled the country after his acquittal. Poirot came to the conclusion that Ratchett was none other than Cassetti.

What connects the people in Ratchett’s coach who were travelling with him on that fateful night of the murder? Is one of the members of the Armstrong family the murderer?

Murder on the Orient Express has been adapted to TV, film and radio as well. The book was first published in 1934.

About Agatha Christie

Agatha Christie was a crime novelist and short story writer, who also wrote plays.

Among the many novels that she has written are best-sellers like Hickory Dickory Dock, Cat Among The Pigeons, By The Pricking Of My Thumbs, Curtain, Sleeping Murder, While the Light Lasts and Other Stories, Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories, and The Regatta Mystery and Other Stories.

Agatha Christie is considered to be the best writer of crime fiction and murder mysteries till date. Her writing reflects strongly of her love of the mysterious and mystical with ceremonies and religious sects playing a large role in the settings of her plots. She has also been inspired to a great extent by the time she spent in archaeological field seasons in the Middle East as a result of which some of her writing includes extreme details of temples and excavation sites.

Agatha Christie was born on 15 September, 1890, to a wealthy family in Torquay, Devon. Prior to marrying and starting a family in London, she served in a hospital at the time of the World War I. She is listed on the Guinness Book of World Records as the best-selling novelist of all time. The publication of her first novel in 1920 featuring her most famous character Hercule Poirot kick started her writing career.

#1 New York Times Bestseller!

In the second book of the Carve the Mark duology, globally bestselling Divergent author Veronica Roth reveals how Cyra and Akos fulfill their fates. The Fates Divide is a richly imagined tale of hope and resilience told in four stunning perspectives.

The lives of Cyra Noavek and Akos Kereseth are ruled by their fates, spoken by the oracles at their births. The fates, once determined, are inescapable.

Akos is in love with Cyra, in spite of his fate: He will die in service to Cyra’s family. And when Cyra’s father, Lazmet Noavek—a soulless tyrant, thought to be dead—reclaims the Shotet throne, Akos believes his end is closer than ever.

As Lazmet ignites a barbaric war, Cyra and Akos are desperate to stop him at any cost. For Cyra, that could mean taking the life of the man who may—or may not—be her father. For Akos, it could mean giving his own. In a stunning twist, the two will discover how fate defines their lives in ways most unexpected.

The Fifth Mountain is set in the year 870 BC. Israel is being ruled by Phoenicians and Queen Jezebel wants to ensure that the people follow her own faith, one she brought from her native land. So, she orders the death of all those who do not bow down to her God, Baal.

One of these rebels is the Prophet Elijah. The Queen orders his death for refusing to obey her. Elijah flees to the lovely Phoenician city of Zarephath, which is also known by the Phoenician name of Akbar. This place was actually considered to be the abode of the God, though Elijah refused to acknowledge it.

There he meets a woman who is a worshipper of Baal. Though their religious views differ and she is older than him, Elijah and the woman are attracted to each other. But they don't discuss their feelings openly. Meanwhile, Elijah, who has been sent to this place by an angel, wants to rid Israel of the tyranny of Queen Jezebel.

But due to a surprising turn of events, the people of Akbar accept him as a sage. They consider him one of their own and come to him for advice and to settle disputes. As Elijah begins to bond with these people, he suffers from conflicting ambitions. He cannot decide whether to remain in Akbar, his adopted city, or to return to Israel. Subsequently, the destructive Assyrian invasion on Akbar worsens Elijah’s dilemma.
In The Fifth Mountain, through the context of a religious tale, the author conveys the importance of finding one's own destiny, even if it seems like it will involve rebelling against God's will. He insists that in doing so, one will find oneself getting closer to God.

Cards on the Table is a detective novel by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 2 November 1936 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence and the US edition at $2.00.

The book features the recurring characters of Hercule Poirot, Colonel Race, Superintendent Battle and the bumbling crime writer Ariadne Oliver, making her first appearance in a Poirot novel. The four detectives and four possible suspects play bridge after dinner with Mr Shaitana. At the end of the evening, Mr Shaitana is discovered murdered. Identifying the murderer, per Mrs Christie, depends wholly on discerning the psychology of the suspects.

This novel was well received at first printing and in later reviews. It was noted for its humour, for the subtlety of the writing, good clueing and tight writing, showing continuing improvement in the author's writing style in this, her twentieth novel. One later reviewer considered this in the top rung of her novels, and another found it to be most original, with a brilliant surprise ending.

In this compilation of eight marvellous short stories, Agatha Christie delights readers with the presence of her three male sleuths in six respective stories. Two stories each for Parker Pyne, the duo Harley Quin-Satterthwaite and Hercule Poirot ‘the police hound.’ In the two other, two women on a crossroads of their life are faced with difficult decision to make.


The map of Majorca, Spain where Parker Pyne has to resolve a rift between two women while on holiday.

Presumably first appeared in the UK magazines, seven of them were written in the twenties and in the  thirties. Only The Harlequin Tea Set was in 1971. Interestingly, the copyright of five of them were signed as Mrs. Mallowan; hence after her divorce in 1928.

Poirot’s cases concern with a reconstruction of a suicide and the death of an old eccentric well-to-do man who summons the Belgian to his home. In the former story, it starts when he receives a telephone call from a mysterious woman begging for his help. ‘…table with yellow irises,’ she sounds frightened  of being overheard. In the latter, a shot is heard moments after the first gong for dinner but a guest firmly believes of having heard the second gong. Four years later the same plot appears in Dead Man’s Mirror (see Notes On The Murder In The Mews) with alterations to the character names.

In the non-detective stories, two female protagonists must make her choice. On the one hand, it is between a dog or starvation in Next To A Dog; the dog being the very memory of a dead husband. On the other, Theodora Darrel undergoes a battle of will between loyalty vs happiness. Will she still walk out from her marriage having known that her husband has been in a serious charge of theft and fraud?
The Love Detectives (1926) seems to mark the early appearance of Harley Quin; an enigmatic man of whom his path is crossed with Mr. Satterthwaite’s on a number of occasions (see Notes On The Mysterious Mr. Quin). In a dark night both meets when their car collide; Sattwerthwaite is with Colonel Melrose on their way to a crime scene. An aristocrat has been killed with a bronze figure of Venus. Then his beautiful wife and a male guest whom stays over in the house confess of the murder. Who is one to believe?

Any readers who remember Mrs. Protheroe and Lawrence Redding     will understand what  occurs next in the story (see Notes On The Murder At The Vicarage).  The clock is changed to suit the alibi of a suspect and the study also becomes where the ‘thing’ happens. In Miss Marple’s case, however, the deceased’s wife and her

As the book begins, Athena is dead. How she ended up that way creates the intrigue sustaining the book. The child, Sherine Khalil renames herself Athena after her uncle was discussing with her mother on how her real name will betray her origins and something like Athena gave nothing away. As a child, she shows a strong religious vocation and reports seeing angels and saints, which both impresses and worries her parents.

She goes into a London University to pursue Engineering at the age of 19 but it's not what her heart wanted. One day she just decides that she wanted to drop out of college, get married and have a baby. Here, the author mentions that this might be due to the fact that she was abandoned herself and wants to give all that love she could to her child which she didn't receive from her birth mother. Two years later, her marriage falls apart because they are facing too many problems due to their young age and lack of money or mostly because he felt that she loved only the child and used him to get what she wanted. A very interesting quote she uses is ""From Ancient Greece on, the people who returned from battle were either dead on their shields or stronger, despite or because of their scars. It's better that way: I've lived on a battlefield since I was born, but I'm still alive and I don't need anyone to protect me."" She grows into a woman in search of answers to many questions that arise within a person. She had a life which many felt was content because she had a child of her own, money, and friends; everything but her mind was at peace, so she searches for the answer to the classical question of ""Who am I?"" through many experiences.

Ashoke Ganguli and Ashima Ganguli, a couple away from their home in Bengal, are about to have their first child in Massachusetts. While Ashoke Ganguli is studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the young wife is lost in the alien land with not many around to help her and no friends she could talk to and hang out with. Now, their young boy has to be named by an elder person in the family, as a part of the tradition followed in Bengali families. This honour has been given to Ashima’s grandmother. Due to circumstances, the couple find out that they cannot leave the hospital without naming the child. Ashoke thus chooses the name of his favourite Russian author, Gogol, for time being. But when Ashima’s grandmother passes away before picking a name for her great grandson, the boy remains Gogol. Although he likes his name initially, he starts to dislike it by the time he begins going to high school. And he formally changes his name to Nikhil before leaving for higher studies, and becomes Nikhil Gogol Ganguli. Ashima is extremely unhappy with her son when he starts becoming more of an American, and Ashoke remains quiet about all this until he finds the right time to tell Gogol why he chose that name. The reason behind a name is what constitutes the soul of the story, which changes the young man forever. This timeless story will certainly leave in thoughts that overwhelm you each time you recall it.

The answer to the riddle is brilliant.""

Maurice Richardson was pleased to see the return of Poirot to Christie's works when he reviewed the novel in the 10 January 1943 issue of The Observer. He concluded, ""Despite only five suspects, Mrs. Christie, as usual, puts a ring through the reader's nose and leads him to one of her smashing last-minute showdowns. This is well up to the standard of her middle Poirot period. No more need be said.""

J.D. Beresford in The Guardian's 20 January 1943 review, wrote: ""Miss Agatha Christie never fails us, and her Five Little Pigs presents a very pretty problem for the ingenious reader."" It concluded that the clue to who committed the crime was, ""completely satisfying.""

Robert Barnard: ""The-murder-in-the-past plot on its first and best appearance – accept no later substitutes. Presentation more intricate than usual, characterization more subtle.""

																																										Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain.

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end.

This novel has been greatly appreciated by its readers, being labeled as the most important book of the 20th century by the Children’s Books Of The Century poll, published in Books For Keeps. Although the exact number is not known, there have been 35-100 million copies of The Hobbit sold, till date, since it’s publishing in the year 1937.

A novel rich in metaphors and symbolism, The Alchemist is a story based on the adventures of a young shepherd boy, who, upon deciding to follow his prophetic dreams, sets on a treasure hunt. This journey introduces him to some remarkable people who leave an indelible and profound mark on him.  

Summary Of The Book: 
The Alchemist was first published in 1988. The protagonist of the story, a young Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago, is plagued with recurring dreams, wherein a mysterious child urges him to look for buried treasure at the base of the Egyptian pyramids. Determined, he leaves Spain and heads towards Egypt. En route, he meets the King of Salem, a man named Melchizedek. Melchizedek introduces Santiago to the concept of a ‘Personal Legend’ or a personal map or a quest that guides him to what his heart truly desires.
While attempting to cross the Sahara desert on the way to Egypt, he joins a caravan which is driven by an Englishman who is aspiring to be an alchemist. During a stop over in Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets Fatima, a young girl of exceeding beauty who steals his heart. He asks her to marry him, but she declines saying that she will do so only once he has found the treasure he seeks. In the Saharan oasis of Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets a 200 year old alchemist who decides to accompany him on his expedition. He imparts wisdom and valuable knowledge to Santiago, who eventually understands why the supposed treasure keeps evading him.
Having sold over 65 million copies worldwide, The Alchemist is marked by its profound simplicity, the easy flow of the story, and the poignant moral it tries to teach the reader, that worldly possessions and extravagance are immaterial when compared to finding your own ‘Personal Legend’.",The Alchemist (About 150 Million Copies Sold),Paulo Coelho, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9788172234980,"1st Edition,2015",192,Abroad,English

She moves to Geneva, Switzerland, aspiring to live the life of her dreams - a life filled with fame and fortune. Her dreams are shattered when she is introduced to the harsh realities of life.

One day, a chance encounter with an Arab man earns her a thousand francs for one night. Lured by the prospect of easy money, she ends up becoming a prostitute in a brothel in Geneva’s red-light district. Once there, she quickly learns the ropes and becomes quite successful, not to mention the envy of her colleagues. She shuts the door on love and only has time for the demands made by her body.

Her life is thrown into disarray when she meets a young Swiss painter named Ralf. She falls in love with Ralf, who is completely different from her. Her carnal feelings for Ralf and her true love for him vie for supremacy. She finally decides to move away from Geneva because she sees no future for them. But just before she leaves, she discovers the beautiful blend of sex and true love with Ralf.

Currently ranked World No. 1 in women's doubles, Sania Mirza became an instant sensation when she won the Wimbledon Championships girls' doubles title at the age of sixteen. From 2003 until her retirement from the singles circuit in 2012, she was ranked by the Women's Tennis Association as India's top player, both in singles and doubles. A six-time Grand Slam champion, she notched up an incredible forty-one consecutive wins with her doubles partner, Martina Hingis, between August 2015 and February 2016.

Ace against Odds is the story of this most iconic Indian player who beat incredible odds to get to the top of her sport. Sania writes with candour of the hardships along the way, of the physical and emotional trauma caused by injuries and medical procedures, of the friends and partners who became her mainstay along with her family, of the pressures of constant public scrutiny and, not least, the politics and heartbreaks that inevitably accompany success.

Sania broke the rules, she spoke her mind, she pushed herself to the limit, she played for India fiercely and without care for how it might impact her rankings - she is and will continue to remain an inspiration long after she steps off the tennis courts.(goodreads.com)",Ace Against Odds,Sania Mirza, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789351362630,"1st Edition,2016",288,India,English

Looking For Alaska, John Green’s debut novel was first published in 2005. Looking For Alaska follows the life of Miles Halter, as he leaves Florida to join boarding school in Alabama. He joins Culver Creek, the boarding school, later than usual, as he himself mentions that he is looking for a “Great Perhaps”.

Among his quirks include memorizing the last words of famous people and the “Great Perhaps” was that of Francois Rabelais. Miles receives the nickname Pudge in school, and though his was a figure that was nothing like the name entailed, it stuck.

His roommate and friend is Chip, who is the person who introduces him to Alaska Young, the Alaska mentioned in the title of the story. The adventures that they are involved in together cause him to fall in love with Alaska, and the entire book is written in first person. Most of the book is written as a countdown to a specific occurrence, which occurs in the rest of the book and it is easy to gather from the title, what this section would cover.

Though mostly mature and insightful, readers often get a peek into the sex addled mind of a sixteen year old school student, one who is forever counting the number of layers of clothing separating him from the bare body of the girl he is presently with.

Looking For Alaska won the 2006 Michael L. Printz Award from the American Library Association. It broke into the New York Times Bestseller list at number 10 in 2012, much after its debut in 2005. The film rights to the book have been sold to Paramount Pictures, though the project hasn’t been greenlighted yet due to lack of sufficient interest.

Hercule Poirot finds himself the uninvited guest at the scene of an elaborately planned murder on wheels. The Belgian detective is making his way from Istanbul, Turkey, to London, and he is looking forward to a leisurely trip and a chance to clear his head, a chance to rest his “little grey cells,” as Poirot refers to his brain.

A good friend of Poirot, M. Bouc, is an administrator with Wagon Lit, the train company that operates the Orient Express. Poirot prefers to travel first class. Because it is winter, off season for tourists, the detective is assured by Bouc that finding a first-class cabin on the train will be easy. To their surprise, the car leaving Istanbul, the Calais Coach, is nearly full. There is, however, one no-show, and Poirot finds himself sharing a compartment with Hector MacQueen, the private secretary to a wealthy American, Mr. Ratchett.

Poirot is introduced by Bouc to Dr. Constantine, a Greek physician, traveling in the next car. On the first night of the journey, as they sit in the dining car, Bouc points out to Poirot the variety of travelers in the dining car: the rich and the poor. Some are English, some American, some French, some Italian, some Russian, some Hungarian—an array of passengers from differing socioeconomic backgrounds and different cultures. Where else in the world, Bouc wonders aloud, could one find such an assortment of people beneath one roof? Yes, Poirot thinks to himself, perhaps only in America.

The first night passes peacefully, and Bouc moves Poirot from his shared cabin with MacQueen to a private one next door to Ratchett. During the second night of the trip, Poirot has trouble sleeping, awakened by voices, service bells summoning conductor Pierre Michel, and thumping on his cabin door. At about 1:15 a.m., Poirot sticks his head out of his cabin and sees a woman wearing a kimono with a dragon print walking down the corridor. He hears his neighbor, Ratchett, tell the conductor in perfect French that nothing is wrong and that he had not meant to ring his service bell. The train is stopped, too, as an avalanche of snow covers the tracks.

Ratchett, Poirot has determined, is an evil man. The evil shows on his face, and Poirot has taken an instant dislike in him. Earlier in the evening, Poirot had been approached by Ratchett and was offered a job—to keep Ratchett alive. Ratchett has been receiving hate mail and otherwise threatening letters.

This book, Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges, takes up the story from when A.P.J Abdul Kalam became the President of India. It covers his acceptance of the post of the President of India, his term in office, his efforts to make his term meaningful, and the challenges he faced.

His term from 2002 to 2007 was an eventful one. The President of India is just a titular head with minimal powers. But, the office is one of great influence and Kalam used it to best effect. He got the government and the public to focus on issues that were relevant to the country's all round growth.

He initiated programs like PURA to try and integrate rural areas into the general economic and technological growth of the country. He dreamt of taking the whole of India on his vision for the country in the new millennium, and he saw no reason why the villages should be left out in this vision.

Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges is more about Kalam’s vision for his country rather than about himself. He tries to provide a blueprint for development, and for reforms in the government and judiciary.

Dr.Kalam is a strong advocate for the use of technology and a proponent of e-governance. Even the little bits of personal experience during his term that he gives, he links with these ideas. For instance, he mentions the controversial dissolution of the Bihar assembly for which he later offered to resign. But, he does not focus on the political or personal implications of this decision, instead, he chose to highlight his use of electronic communication in lending his approval to this move, for he was in Moscow at that time.

He made the office of the President accessible to the public. He used his popularity and high visibility to inspire the youth of the country and convince them to believe in his 2020 vision for India. He urged the young people to dream big, and to believe in their country's destiny. Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges describes the term in office of one of the most charismatic Presidents of the country.

Winning, published in 2010, is a self-help management guide to help readers find answers to some of the most difficult questions of their professional lives. Winning starts off with an introduction, where Jack Welch says that the most commonly asked question is, What does it take to win?

The first part of the book, Underneath It All, describes Jack’s management philosophy. The author says that an organization should take ideas from every level, and not just the top leaders.

In Your Career, the authors encourage readers to find the right job, to understand what it takes to get promoted, and learn how to handle a bad boss. Winning also says that maintaining a good work-life balance is essential. The last part, Tying Up Loose Ends, answers nine questions that do not fall in the above categories, like managing the China threat.

Winning is filled with personal stories and experiences, and has been written with a no-nonsense attitude. This book offers no easy solutions on how to win, as there really are none. This guide was on the top of The Wall Street Journal bestseller list, and has also been on The New York Times' bestseller list.

Balram Halwai narrates his life in a letter, written in seven consecutive nights and addressed to the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao. In his letter, Balram explains how he, the son of a puller, escaped a life of servitude to become a successful businessman, describing himself as an entrepreneur.

Balram was born in the rural village of Laxmangarh, where he lived with his grandmother, parents, brother and extended family. He is a smart child but is forced to leave school in order to help pay for his cousin's dowry and begins to work in a teashop with his brother in Dhanbad. While working there he begins to learn about India's government and economy from the customers' conversations. Balram describes himself as a bad servant but a good listener and decides to become a driver.

After learning how to drive, Balram finds a job driving Ashok, the son of one of Laxmangarh's landlords. He takes over the job of the main driver, from a small car to a heavy-luxury described Honda City. He stops sending money back to his family and disrespects his grandmother during a trip back to his village. Balram moves to New Delhi with Ashok and his wife Pinky Madam. Throughout their time in Delhi, Balram is exposed to extensive corruption, especially in the government. In Delhi, the contrast between the poor and the wealthy is made even more evident by their proximity to one another.

One night Pinky Madam takes the wheel from Balram, while drunk, hits something in the road and drives away; we are left to assume that she has killed a child. Ashok's family puts pressure on Balram to confess that he had been driving alone. Ashok becomes increasingly involved in bribing government officials for the benefit of the family coal business. Balram then decides that killing Ashok will be the only way to escape India's Rooster Coop. After bludgeoning Ashok with a bottle and stealing a large bribe, Balram moves to Bangalore, where he bribes the police in order to help start his own taxi business. Ashok too is portrayed to be trapped in the metaphorical Rooster Coop: his family controls what he does and society dictates how he acts. Just like Ashok, Balram pays off a family whose son one of his taxi drivers hit and killed. Balram explains that his own family was almost certainly killed by Ashok's relatives as retribution for his murder. At the end of the novel, Balram rationalizes his actions and considers that his freedom is worth the lives of his family and of Ashok. And thus ends the letter to Jiabao, letting the reader think of the dark humour of the tale, as well as the idea of life as a trap introduced by the writer.(wiki)",The White Tiger,Aravind Adiga, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789352645060,"Reprinted,2017",324,India,English

Pointing to the horizon where the sea and sky are joined, he says, ‘It is only an illusion because they can’t really meet, but isn’t it beautiful, this union which isn’t really there.’ – SAADAT HASAN MANTO Sometime in 2016, a series of dialogues took place which set out to find a meeting ground, even if only an illusion, between A.S. Dulat and Asad Durrani. One was a former chief of RAW, India’s external intelligence agency, the other of ISI, its Pakistani counterpart. As they could not meet in their home countries, the conversations, guided by journalist Aditya Sinha, took place in cities like Istanbul, Bangkok and Kathmandu. On the table were subjects that have long haunted South Asia, flashpoints that take lives regularly. It was in all ways a deep dive into the politics of the subcontinent, as seen through the eyes of two spymasters. Among the subjects: Kashmir, and a missed opportunity for peace; Hafiz Saeed and 26/11; Kulbhushan Jadhav; surgical strikes; the deal for Osama bin Laden; how the US and Russia feature in the India-Pakistan relationship; and how terror undermines the two countries’ attempts at talks. When the project was first mooted, General Durrani laughed and said nobody would believe it even if it was written as fiction. At a time of fraught relations, this unlikely dialogue between two former spy chiefs from opposite sides-a project that is the first of its kind-may well provide some answers.

How is it, then, that today the former British colonial trading post is a thriving Asian metropolis with not only the world's number one airline, best airport, and busiest port of trade, but also the world's fourth–highest per capita real income?

The story of that transformation is told here by Singapore's charismatic, controversial founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. Rising from a legacy of divisive colonialism, the devastation of the Second World War, and general poverty and disorder following the withdrawal of foreign forces, Singapore now is hailed as a city of the future. This miraculous history is dramatically recounted by the man who not only lived through it all but who fearlessly forged ahead and brought about most of these changes.

Delving deep into his own meticulous notes, as well as previously unpublished government papers and official records, Lee details the extraordinary efforts it took for an island city–state in Southeast Asia to survive at that time.

Lee explains how he and his cabinet colleagues finished off the communist threat to the fledgling state's security and began the arduous process of nation building: forging basic infrastructural roads through a land that still consisted primarily of swamps, creating an army from a hitherto racially and ideologically divided population, stamping out the last vestiges of colonial–era corruption, providing mass public housing, and establishing a national airline and airport.

In this illuminating account, Lee writes frankly about his trenchant approach to political opponents and his often unorthodox views on human rights, democracy, and inherited intelligence, aiming always ""to be correct, not politically correct."" Nothing in Singapore escaped his watchful eye: whether choosing shrubs for the greening of the country, restoring the romance of the historic Raffles Hotel, or openly, unabashedly persuading young men to marry women as well educated as themselves. Today's safe, tidy Singapore bears Lee's unmistakable stamp, for which he is unapologetic: ""If this is a nanny state, I am proud to have fostered one.""

Though Lee's domestic canvas in Singapore was small, his vigor and talent assured him a larger place in world affairs. With inimitable style, he brings history to life with cogent analyses of some of the greatest strategic issues of recent times and reveals how, over the years, he navigated the shifting tides of relations among America, China, and Taiwan, acting as confidant, sounding board, and messenger for them. He also includes candid, sometimes acerbic pen portraits of his political peers, including the indomitable Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, the poetry–spouting Jiang Zemin, and ideologues George Bush and Deng Xiaoping.

Lee also lifts the veil on his family life and writes tenderly of his wife and stalwart partner, Kwa Geok Choo, and of their pride in their three children –– particularly the eldest son, Hsien Loong, who is now Singapore's deputy prime minister.

For more than three decades, Lee Kuan Yew has been praised and vilified in equal measure, and he has established himself as a force impossible to ignore in Asian and international politics. From Third World to First offers readers a compelling glimpse into this visionary's heart, soul, and mind.",From Third World to First,Lee Kuan Yew, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780060197766,1st Edition,752,Abroad,English

Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain. 

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end. 
This novel has been greatly appreciated by its readers, being labeled as the most important book of the 20th century by the Children’s Books Of The Century poll, published in Books For Keeps. Although the exact number is not known, there have been 35-100 million copies of The Hobbit sold, till date, since it’s publishing in the year 1937. The Hobbit has also been adapted into a movie, whose first part, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey released in the United States on the 14th of December 2012. This movie was directed by Peter Jackson, and the second, and third parts are scheduled to release in 2013, and 2014.

A prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity set in the Sundarbans, an immense labyrinth of tiny islands on the easternmost coast of India.

The Hungry Tide is a very contemporary story of adventure and unlikely love, identity and history, set in one of the most fascinating regions on the earth. Off the easternmost coast of India, in the Bay of Bengal, lies the immense labyrinth of tiny islands known as the Sundarbans. 

For settlers here, life is extremely precarious. Attacks by deadly tigers are common. Unrest and eviction are constant threats. Without warning, at any time, tidal floods rise and surge over the land, leaving devastation in their wake. In this place of vengeful beauty, the lives of three people from different worlds collide. Piya Roy is a young marine biologist, of Indian descent but stubbornly American, in search of a rare, endangered river dolphin. 

Her journey begins with a disaster, when she is thrown from a boat into crocodile-infested waters. Rescue comes in the form of a young, illiterate fisherman, Fokir. Although they have no language between them, Piya and Fokir are powerfully drawn to each other, sharing an uncanny instinct for the ways of the sea. Piya engages Fokir to help with her research and finds a translator in Kanai Dutt, a businessman from Delhi whose idealistic aunt and uncle are longtime settlers in the Sundarbans. 

As the three of them launch into the elaborate backwaters, they are drawn unawares into the hidden undercurrents of this isolated world, where political turmoil exacts a personal toll that is every bit as powerful as the ravaging tide. Already an international success, The Hungry Tide is a prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity.",The Hungry Tide,Amitav Ghosh, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780007432974,"1st Edition,2004",403,Abroad,English

Sidney Sheldon’s Tell Me Your Dreams introduces three very different women at the onset of the novel. Introduced first is Ashley Peterson, a beautiful young woman who works for a computer company in Silicon Valley. Ashley is single and convinced she is being stalked. Readers next meet Ashley’s co-workers, Toni and Alette. Toni Prescott, a British woman in her early twenties is rather bold and striking. Rounding out the trio is Alette Peters, a quiet, dreamy romantic who moved to California from Rome. In the early stages of the novel, quite a few murders are committed and police in Chicago, San Francisco, and Quebec are desperate to solve the gruesome crimes that have taken place in each of their cities. Conclusive evidence points to one suspect and one suspect alone.

As the story develops, the reader learns why Ashley feels so alone in the world. She is the only child of a world-famous heart surgeon, who is often critical and overbearing. Although Ashley loves her father, she does not necessarily love his company and tries to avoid him. Toni is a provocateur with a penchant for song who suffered a strained relationship with her mother. Alette is a gifted artist who lacks self-confidence. As the novel draws to a conclusion, Ashley, Toni, and Alette are proven to be one in the same.

The reader will not be disappointed with Sheldon’s storytelling upon finishing this book. Sheldon provides a fascinating and precise examination of the different aspects of multiple personality disorder through the characters of Ashley, Toni, and Alette. He expertly draws the reader into his story, just as a fly is drawn into a spider’s web. Although this novel was a great effort, it is not one of Sheldon’s best—as portions of the plot are predictable. Sheldon’s ending, however, does have some panache.

The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd,আগাথা ক্রিস্টি,"",TK. 538,https://rokomari.com//book/129560/the-murder-of-roger-ackroyd,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/5db93ac69_129560.jpg,"'The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd' Summary of the book
The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was Christie’s sixth novel and was published in 1926. It was the third novel that featured the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Like many of her other novels, the book is set in a small town and focuses on the interactions between characters who are well known to one another.

When the novel was first published, critical reactions were mixed because of the unusual narrative structure. Christie chose to have the murderer tell the story from his point of view. This device caused some consternation because some believed that Christie was not “playing fair” with her readers. They reasoned that, in crime fiction, if the novel is to be fair, the reader should be able to follow the same path the detective does in order to solve the crime. Some believed that by having the narrator as the murderer, the reader would not be able to follow the path of the clues, since the murderer would, in order to protect his identity, conceal certain key pieces of information.

Christie circumvents this problem in several ways. First, Dr. Sheppard is an extremely believable character. Because of the remorseful tone he assumes at the beginning of the novel, the reader immediately trusts him and his observations. In addition, Poirot appears to trust Sheppard, including him in discussions with the police and, as Poirot admits, using Sheppard as a substitute for Captain Hastings, who had played Dr. Watson to Poirot’s Sherlock Holmes in previous novels. Thus, the reader is led to trust Sheppard because Poirot trusts him.

Sheppard also establishes an intimate rapport with the reader through the use of first-person narrative. The reader is privy to what are assumed to be the doctor’s private thoughts about Ackroyd’s murder. Poirot also confides in Sheppard and often asks his opinion of people within the town. Again, this action on the part of Christie serves to inspire confidence in the narrator; the reader does not suspect him because Poirot does not, and because Christie has, as in previous novels, established Poirot as a reliable source and a good judge of human nature.

Another aspect to the novel in regard to the narration is the comparatively small role that Poirot plays. The reader is accustomed to seeing him as the main character—almost as a master puppeteer who guides the movements of all around him. In fact, the readers expect Poirot to manipulate them, for this is the nature of crime fiction in general: The reader is manipulated by the detective to see things his or her way. Christie, however, chooses to radically depart from this formula. Instead of Poirot manipulating the reader, Sheppard manipulates both the reader and Poirot. The reader is unaware of this subterfuge, however, until the end of the novel, when all the other probable suspects have been eliminated and only Sheppard remains. The reader is then privy to Sheppard’s confession, and all the pieces to this very complex puzzle fall into place.

We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.

What’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.

Now, in Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom—and even of hope itself.

With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.",Everything Is F*cked: A Book About Hope,Mark Manson, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780062955951,"1st Published,2019",274,India,English

Soon after arriving at his hotel in Istanbul, private investigator Hercule Poirot is instructed to return to London immediately. He boards the Orient Express that very night and is accosted by Mr. Ratchett, whom he had earlier seen in his hotel in Istanbul. He attempts to hire Poirot believing that his life is under threat, but the detective refuses him outright.

On the second night of the journey, a snowdrift brings the train to a halt. A cry from Ratchett’s coach pierces the eerie silence of the night. The next morning, M. Bouc, the director of the company that operates the train and an acquaintance of Poirot, informs him of the shocking murder of Ratchett. Upon his request, Poirot agrees to investigate the case. Soon Poirot learns of Ratchett’s questionable past and the probable reasons for his murder.

In the United States a few years earlier, Daisy Armstrong, a 3 year old heiress was kidnapped and killed by a man, who went by the name Cassetti, in spite of collecting a ransom from her wealthy family. Suspected to have rigged the trial, Cassetti fled the country after his acquittal. Poirot came to the conclusion that Ratchett was none other than Cassetti.

What connects the people in Ratchett’s coach who were travelling with him on that fateful night of the murder? Is one of the members of the Armstrong family the murderer?

Murder on the Orient Express has been adapted to TV, film and radio as well. The book was first published in 1934.

#1 New York Times Bestseller!

In the second book of the Carve the Mark duology, globally bestselling Divergent author Veronica Roth reveals how Cyra and Akos fulfill their fates. The Fates Divide is a richly imagined tale of hope and resilience told in four stunning perspectives.

The lives of Cyra Noavek and Akos Kereseth are ruled by their fates, spoken by the oracles at their births. The fates, once determined, are inescapable.

Akos is in love with Cyra, in spite of his fate: He will die in service to Cyra’s family. And when Cyra’s father, Lazmet Noavek—a soulless tyrant, thought to be dead—reclaims the Shotet throne, Akos believes his end is closer than ever.

As Lazmet ignites a barbaric war, Cyra and Akos are desperate to stop him at any cost. For Cyra, that could mean taking the life of the man who may—or may not—be her father. For Akos, it could mean giving his own. In a stunning twist, the two will discover how fate defines their lives in ways most unexpected.

It was not that Stanton Rogers fancied himself a Casanova. On the contrary, until that one fatal bedroom escapade, he had been a model husband. He was handsome, wealthy, and on his way to one of the most important positions in the world, and although he had had ample opportunity to cheat on his wife, he had never given another woman a thought.",Windmills of the Gods,Sidney Sheldon, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9788172234829,"New Edition,2005",416,Abroad,English

The Fifth Mountain is set in the year 870 BC. Israel is being ruled by Phoenicians and Queen Jezebel wants to ensure that the people follow her own faith, one she brought from her native land. So, she orders the death of all those who do not bow down to her God, Baal.

One of these rebels is the Prophet Elijah. The Queen orders his death for refusing to obey her. Elijah flees to the lovely Phoenician city of Zarephath, which is also known by the Phoenician name of Akbar. This place was actually considered to be the abode of the God, though Elijah refused to acknowledge it.

There he meets a woman who is a worshipper of Baal. Though their religious views differ and she is older than him, Elijah and the woman are attracted to each other. But they don't discuss their feelings openly. Meanwhile, Elijah, who has been sent to this place by an angel, wants to rid Israel of the tyranny of Queen Jezebel.

But due to a surprising turn of events, the people of Akbar accept him as a sage. They consider him one of their own and come to him for advice and to settle disputes. As Elijah begins to bond with these people, he suffers from conflicting ambitions. He cannot decide whether to remain in Akbar, his adopted city, or to return to Israel. Subsequently, the destructive Assyrian invasion on Akbar worsens Elijah’s dilemma.
In The Fifth Mountain, through the context of a religious tale, the author conveys the importance of finding one's own destiny, even if it seems like it will involve rebelling against God's will. He insists that in doing so, one will find oneself getting closer to God.

Cards on the Table is a detective novel by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 2 November 1936 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence and the US edition at $2.00.

The book features the recurring characters of Hercule Poirot, Colonel Race, Superintendent Battle and the bumbling crime writer Ariadne Oliver, making her first appearance in a Poirot novel. The four detectives and four possible suspects play bridge after dinner with Mr Shaitana. At the end of the evening, Mr Shaitana is discovered murdered. Identifying the murderer, per Mrs Christie, depends wholly on discerning the psychology of the suspects.

This novel was well received at first printing and in later reviews. It was noted for its humour, for the subtlety of the writing, good clueing and tight writing, showing continuing improvement in the author's writing style in this, her twentieth novel. One later reviewer considered this in the top rung of her novels, and another found it to be most original, with a brilliant surprise ending.

In this compilation of eight marvellous short stories, Agatha Christie delights readers with the presence of her three male sleuths in six respective stories. Two stories each for Parker Pyne, the duo Harley Quin-Satterthwaite and Hercule Poirot ‘the police hound.’ In the two other, two women on a crossroads of their life are faced with difficult decision to make.


The map of Majorca, Spain where Parker Pyne has to resolve a rift between two women while on holiday.

Presumably first appeared in the UK magazines, seven of them were written in the twenties and in the  thirties. Only The Harlequin Tea Set was in 1971. Interestingly, the copyright of five of them were signed as Mrs. Mallowan; hence after her divorce in 1928.

Poirot’s cases concern with a reconstruction of a suicide and the death of an old eccentric well-to-do man who summons the Belgian to his home. In the former story, it starts when he receives a telephone call from a mysterious woman begging for his help. ‘…table with yellow irises,’ she sounds frightened  of being overheard. In the latter, a shot is heard moments after the first gong for dinner but a guest firmly believes of having heard the second gong. Four years later the same plot appears in Dead Man’s Mirror (see Notes On The Murder In The Mews) with alterations to the character names.

In the non-detective stories, two female protagonists must make her choice. On the one hand, it is between a dog or starvation in Next To A Dog; the dog being the very memory of a dead husband. On the other, Theodora Darrel undergoes a battle of will between loyalty vs happiness. Will she still walk out from her marriage having known that her husband has been in a serious charge of theft and fraud?
The Love Detectives (1926) seems to mark the early appearance of Harley Quin; an enigmatic man of whom his path is crossed with Mr. Satterthwaite’s on a number of occasions (see Notes On The Mysterious Mr. Quin). In a dark night both meets when their car collide; Sattwerthwaite is with Colonel Melrose on their way to a crime scene. An aristocrat has been killed with a bronze figure of Venus. Then his beautiful wife and a male guest whom stays over in the house confess of the murder. Who is one to believe?

Any readers who remember Mrs. Protheroe and Lawrence Redding     will understand what  occurs next in the story (see Notes On The Murder At The Vicarage).  The clock is changed to suit the alibi of a suspect and the study also becomes where the ‘thing’ happens. In Miss Marple’s case, however, the deceased’s wife and her

As the book begins, Athena is dead. How she ended up that way creates the intrigue sustaining the book. The child, Sherine Khalil renames herself Athena after her uncle was discussing with her mother on how her real name will betray her origins and something like Athena gave nothing away. As a child, she shows a strong religious vocation and reports seeing angels and saints, which both impresses and worries her parents.

She goes into a London University to pursue Engineering at the age of 19 but it's not what her heart wanted. One day she just decides that she wanted to drop out of college, get married and have a baby. Here, the author mentions that this might be due to the fact that she was abandoned herself and wants to give all that love she could to her child which she didn't receive from her birth mother. Two years later, her marriage falls apart because they are facing too many problems due to their young age and lack of money or mostly because he felt that she loved only the child and used him to get what she wanted. A very interesting quote she uses is ""From Ancient Greece on, the people who returned from battle were either dead on their shields or stronger, despite or because of their scars. It's better that way: I've lived on a battlefield since I was born, but I'm still alive and I don't need anyone to protect me."" She grows into a woman in search of answers to many questions that arise within a person. She had a life which many felt was content because she had a child of her own, money, and friends; everything but her mind was at peace, so she searches for the answer to the classical question of ""Who am I?"" through many experiences. In her quest, she opens her heart to intoxicating powers of mother and becomes a controversial spiritual leader in London.",The Witch of Portobello,Paulo Coelho, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780007257447,"1st Published,2007",324,India,English

Ashoke Ganguli and Ashima Ganguli, a couple away from their home in Bengal, are about to have their first child in Massachusetts. While Ashoke Ganguli is studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the young wife is lost in the alien land with not many around to help her and no friends she could talk to and hang out with. Now, their young boy has to be named by an elder person in the family, as a part of the tradition followed in Bengali families. This honour has been given to Ashima’s grandmother. Due to circumstances, the couple find out that they cannot leave the hospital without naming the child. Ashoke thus chooses the name of his favourite Russian author, Gogol, for time being. But when Ashima’s grandmother passes away before picking a name for her great grandson, the boy remains Gogol. Although he likes his name initially, he starts to dislike it by the time he begins going to high school. And he formally changes his name to Nikhil before leaving for higher studies, and becomes Nikhil Gogol Ganguli. Ashima is extremely unhappy with her son when he starts becoming more of an American, and Ashoke remains quiet about all this until he finds the right time to tell Gogol why he chose that name. The reason behind a name is what constitutes the soul of the story, which changes the young man forever. This timeless story will certainly leave in thoughts that overwhelm you each time you recall it.

The answer to the riddle is brilliant.""

Maurice Richardson was pleased to see the return of Poirot to Christie's works when he reviewed the novel in the 10 January 1943 issue of The Observer. He concluded, ""Despite only five suspects, Mrs. Christie, as usual, puts a ring through the reader's nose and leads him to one of her smashing last-minute showdowns. This is well up to the standard of her middle Poirot period. No more need be said.""

J.D. Beresford in The Guardian's 20 January 1943 review, wrote: ""Miss Agatha Christie never fails us, and her Five Little Pigs presents a very pretty problem for the ingenious reader."" It concluded that the clue to who committed the crime was, ""completely satisfying.""

Robert Barnard: ""The-murder-in-the-past plot on its first and best appearance – accept no later substitutes. Presentation more intricate than usual, characterization more subtle.""

																																										Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain.

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end.

This novel has been greatly appreciated by its readers, being labeled as the most important book of the 20th century by the Children’s Books Of The Century poll, published in Books For Keeps.

Grabbing every chance he could, Sidney worked nights as a bus-boy, a clerk, an usher - anything - but he dreamt of becoming something more.
His dream was to become a writer and to break into Hollywood. By a stroke of luck, he found work as a reader for David Selznick, a top Hollywood producer, and the dream began to materialise. Sheldon worked through the night writing stories for the movies, and librettos for the musical theatre. Little by little he gained a reputation and soon found himself in demand by the hottest producers and stars in Hollywood.

A novel rich in metaphors and symbolism, The Alchemist is a story based on the adventures of a young shepherd boy, who, upon deciding to follow his prophetic dreams, sets on a treasure hunt. This journey introduces him to some remarkable people who leave an indelible and profound mark on him.  

Summary Of The Book: 
The Alchemist was first published in 1988. The protagonist of the story, a young Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago, is plagued with recurring dreams, wherein a mysterious child urges him to look for buried treasure at the base of the Egyptian pyramids. Determined, he leaves Spain and heads towards Egypt. En route, he meets the King of Salem, a man named Melchizedek. Melchizedek introduces Santiago to the concept of a ‘Personal Legend’ or a personal map or a quest that guides him to what his heart truly desires.
While attempting to cross the Sahara desert on the way to Egypt, he joins a caravan which is driven by an Englishman who is aspiring to be an alchemist. During a stop over in Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets Fatima, a young girl of exceeding beauty who steals his heart. He asks her to marry him, but she declines saying that she will do so only once he has found the treasure he seeks. In the Saharan oasis of Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets a 200 year old alchemist who decides to accompany him on his expedition. He imparts wisdom and valuable knowledge to Santiago, who eventually understands why the supposed treasure keeps evading him.
Having sold over 65 million copies worldwide, The Alchemist is marked by its profound simplicity, the easy flow of the story, and the poignant moral it tries to teach the reader, that worldly possessions and extravagance are immaterial when compared to finding your own ‘Personal Legend’.",The Alchemist (About 150 Million Copies Sold),Paulo Coelho, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9788172234980,"1st Edition,2015",192,Abroad,English

Eleven Minutes is the story of Maria, a young girl from a small village in Brazil. She is disillusioned by her failures in love. She moves to Geneva, Switzerland, aspiring to live the life of her dreams - a life filled with fame and fortune. Her dreams are shattered when she is introduced to the harsh realities of life.

One day, a chance encounter with an Arab man earns her a thousand francs for one night. Lured by the prospect of easy money, she ends up becoming a prostitute in a brothel in Geneva’s red-light district. Once there, she quickly learns the ropes and becomes quite successful, not to mention the envy of her colleagues. She shuts the door on love and only has time for the demands made by her body.

Her life is thrown into disarray when she meets a young Swiss painter named Ralf. She falls in love with Ralf, who is completely different from her. Her carnal feelings for Ralf and her true love for him vie for supremacy. She finally decides to move away from Geneva because she sees no future for them. But just before she leaves, she discovers the beautiful blend of sex and true love with Ralf.

Maria’s journey begins with disillusionment. It brings about her sexual awakening and eventually, almost brings her to the point of self-destruction. She sinks to the depths of despair before her phoenix-like rise to self-discovery and the heights of love.

Maria’s story explores the concepts of sex, prostitution, sadomasochism, and true love.

Eleven Minutes was published in 2003. It was originally written in Portuguese, and has been translated into several languages since then.

Currently ranked World No. 1 in women's doubles, Sania Mirza became an instant sensation when she won the Wimbledon Championships girls' doubles title at the age of sixteen. From 2003 until her retirement from the singles circuit in 2012, she was ranked by the Women's Tennis Association as India's top player, both in singles and doubles. A six-time Grand Slam champion, she notched up an incredible forty-one consecutive wins with her doubles partner, Martina Hingis, between August 2015 and February 2016.

Ace against Odds is the story of this most iconic Indian player who beat incredible odds to get to the top of her sport. Sania writes with candour of the hardships along the way, of the physical and emotional trauma caused by injuries and medical procedures, of the friends and partners who became her mainstay along with her family, of the pressures of constant public scrutiny and, not least, the politics and heartbreaks that inevitably accompany success.

Sania broke the rules, she spoke her mind, she pushed herself to the limit, she played for India fiercely and without care for how it might impact her rankings - she is and will continue to remain an inspiration long after she steps off the tennis courts.(goodreads.com)",Ace Against Odds,Sania Mirza, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789351362630,"1st Edition,2016",288,India,English

As she feels that nothing can fill this void she decides one fine day that she is going to die and consumes several sleeping pills. While she is surprised to find herself still alive when she wakes up in a local mental hospital, she is told that her wish to die will come true in a matter of days as the overdose on the pills has caused irreparable damage to her heart. 
However, it is in these last few days of life that Veronika starts to actually appreciate things around her. She starts to feel things that she has never felt before like: love, fear, hatred, sexual awakening and curiosity.

Looking For Alaska, John Green’s debut novel was first published in 2005. Looking For Alaska follows the life of Miles Halter, as he leaves Florida to join boarding school in Alabama. He joins Culver Creek, the boarding school, later than usual, as he himself mentions that he is looking for a “Great Perhaps”.

Among his quirks include memorizing the last words of famous people and the “Great Perhaps” was that of Francois Rabelais. Miles receives the nickname Pudge in school, and though his was a figure that was nothing like the name entailed, it stuck.

His roommate and friend is Chip, who is the person who introduces him to Alaska Young, the Alaska mentioned in the title of the story. The adventures that they are involved in together cause him to fall in love with Alaska, and the entire book is written in first person. Most of the book is written as a countdown to a specific occurrence, which occurs in the rest of the book and it is easy to gather from the title, what this section would cover.

Though mostly mature and insightful, readers often get a peek into the sex addled mind of a sixteen year old school student, one who is forever counting the number of layers of clothing separating him from the bare body of the girl he is presently with.

Looking For Alaska won the 2006 Michael L. Printz Award from the American Library Association. It broke into the New York Times Bestseller list at number 10 in 2012, much after its debut in 2005. The film rights to the book have been sold to Paramount Pictures, though the project hasn’t been greenlighted yet due to lack of sufficient interest.

Hercule Poirot finds himself the uninvited guest at the scene of an elaborately planned murder on wheels. The Belgian detective is making his way from Istanbul, Turkey, to London, and he is looking forward to a leisurely trip and a chance to clear his head, a chance to rest his “little grey cells,” as Poirot refers to his brain.

A good friend of Poirot, M. Bouc, is an administrator with Wagon Lit, the train company that operates the Orient Express. Poirot prefers to travel first class. Because it is winter, off season for tourists, the detective is assured by Bouc that finding a first-class cabin on the train will be easy. To their surprise, the car leaving Istanbul, the Calais Coach, is nearly full. There is, however, one no-show, and Poirot finds himself sharing a compartment with Hector MacQueen, the private secretary to a wealthy American, Mr. Ratchett.

Poirot is introduced by Bouc to Dr. Constantine, a Greek physician, traveling in the next car. On the first night of the journey, as they sit in the dining car, Bouc points out to Poirot the variety of travelers in the dining car: the rich and the poor. Some are English, some American, some French, some Italian, some Russian, some Hungarian—an array of passengers from differing socioeconomic backgrounds and different cultures. Where else in the world, Bouc wonders aloud, could one find such an assortment of people beneath one roof? Yes, Poirot thinks to himself, perhaps only in America.

The first night passes peacefully, and Bouc moves Poirot from his shared cabin with MacQueen to a private one next door to Ratchett. During the second night of the trip, Poirot has trouble sleeping, awakened by voices, service bells summoning conductor Pierre Michel, and thumping on his cabin door. At about 1:15 a.m., Poirot sticks his head out of his cabin and sees a woman wearing a kimono with a dragon print walking down the corridor. He hears his neighbor, Ratchett, tell the conductor in perfect French that nothing is wrong and that he had not meant to ring his service bell. The train is stopped, too, as an avalanche of snow covers the tracks.

Ratchett, Poirot has determined, is an evil man. The evil shows on his face, and Poirot has taken an instant dislike in him. Earlier in the evening, Poirot had been approached by Ratchett and was offered a job—to keep Ratchett alive. Ratchett has been receiving hate mail and otherwise threatening letters.

This book, Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges, takes up the story from when A.P.J Abdul Kalam became the President of India. It covers his acceptance of the post of the President of India, his term in office, his efforts to make his term meaningful, and the challenges he faced.

His term from 2002 to 2007 was an eventful one. The President of India is just a titular head with minimal powers. But, the office is one of great influence and Kalam used it to best effect. He got the government and the public to focus on issues that were relevant to the country's all round growth.

He initiated programs like PURA to try and integrate rural areas into the general economic and technological growth of the country. He dreamt of taking the whole of India on his vision for the country in the new millennium, and he saw no reason why the villages should be left out in this vision.

Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges is more about Kalam’s vision for his country rather than about himself. He tries to provide a blueprint for development, and for reforms in the government and judiciary.

Dr.Kalam is a strong advocate for the use of technology and a proponent of e-governance. Even the little bits of personal experience during his term that he gives, he links with these ideas. For instance, he mentions the controversial dissolution of the Bihar assembly for which he later offered to resign. But, he does not focus on the political or personal implications of this decision, instead, he chose to highlight his use of electronic communication in lending his approval to this move, for he was in Moscow at that time.

He made the office of the President accessible to the public. He used his popularity and high visibility to inspire the youth of the country and convince them to believe in his 2020 vision for India. He urged the young people to dream big, and to believe in their country's destiny. Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges describes the term in office of one of the most charismatic Presidents of the country.

Winning, published in 2010, is a self-help management guide to help readers find answers to some of the most difficult questions of their professional lives. Winning starts off with an introduction, where Jack Welch says that the most commonly asked question is, What does it take to win?

The first part of the book, Underneath It All, describes Jack’s management philosophy. The author says that an organization should take ideas from every level, and not just the top leaders. The next part is titled Your Company, and focuses on the inner working of an organization. The authors speak about leadership, hiring, how to part ways, and crisis management. Your Competition is the third portion of Winning, and it speaks about the world outside of an organization.

Readers will learn how to devise meaningful budgets, grow through mergers and acquisitions, create strategic advantages, and make use of Six Sigma. In Your Career, the authors encourage readers to find the right job, to understand what it takes to get promoted, and learn how to handle a bad boss. Winning also says that maintaining a good work-life balance is essential. The last part, Tying Up Loose Ends, answers nine questions that do not fall in the above categories, like managing the China threat.

Winning is filled with personal stories and experiences, and has been written with a no-nonsense attitude. This book offers no easy solutions on how to win, as there really are none. This guide was on the top of The Wall Street Journal bestseller list, and has also been on The New York Times' bestseller list.

Balram Halwai narrates his life in a letter, written in seven consecutive nights and addressed to the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao. In his letter, Balram explains how he, the son of a puller, escaped a life of servitude to become a successful businessman, describing himself as an entrepreneur.

Balram was born in the rural village of Laxmangarh, where he lived with his grandmother, parents, brother and extended family. He is a smart child but is forced to leave school in order to help pay for his cousin's dowry and begins to work in a teashop with his brother in Dhanbad. While working there he begins to learn about India's government and economy from the customers' conversations. Balram describes himself as a bad servant but a good listener and decides to become a driver.

After learning how to drive, Balram finds a job driving Ashok, the son of one of Laxmangarh's landlords. He takes over the job of the main driver, from a small car to a heavy-luxury described Honda City. He stops sending money back to his family and disrespects his grandmother during a trip back to his village. Balram moves to New Delhi with Ashok and his wife Pinky Madam. Throughout their time in Delhi, Balram is exposed to extensive corruption, especially in the government. In Delhi, the contrast between the poor and the wealthy is made even more evident by their proximity to one another.

One night Pinky Madam takes the wheel from Balram, while drunk, hits something in the road and drives away; we are left to assume that she has killed a child. Ashok's family puts pressure on Balram to confess that he had been driving alone. Ashok becomes increasingly involved in bribing government officials for the benefit of the family coal business. Balram then decides that killing Ashok will be the only way to escape India's Rooster Coop. After bludgeoning Ashok with a bottle and stealing a large bribe, Balram moves to Bangalore, where he bribes the police in order to help start his own taxi business. Ashok too is portrayed to be trapped in the metaphorical Rooster Coop: his family controls what he does and society dictates how he acts. Just like Ashok, Balram pays off a family whose son one of his taxi drivers hit and killed. Balram explains that his own family was almost certainly killed by Ashok's relatives as retribution for his murder. At the end of the novel, Balram rationalizes his actions and considers that his freedom is worth the lives of his family and of Ashok. And thus ends the letter to Jiabao, letting the reader think of the dark humour of the tale, as well as the idea of life as a trap introduced by the writer.(wiki)",The White Tiger,Aravind Adiga, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789352645060,"Reprinted,2017",324,India,English

Pointing to the horizon where the sea and sky are joined, he says, ‘It is only an illusion because they can’t really meet, but isn’t it beautiful, this union which isn’t really there.’ – SAADAT HASAN MANTO Sometime in 2016, a series of dialogues took place which set out to find a meeting ground, even if only an illusion, between A.S. Dulat and Asad Durrani. One was a former chief of RAW, India’s external intelligence agency, the other of ISI, its Pakistani counterpart. As they could not meet in their home countries, the conversations, guided by journalist Aditya Sinha, took place in cities like Istanbul, Bangkok and Kathmandu. On the table were subjects that have long haunted South Asia, flashpoints that take lives regularly. It was in all ways a deep dive into the politics of the subcontinent, as seen through the eyes of two spymasters. Among the subjects: Kashmir, and a missed opportunity for peace; Hafiz Saeed and 26/11; Kulbhushan Jadhav; surgical strikes; the deal for Osama bin Laden; how the US and Russia feature in the India-Pakistan relationship; and how terror undermines the two countries’ attempts at talks. When the project was first mooted, General Durrani laughed and said nobody would believe it even if it was written as fiction. At a time of fraught relations, this unlikely dialogue between two former spy chiefs from opposite sides-a project that is the first of its kind-may well provide some answers.

How is it, then, that today the former British colonial trading post is a thriving Asian metropolis with not only the world's number one airline, best airport, and busiest port of trade, but also the world's fourth–highest per capita real income?

The story of that transformation is told here by Singapore's charismatic, controversial founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. Rising from a legacy of divisive colonialism, the devastation of the Second World War, and general poverty and disorder following the withdrawal of foreign forces, Singapore now is hailed as a city of the future. This miraculous history is dramatically recounted by the man who not only lived through it all but who fearlessly forged ahead and brought about most of these changes.

Delving deep into his own meticulous notes, as well as previously unpublished government papers and official records, Lee details the extraordinary efforts it took for an island city–state in Southeast Asia to survive at that time.

Lee explains how he and his cabinet colleagues finished off the communist threat to the fledgling state's security and began the arduous process of nation building: forging basic infrastructural roads through a land that still consisted primarily of swamps, creating an army from a hitherto racially and ideologically divided population, stamping out the last vestiges of colonial–era corruption, providing mass public housing, and establishing a national airline and airport.

In this illuminating account, Lee writes frankly about his trenchant approach to political opponents and his often unorthodox views on human rights, democracy, and inherited intelligence, aiming always ""to be correct, not politically correct."" Nothing in Singapore escaped his watchful eye: whether choosing shrubs for the greening of the country, restoring the romance of the historic Raffles Hotel, or openly, unabashedly persuading young men to marry women as well educated as themselves. Today's safe, tidy Singapore bears Lee's unmistakable stamp, for which he is unapologetic: ""If this is a nanny state, I am proud to have fostered one.""

Though Lee's domestic canvas in Singapore was small, his vigor and talent assured him a larger place in world affairs. With inimitable style, he brings history to life with cogent analyses of some of the greatest strategic issues of recent times and reveals how, over the years, he navigated the shifting tides of relations among America, China, and Taiwan, acting as confidant, sounding board, and messenger for them. He also includes candid, sometimes acerbic pen portraits of his political peers, including the indomitable Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, the poetry–spouting Jiang Zemin, and ideologues George Bush and Deng Xiaoping.

Lee also lifts the veil on his family life and writes tenderly of his wife and stalwart partner, Kwa Geok Choo, and of their pride in their three children –– particularly the eldest son, Hsien Loong, who is now Singapore's deputy prime minister.

For more than three decades, Lee Kuan Yew has been praised and vilified in equal measure, and he has established himself as a force impossible to ignore in Asian and international politics. From Third World to First offers readers a compelling glimpse into this visionary's heart, soul, and mind.",From Third World to First,Lee Kuan Yew, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780060197766,1st Edition,752,Abroad,English

Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain. 

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end. 
This novel has been greatly appreciated by its readers, being labeled as the most important book of the 20th century by the Children’s Books Of The Century poll, published in Books For Keeps. Although the exact number is not known, there have been 35-100 million copies of The Hobbit sold, till date, since it’s publishing in the year 1937. The Hobbit has also been adapted into a movie, whose first part, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey released in the United States on the 14th of December 2012. This movie was directed by Peter Jackson, and the second, and third parts are scheduled to release in 2013, and 2014.

A prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity set in the Sundarbans, an immense labyrinth of tiny islands on the easternmost coast of India.

The Hungry Tide is a very contemporary story of adventure and unlikely love, identity and history, set in one of the most fascinating regions on the earth. Off the easternmost coast of India, in the Bay of Bengal, lies the immense labyrinth of tiny islands known as the Sundarbans. 

For settlers here, life is extremely precarious. Attacks by deadly tigers are common. Unrest and eviction are constant threats. Without warning, at any time, tidal floods rise and surge over the land, leaving devastation in their wake. In this place of vengeful beauty, the lives of three people from different worlds collide. Piya Roy is a young marine biologist, of Indian descent but stubbornly American, in search of a rare, endangered river dolphin. 

Her journey begins with a disaster, when she is thrown from a boat into crocodile-infested waters. Rescue comes in the form of a young, illiterate fisherman, Fokir. Although they have no language between them, Piya and Fokir are powerfully drawn to each other, sharing an uncanny instinct for the ways of the sea. Piya engages Fokir to help with her research and finds a translator in Kanai Dutt, a businessman from Delhi whose idealistic aunt and uncle are longtime settlers in the Sundarbans. 

As the three of them launch into the elaborate backwaters, they are drawn unawares into the hidden undercurrents of this isolated world, where political turmoil exacts a personal toll that is every bit as powerful as the ravaging tide. Already an international success, The Hungry Tide is a prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity.",The Hungry Tide,Amitav Ghosh, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780007432974,"1st Edition,2004",403,Abroad,English

Sidney Sheldon’s Tell Me Your Dreams introduces three very different women at the onset of the novel. Introduced first is Ashley Peterson, a beautiful young woman who works for a computer company in Silicon Valley. Ashley is single and convinced she is being stalked. Readers next meet Ashley’s co-workers, Toni and Alette. Toni Prescott, a British woman in her early twenties is rather bold and striking. Rounding out the trio is Alette Peters, a quiet, dreamy romantic who moved to California from Rome. In the early stages of the novel, quite a few murders are committed and police in Chicago, San Francisco, and Quebec are desperate to solve the gruesome crimes that have taken place in each of their cities. Conclusive evidence points to one suspect and one suspect alone.

As the story develops, the reader learns why Ashley feels so alone in the world. She is the only child of a world-famous heart surgeon, who is often critical and overbearing. Although Ashley loves her father, she does not necessarily love his company and tries to avoid him. Toni is a provocateur with a penchant for song who suffered a strained relationship with her mother. Alette is a gifted artist who lacks self-confidence. As the novel draws to a conclusion, Ashley, Toni, and Alette are proven to be one in the same.

The reader will not be disappointed with Sheldon’s storytelling upon finishing this book. Sheldon provides a fascinating and precise examination of the different aspects of multiple personality disorder through the characters of Ashley, Toni, and Alette. He expertly draws the reader into his story, just as a fly is drawn into a spider’s web. Although this novel was a great effort, it is not one of Sheldon’s best—as portions of the plot are predictable. Sheldon’s ending, however, does have some panache.

The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was Christie’s sixth novel and was published in 1926. It was the third novel that featured the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Like many of her other novels, the book is set in a small town and focuses on the interactions between characters who are well known to one another.

When the novel was first published, critical reactions were mixed because of the unusual narrative structure. Christie chose to have the murderer tell the story from his point of view. This device caused some consternation because some believed that Christie was not “playing fair” with her readers. They reasoned that, in crime fiction, if the novel is to be fair, the reader should be able to follow the same path the detective does in order to solve the crime. Some believed that by having the narrator as the murderer, the reader would not be able to follow the path of the clues, since the murderer would, in order to protect his identity, conceal certain key pieces of information.

Christie circumvents this problem in several ways. First, Dr. Sheppard is an extremely believable character. Because of the remorseful tone he assumes at the beginning of the novel, the reader immediately trusts him and his observations. In addition, Poirot appears to trust Sheppard, including him in discussions with the police and, as Poirot admits, using Sheppard as a substitute for Captain Hastings, who had played Dr. Watson to Poirot’s Sherlock Holmes in previous novels. Thus, the reader is led to trust Sheppard because Poirot trusts him.

Sheppard also establishes an intimate rapport with the reader through the use of first-person narrative. The reader is privy to what are assumed to be the doctor’s private thoughts about Ackroyd’s murder. Poirot also confides in Sheppard and often asks his opinion of people within the town. Again, this action on the part of Christie serves to inspire confidence in the narrator; the reader does not suspect him because Poirot does not, and because Christie has, as in previous novels, established Poirot as a reliable source and a good judge of human nature.

Another aspect to the novel in regard to the narration is the comparatively small role that Poirot plays. The reader is accustomed to seeing him as the main character—almost as a master puppeteer who guides the movements of all around him. In fact, the readers expect Poirot to manipulate them, for this is the nature of crime fiction in general: The reader is manipulated by the detective to see things his or her way. Christie, however, chooses to radically depart from this formula. Instead of Poirot manipulating the reader, Sheppard manipulates both the reader and Poirot. The reader is unaware of this subterfuge, however, until the end of the novel, when all the other probable suspects have been eliminated and only Sheppard remains. The reader is then privy to Sheppard’s confession, and all the pieces to this very complex puzzle fall into place.

We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.

What’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.

Now, in Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom—and even of hope itself.

With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.",Everything Is F*cked: A Book About Hope,Mark Manson, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780062955951,"1st Published,2019",274,India,English

Soon after arriving at his hotel in Istanbul, private investigator Hercule Poirot is instructed to return to London immediately. He boards the Orient Express that very night and is accosted by Mr. Ratchett, whom he had earlier seen in his hotel in Istanbul. He attempts to hire Poirot believing that his life is under threat, but the detective refuses him outright.

On the second night of the journey, a snowdrift brings the train to a halt. A cry from Ratchett’s coach pierces the eerie silence of the night. The next morning, M. Bouc, the director of the company that operates the train and an acquaintance of Poirot, informs him of the shocking murder of Ratchett. Upon his request, Poirot agrees to investigate the case. Soon Poirot learns of Ratchett’s questionable past and the probable reasons for his murder.

In the United States a few years earlier, Daisy Armstrong, a 3 year old heiress was kidnapped and killed by a man, who went by the name Cassetti, in spite of collecting a ransom from her wealthy family. Suspected to have rigged the trial, Cassetti fled the country after his acquittal. Poirot came to the conclusion that Ratchett was none other than Cassetti.

What connects the people in Ratchett’s coach who were travelling with him on that fateful night of the murder? Is one of the members of the Armstrong family the murderer?

Murder on the Orient Express has been adapted to TV, film and radio as well. The book was first published in 1934.

#1 New York Times Bestseller!

In the second book of the Carve the Mark duology, globally bestselling Divergent author Veronica Roth reveals how Cyra and Akos fulfill their fates. The Fates Divide is a richly imagined tale of hope and resilience told in four stunning perspectives.

The lives of Cyra Noavek and Akos Kereseth are ruled by their fates, spoken by the oracles at their births. The fates, once determined, are inescapable.

Akos is in love with Cyra, in spite of his fate: He will die in service to Cyra’s family. And when Cyra’s father, Lazmet Noavek—a soulless tyrant, thought to be dead—reclaims the Shotet throne, Akos believes his end is closer than ever.

As Lazmet ignites a barbaric war, Cyra and Akos are desperate to stop him at any cost. For Cyra, that could mean taking the life of the man who may—or may not—be her father. For Akos, it could mean giving his own. In a stunning twist, the two will discover how fate defines their lives in ways most unexpected.

The Fifth Mountain is set in the year 870 BC. Israel is being ruled by Phoenicians and Queen Jezebel wants to ensure that the people follow her own faith, one she brought from her native land. So, she orders the death of all those who do not bow down to her God, Baal.

One of these rebels is the Prophet Elijah. The Queen orders his death for refusing to obey her. Elijah flees to the lovely Phoenician city of Zarephath, which is also known by the Phoenician name of Akbar. This place was actually considered to be the abode of the God, though Elijah refused to acknowledge it.

There he meets a woman who is a worshipper of Baal. Though their religious views differ and she is older than him, Elijah and the woman are attracted to each other. But they don't discuss their feelings openly. Meanwhile, Elijah, who has been sent to this place by an angel, wants to rid Israel of the tyranny of Queen Jezebel.

But due to a surprising turn of events, the people of Akbar accept him as a sage. They consider him one of their own and come to him for advice and to settle disputes. As Elijah begins to bond with these people, he suffers from conflicting ambitions. He cannot decide whether to remain in Akbar, his adopted city, or to return to Israel. Subsequently, the destructive Assyrian invasion on Akbar worsens Elijah’s dilemma.
In The Fifth Mountain, through the context of a religious tale, the author conveys the importance of finding one's own destiny, even if it seems like it will involve rebelling against God's will. He insists that in doing so, one will find oneself getting closer to God.

Cards on the Table is a detective novel by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 2 November 1936 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence and the US edition at $2.00.

The book features the recurring characters of Hercule Poirot, Colonel Race, Superintendent Battle and the bumbling crime writer Ariadne Oliver, making her first appearance in a Poirot novel. The four detectives and four possible suspects play bridge after dinner with Mr Shaitana. At the end of the evening, Mr Shaitana is discovered murdered. Identifying the murderer, per Mrs Christie, depends wholly on discerning the psychology of the suspects.

This novel was well received at first printing and in later reviews. It was noted for its humour, for the subtlety of the writing, good clueing and tight writing, showing continuing improvement in the author's writing style in this, her twentieth novel. One later reviewer considered this in the top rung of her novels, and another found it to be most original, with a brilliant surprise ending.

In this compilation of eight marvellous short stories, Agatha Christie delights readers with the presence of her three male sleuths in six respective stories. Two stories each for Parker Pyne, the duo Harley Quin-Satterthwaite and Hercule Poirot ‘the police hound.’ In the two other, two women on a crossroads of their life are faced with difficult decision to make.


The map of Majorca, Spain where Parker Pyne has to resolve a rift between two women while on holiday.

Presumably first appeared in the UK magazines, seven of them were written in the twenties and in the  thirties. Only The Harlequin Tea Set was in 1971. Interestingly, the copyright of five of them were signed as Mrs. Mallowan; hence after her divorce in 1928.

Poirot’s cases concern with a reconstruction of a suicide and the death of an old eccentric well-to-do man who summons the Belgian to his home. In the former story, it starts when he receives a telephone call from a mysterious woman begging for his help. ‘…table with yellow irises,’ she sounds frightened  of being overheard. In the latter, a shot is heard moments after the first gong for dinner but a guest firmly believes of having heard the second gong. Four years later the same plot appears in Dead Man’s Mirror (see Notes On The Murder In The Mews) with alterations to the character names.

In the non-detective stories, two female protagonists must make her choice. On the one hand, it is between a dog or starvation in Next To A Dog; the dog being the very memory of a dead husband. On the other, Theodora Darrel undergoes a battle of will between loyalty vs happiness. Will she still walk out from her marriage having known that her husband has been in a serious charge of theft and fraud?
The Love Detectives (1926) seems to mark the early appearance of Harley Quin; an enigmatic man of whom his path is crossed with Mr. Satterthwaite’s on a number of occasions (see Notes On The Mysterious Mr. Quin). In a dark night both meets when their car collide; Sattwerthwaite is with Colonel Melrose on their way to a crime scene. An aristocrat has been killed with a bronze figure of Venus.

As the book begins, Athena is dead. How she ended up that way creates the intrigue sustaining the book. The child, Sherine Khalil renames herself Athena after her uncle was discussing with her mother on how her real name will betray her origins and something like Athena gave nothing away. As a child, she shows a strong religious vocation and reports seeing angels and saints, which both impresses and worries her parents.

She goes into a London University to pursue Engineering at the age of 19 but it's not what her heart wanted. One day she just decides that she wanted to drop out of college, get married and have a baby. Here, the author mentions that this might be due to the fact that she was abandoned herself and wants to give all that love she could to her child which she didn't receive from her birth mother. Two years later, her marriage falls apart because they are facing too many problems due to their young age and lack of money or mostly because he felt that she loved only the child and used him to get what she wanted. A very interesting quote she uses is ""From Ancient Greece on, the people who returned from battle were either dead on their shields or stronger, despite or because of their scars. It's better that way: I've lived on a battlefield since I was born, but I'm still alive and I don't need anyone to protect me."" She grows into a woman in search of answers to many questions that arise within a person. She had a life which many felt was content because she had a child of her own, money, and friends; everything but her mind was at peace, so she searches for the answer to the classical question of ""Who am I?"" through many experiences. In her quest, she opens her heart to intoxicating powers of mother and becomes a controversial spiritual leader in London.",The Witch of Portobello,Paulo Coelho, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780007257447,"1st Published,2007",324,India,English

While Ashoke Ganguli is studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the young wife is lost in the alien land with not many around to help her and no friends she could talk to and hang out with. Now, their young boy has to be named by an elder person in the family, as a part of the tradition followed in Bengali families. This honour has been given to Ashima’s grandmother. Due to circumstances, the couple find out that they cannot leave the hospital without naming the child. Ashoke thus chooses the name of his favourite Russian author, Gogol, for time being. But when Ashima’s grandmother passes away before picking a name for her great grandson, the boy remains Gogol. Although he likes his name initially, he starts to dislike it by the time he begins going to high school. And he formally changes his name to Nikhil before leaving for higher studies, and becomes Nikhil Gogol Ganguli. Ashima is extremely unhappy with her son when he starts becoming more of an American, and Ashoke remains quiet about all this until he finds the right time to tell Gogol why he chose that name. The reason behind a name is what constitutes the soul of the story, which changes the young man forever.

Maurice Willson Disher's review in The Times Literary Supplement of 16 January 1943 concluded, ""No crime enthusiast will object that the story of how the painter died has to be told many times, for this, even if it creates an interest which is more problem than plot, demonstrates the author's uncanny skill. The answer to the riddle is brilliant.""

Maurice Richardson was pleased to see the return of Poirot to Christie's works when he reviewed the novel in the 10 January 1943 issue of The Observer. He concluded, ""Despite only five suspects, Mrs. Christie, as usual, puts a ring through the reader's nose and leads him to one of her smashing last-minute showdowns. This is well up to the standard of her middle Poirot period. No more need be said.""

J.D. Beresford in The Guardian's 20 January 1943 review, wrote: ""Miss Agatha Christie never fails us, and her Five Little Pigs presents a very pretty problem for the ingenious reader."" It concluded that the clue to who committed the crime was, ""completely satisfying.""

Robert Barnard: ""The-murder-in-the-past plot on its first and best appearance – accept no later substitutes. Presentation more intricate than usual, characterization more subtle."" All in all, it is a beautifully tailored book, rich and satisfying. The present writer would be willing to chance his arm and say that this is the best Christie of all.""

As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain.

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them.

Summary Of The Book: 
The Alchemist was first published in 1988. The protagonist of the story, a young Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago, is plagued with recurring dreams, wherein a mysterious child urges him to look for buried treasure at the base of the Egyptian pyramids. Determined, he leaves Spain and heads towards Egypt. En route, he meets the King of Salem, a man named Melchizedek. Melchizedek introduces Santiago to the concept of a ‘Personal Legend’ or a personal map or a quest that guides him to what his heart truly desires.
While attempting to cross the Sahara desert on the way to Egypt, he joins a caravan which is driven by an Englishman who is aspiring to be an alchemist. During a stop over in Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets Fatima, a young girl of exceeding beauty who steals his heart. He asks her to marry him, but she declines saying that she will do so only once he has found the treasure he seeks. In the Saharan oasis of Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets a 200 year old alchemist who decides to accompany him on his expedition. He imparts wisdom and valuable knowledge to Santiago, who eventually understands why the supposed treasure keeps evading him.
Having sold over 65 million copies worldwide, The Alchemist is marked by its profound simplicity, the easy flow of the story, and the poignant moral it tries to teach the reader, that worldly possessions and extravagance are immaterial when compared to finding your own ‘Personal Legend’.",The Alchemist (About 150 Million Copies Sold),Paulo Coelho, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9788172234980,"1st Edition,2015",192,Abroad,English

Currently ranked World No. 1 in women's doubles, Sania Mirza became an instant sensation when she won the Wimbledon Championships girls' doubles title at the age of sixteen. From 2003 until her retirement from the singles circuit in 2012, she was ranked by the Women's Tennis Association as India's top player, both in singles and doubles. A six-time Grand Slam champion, she notched up an incredible forty-one consecutive wins with her doubles partner, Martina Hingis, between August 2015 and February 2016.

Ace against Odds is the story of this most iconic Indian player who beat incredible odds to get to the top of her sport. Sania writes with candour of the hardships along the way, of the physical and emotional trauma caused by injuries and medical procedures, of the friends and partners who became her mainstay along with her family, of the pressures of constant public scrutiny and, not least, the politics and heartbreaks that inevitably accompany success.

Sania broke the rules, she spoke her mind, she pushed herself to the limit, she played for India fiercely and without care for how it might impact her rankings - she is and will continue to remain an inspiration long after she steps off the tennis courts.(goodreads.com)",Ace Against Odds,Sania Mirza, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789351362630,"1st Edition,2016",288,India,English

Veronika has everything that a young woman can think of having, but still isn’t satisfied with this as she feels a void within her. As she feels that nothing can fill this void she decides one fine day that she is going to die and consumes several sleeping pills. While she is surprised to find herself still alive when she wakes up in a local mental hospital, she is told that her wish to die will come true in a matter of days as the overdose on the pills has caused irreparable damage to her heart. 
However, it is in these last few days of life that Veronika starts to actually appreciate things around her. She starts to feel things that she has never felt before like: love, fear, hatred, sexual awakening and curiosity.

Looking For Alaska, John Green’s debut novel was first published in 2005. Looking For Alaska follows the life of Miles Halter, as he leaves Florida to join boarding school in Alabama. He joins Culver Creek, the boarding school, later than usual, as he himself mentions that he is looking for a “Great Perhaps”.

Among his quirks include memorizing the last words of famous people and the “Great Perhaps” was that of Francois Rabelais. Miles receives the nickname Pudge in school, and though his was a figure that was nothing like the name entailed, it stuck.

His roommate and friend is Chip, who is the person who introduces him to Alaska Young, the Alaska mentioned in the title of the story. The adventures that they are involved in together cause him to fall in love with Alaska, and the entire book is written in first person. Most of the book is written as a countdown to a specific occurrence, which occurs in the rest of the book and it is easy to gather from the title, what this section would cover.

Though mostly mature and insightful, readers often get a peek into the sex addled mind of a sixteen year old school student, one who is forever counting the number of layers of clothing separating him from the bare body of the girl he is presently with.

Looking For Alaska won the 2006 Michael L. Printz Award from the American Library Association. It broke into the New York Times Bestseller list at number 10 in 2012, much after its debut in 2005. The film rights to the book have been sold to Paramount Pictures, though the project hasn’t been greenlighted yet due to lack of sufficient interest.

After dinner, they’re all charged with their respective crimes by a gramophone recording. They can’t escape their would-be killer, who threatens to kill them in a manner similar to the old nursery rhyme, “ten little Indian boys.” Can they survive this nightmarish episode, or will they be doomed to die for their crimes?

Hercule Poirot finds himself the uninvited guest at the scene of an elaborately planned murder on wheels. The Belgian detective is making his way from Istanbul, Turkey, to London, and he is looking forward to a leisurely trip and a chance to clear his head, a chance to rest his “little grey cells,” as Poirot refers to his brain.

A good friend of Poirot, M. Bouc, is an administrator with Wagon Lit, the train company that operates the Orient Express. Poirot prefers to travel first class. Because it is winter, off season for tourists, the detective is assured by Bouc that finding a first-class cabin on the train will be easy. To their surprise, the car leaving Istanbul, the Calais Coach, is nearly full. There is, however, one no-show, and Poirot finds himself sharing a compartment with Hector MacQueen, the private secretary to a wealthy American, Mr. Ratchett.

Poirot is introduced by Bouc to Dr. Constantine, a Greek physician, traveling in the next car. On the first night of the journey, as they sit in the dining car, Bouc points out to Poirot the variety of travelers in the dining car: the rich and the poor. Some are English, some American, some French, some Italian, some Russian, some Hungarian—an array of passengers from differing socioeconomic backgrounds and different cultures. Where else in the world, Bouc wonders aloud, could one find such an assortment of people beneath one roof? Yes, Poirot thinks to himself, perhaps only in America.

The first night passes peacefully, and Bouc moves Poirot from his shared cabin with MacQueen to a private one next door to Ratchett. During the second night of the trip, Poirot has trouble sleeping, awakened by voices, service bells summoning conductor Pierre Michel, and thumping on his cabin door. At about 1:15 a.m., Poirot sticks his head out of his cabin and sees a woman wearing a kimono with a dragon print walking down the corridor. He hears his neighbor, Ratchett, tell the conductor in perfect French that nothing is wrong and that he had not meant to ring his service bell. The train is stopped, too, as an avalanche of snow covers the tracks.

Ratchett, Poirot has determined, is an evil man. The evil shows on his face, and Poirot has taken an instant dislike in him. Earlier in the evening, Poirot had been approached by Ratchett and was offered a job—to keep Ratchett alive. Ratchett has been receiving hate mail and otherwise threatening letters.

This book, Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges, takes up the story from when A.P.J Abdul Kalam became the President of India. It covers his acceptance of the post of the President of India, his term in office, his efforts to make his term meaningful, and the challenges he faced.

His term from 2002 to 2007 was an eventful one. The President of India is just a titular head with minimal powers. But, the office is one of great influence and Kalam used it to best effect. He got the government and the public to focus on issues that were relevant to the country's all round growth.

He initiated programs like PURA to try and integrate rural areas into the general economic and technological growth of the country. He dreamt of taking the whole of India on his vision for the country in the new millennium, and he saw no reason why the villages should be left out in this vision.

Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges is more about Kalam’s vision for his country rather than about himself. He tries to provide a blueprint for development, and for reforms in the government and judiciary.

Dr.Kalam is a strong advocate for the use of technology and a proponent of e-governance. Even the little bits of personal experience during his term that he gives, he links with these ideas. For instance, he mentions the controversial dissolution of the Bihar assembly for which he later offered to resign. But, he does not focus on the political or personal implications of this decision, instead, he chose to highlight his use of electronic communication in lending his approval to this move, for he was in Moscow at that time.

He made the office of the President accessible to the public. He used his popularity and high visibility to inspire the youth of the country and convince them to believe in his 2020 vision for India. He urged the young people to dream big, and to believe in their country's destiny. Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges describes the term in office of one of the most charismatic Presidents of the country.

About A.P.J. Abdul Kalam

Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is a renowned scientist, writer, administrator and former President of India.

Other books by Dr. Kalam - Developments in Fluid Mechanics and Space Technology, Ignited Minds: Unleashing the Power Within India, The Luminous Sparks, India 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium, and Wings of Fire: An Autobiography.

He has written autobiographies and books that detail his vision for the future of the country.

He then moved to Madras and studied Aerospace Engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology. After finishing his studies, he joined the DRDO’s Aeronautical Development Establishment.

Winning, published in 2010, is a self-help management guide to help readers find answers to some of the most difficult questions of their professional lives. Winning starts off with an introduction, where Jack Welch says that the most commonly asked question is, What does it take to win?

The first part of the book, Underneath It All, describes Jack’s management philosophy. The author says that an organization should take ideas from every level, and not just the top leaders. The next part is titled Your Company, and focuses on the inner working of an organization. The authors speak about leadership, hiring, how to part ways, and crisis management. Your Competition is the third portion of Winning, and it speaks about the world outside of an organization.

Readers will learn how to devise meaningful budgets, grow through mergers and acquisitions, create strategic advantages, and make use of Six Sigma. In Your Career, the authors encourage readers to find the right job, to understand what it takes to get promoted, and learn how to handle a bad boss. Winning also says that maintaining a good work-life balance is essential. The last part, Tying Up Loose Ends, answers nine questions that do not fall in the above categories, like managing the China threat.

Winning is filled with personal stories and experiences, and has been written with a no-nonsense attitude. This book offers no easy solutions on how to win, as there really are none. This guide was on the top of The Wall Street Journal bestseller list, and has also been on The New York Times' bestseller list.

He takes over the job of the main driver, from a small car to a heavy-luxury described Honda City. He stops sending money back to his family and disrespects his grandmother during a trip back to his village. Balram moves to New Delhi with Ashok and his wife Pinky Madam. Throughout their time in Delhi, Balram is exposed to extensive corruption, especially in the government. In Delhi, the contrast between the poor and the wealthy is made even more evident by their proximity to one another.

One night Pinky Madam takes the wheel from Balram, while drunk, hits something in the road and drives away; we are left to assume that she has killed a child. Ashok's family puts pressure on Balram to confess that he had been driving alone. Ashok becomes increasingly involved in bribing government officials for the benefit of the family coal business. Balram then decides that killing Ashok will be the only way to escape India's Rooster Coop. After bludgeoning Ashok with a bottle and stealing a large bribe, Balram moves to Bangalore, where he bribes the police in order to help start his own taxi business. Ashok too is portrayed to be trapped in the metaphorical Rooster Coop: his family controls what he does and society dictates how he acts. Just like Ashok, Balram pays off a family whose son one of his taxi drivers hit and killed. Balram explains that his own family was almost certainly killed by Ashok's relatives as retribution for his murder. At the end of the novel, Balram rationalizes his actions and considers that his freedom is worth the lives of his family and of Ashok. And thus ends the letter to Jiabao, letting the reader think of the dark humour of the tale, as well as the idea of life as a trap introduced by the writer.(wiki)",The White Tiger,Aravind Adiga, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789352645060,"Reprinted,2017",324,India,English

Pointing to the horizon where the sea and sky are joined, he says, ‘It is only an illusion because they can’t really meet, but isn’t it beautiful, this union which isn’t really there.’ – SAADAT HASAN MANTO Sometime in 2016, a series of dialogues took place which set out to find a meeting ground, even if only an illusion, between A.S. Dulat and Asad Durrani. One was a former chief of RAW, India’s external intelligence agency, the other of ISI, its Pakistani counterpart. As they could not meet in their home countries, the conversations, guided by journalist Aditya Sinha, took place in cities like Istanbul, Bangkok and Kathmandu. On the table were subjects that have long haunted South Asia, flashpoints that take lives regularly. It was in all ways a deep dive into the politics of the subcontinent, as seen through the eyes of two spymasters. Among the subjects: Kashmir, and a missed opportunity for peace; Hafiz Saeed and 26/11; Kulbhushan Jadhav; surgical strikes; the deal for Osama bin Laden; how the US and Russia feature in the India-Pakistan relationship; and how terror undermines the two countries’ attempts at talks. When the project was first mooted, General Durrani laughed and said nobody would believe it even if it was written as fiction. At a time of fraught relations, this unlikely dialogue between two former spy chiefs from opposite sides-a project that is the first of its kind-may well provide some answers.

How is it, then, that today the former British colonial trading post is a thriving Asian metropolis with not only the world's number one airline, best airport, and busiest port of trade, but also the world's fourth–highest per capita real income?

The story of that transformation is told here by Singapore's charismatic, controversial founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. Rising from a legacy of divisive colonialism, the devastation of the Second World War, and general poverty and disorder following the withdrawal of foreign forces, Singapore now is hailed as a city of the future. This miraculous history is dramatically recounted by the man who not only lived through it all but who fearlessly forged ahead and brought about most of these changes.

Delving deep into his own meticulous notes, as well as previously unpublished government papers and official records, Lee details the extraordinary efforts it took for an island city–state in Southeast Asia to survive at that time.

Lee explains how he and his cabinet colleagues finished off the communist threat to the fledgling state's security and began the arduous process of nation building: forging basic infrastructural roads through a land that still consisted primarily of swamps, creating an army from a hitherto racially and ideologically divided population, stamping out the last vestiges of colonial–era corruption, providing mass public housing, and establishing a national airline and airport.

In this illuminating account, Lee writes frankly about his trenchant approach to political opponents and his often unorthodox views on human rights, democracy, and inherited intelligence, aiming always ""to be correct, not politically correct."" Nothing in Singapore escaped his watchful eye: whether choosing shrubs for the greening of the country, restoring the romance of the historic Raffles Hotel, or openly, unabashedly persuading young men to marry women as well educated as themselves. Today's safe, tidy Singapore bears Lee's unmistakable stamp, for which he is unapologetic: ""If this is a nanny state, I am proud to have fostered one.""

Though Lee's domestic canvas in Singapore was small, his vigor and talent assured him a larger place in world affairs. With inimitable style, he brings history to life with cogent analyses of some of the greatest strategic issues of recent times and reveals how, over the years, he navigated the shifting tides of relations among America, China, and Taiwan, acting as confidant, sounding board, and messenger for them. He also includes candid, sometimes acerbic pen portraits of his political peers, including the indomitable Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, the poetry–spouting Jiang Zemin, and ideologues George Bush and Deng Xiaoping.

Lee also lifts the veil on his family life and writes tenderly of his wife and stalwart partner, Kwa Geok Choo, and of their pride in their three children –– particularly the eldest son, Hsien Loong, who is now Singapore's deputy prime minister.

For more than three decades, Lee Kuan Yew has been praised and vilified in equal measure, and he has established himself as a force impossible to ignore in Asian and international politics. From Third World to First offers readers a compelling glimpse into this visionary's heart, soul, and mind.",From Third World to First,Lee Kuan Yew, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780060197766,1st Edition,752,Abroad,English

Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain. 

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end. 
This novel has been greatly appreciated by its readers, being labeled as the most important book of the 20th century by the Children’s Books Of The Century poll, published in Books For Keeps. Although the exact number is not known, there have been 35-100 million copies of The Hobbit sold, till date, since it’s publishing in the year 1937. The Hobbit has also been adapted into a movie, whose first part, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey released in the United States on the 14th of December 2012. This movie was directed by Peter Jackson, and the second, and third parts are scheduled to release in 2013, and 2014.

A prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity set in the Sundarbans, an immense labyrinth of tiny islands on the easternmost coast of India.

The Hungry Tide is a very contemporary story of adventure and unlikely love, identity and history, set in one of the most fascinating regions on the earth. Off the easternmost coast of India, in the Bay of Bengal, lies the immense labyrinth of tiny islands known as the Sundarbans. 

For settlers here, life is extremely precarious. Attacks by deadly tigers are common. Unrest and eviction are constant threats. Without warning, at any time, tidal floods rise and surge over the land, leaving devastation in their wake. In this place of vengeful beauty, the lives of three people from different worlds collide. Piya Roy is a young marine biologist, of Indian descent but stubbornly American, in search of a rare, endangered river dolphin. 

Her journey begins with a disaster, when she is thrown from a boat into crocodile-infested waters. Rescue comes in the form of a young, illiterate fisherman, Fokir. Although they have no language between them, Piya and Fokir are powerfully drawn to each other, sharing an uncanny instinct for the ways of the sea. Piya engages Fokir to help with her research and finds a translator in Kanai Dutt, a businessman from Delhi whose idealistic aunt and uncle are longtime settlers in the Sundarbans. 

As the three of them launch into the elaborate backwaters, they are drawn unawares into the hidden undercurrents of this isolated world, where political turmoil exacts a personal toll that is every bit as powerful as the ravaging tide. Already an international success, The Hungry Tide is a prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity.",The Hungry Tide,Amitav Ghosh, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780007432974,"1st Edition,2004",403,Abroad,English

Sidney Sheldon’s Tell Me Your Dreams introduces three very different women at the onset of the novel. Introduced first is Ashley Peterson, a beautiful young woman who works for a computer company in Silicon Valley. Ashley is single and convinced she is being stalked. Readers next meet Ashley’s co-workers, Toni and Alette. Toni Prescott, a British woman in her early twenties is rather bold and striking. Rounding out the trio is Alette Peters, a quiet, dreamy romantic who moved to California from Rome. In the early stages of the novel, quite a few murders are committed and police in Chicago, San Francisco, and Quebec are desperate to solve the gruesome crimes that have taken place in each of their cities. Conclusive evidence points to one suspect and one suspect alone.

As the story develops, the reader learns why Ashley feels so alone in the world. She is the only child of a world-famous heart surgeon, who is often critical and overbearing. Although Ashley loves her father, she does not necessarily love his company and tries to avoid him. Toni is a provocateur with a penchant for song who suffered a strained relationship with her mother. Alette is a gifted artist who lacks self-confidence. As the novel draws to a conclusion, Ashley, Toni, and Alette are proven to be one in the same.

The reader will not be disappointed with Sheldon’s storytelling upon finishing this book. Sheldon provides a fascinating and precise examination of the different aspects of multiple personality disorder through the characters of Ashley, Toni, and Alette. He expertly draws the reader into his story, just as a fly is drawn into a spider’s web. Although this novel was a great effort, it is not one of Sheldon’s best—as portions of the plot are predictable. Sheldon’s ending, however, does have some panache.

The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was Christie’s sixth novel and was published in 1926. It was the third novel that featured the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Like many of her other novels, the book is set in a small town and focuses on the interactions between characters who are well known to one another.

When the novel was first published, critical reactions were mixed because of the unusual narrative structure. Christie chose to have the murderer tell the story from his point of view. This device caused some consternation because some believed that Christie was not “playing fair” with her readers. They reasoned that, in crime fiction, if the novel is to be fair, the reader should be able to follow the same path the detective does in order to solve the crime. Some believed that by having the narrator as the murderer, the reader would not be able to follow the path of the clues, since the murderer would, in order to protect his identity, conceal certain key pieces of information.

Christie circumvents this problem in several ways. First, Dr. Sheppard is an extremely believable character. Because of the remorseful tone he assumes at the beginning of the novel, the reader immediately trusts him and his observations. In addition, Poirot appears to trust Sheppard, including him in discussions with the police and, as Poirot admits, using Sheppard as a substitute for Captain Hastings, who had played Dr. Watson to Poirot’s Sherlock Holmes in previous novels. Thus, the reader is led to trust Sheppard because Poirot trusts him.

Sheppard also establishes an intimate rapport with the reader through the use of first-person narrative. The reader is privy to what are assumed to be the doctor’s private thoughts about Ackroyd’s murder. Poirot also confides in Sheppard and often asks his opinion of people within the town. Again, this action on the part of Christie serves to inspire confidence in the narrator; the reader does not suspect him because Poirot does not, and because Christie has, as in previous novels, established Poirot as a reliable source and a good judge of human nature.

Another aspect to the novel in regard to the narration is the comparatively small role that Poirot plays. The reader is accustomed to seeing him as the main character—almost as a master puppeteer who guides the movements of all around him. In fact, the readers expect Poirot to manipulate them, for this is the nature of crime fiction in general: The reader is manipulated by the detective to see things his or her way. Christie, however, chooses to radically depart from this formula. Instead of Poirot manipulating the reader, Sheppard manipulates both the reader and Poirot. The reader is unaware of this subterfuge, however, until the end of the novel, when all the other probable suspects have been eliminated and only Sheppard remains. The reader is then privy to Sheppard’s confession, and all the pieces to this very complex puzzle fall into place.

We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.

What’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.

Now, in Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom—and even of hope itself.

With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.",Everything Is F*cked: A Book About Hope,Mark Manson, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780062955951,"1st Published,2019",274,India,English

Hema Malini wears many hats with admirable ease. No other industry name comes close to matching the breadth of her achievements.
In an industry where the male star has traditionally driven the commercial success of films, Hema was an exception, with her name alone sufficing to ensure a film's, box-office glory. She was, arguably. India's first female superstar. Apart from starring in mainstream super-hits like Johny Mera Naam, Jugnu, Andaz, Seeta aur Geeta, Sholay and, more recently, Baghban, she received critical acclaim for her performances in Lal Patthar, Khushboo, Kinara, Meera, Ek Chadar Maili Si and Razia Sultan. But, even as she completes fifty years in cinema, there is much more to her than just her Bollywood journey.
From her efforts at reviving and sustaining classical dance to her graceful handling of her personal life and the controversies that have plagued her in her political avatar, from her relationships to her religious beliefs and her recent tryst with singing, Hema Malini: Beyond the Dream Girl covers it all.

Soon after arriving at his hotel in Istanbul, private investigator Hercule Poirot is instructed to return to London immediately. He boards the Orient Express that very night and is accosted by Mr. Ratchett, whom he had earlier seen in his hotel in Istanbul. He attempts to hire Poirot believing that his life is under threat, but the detective refuses him outright.

On the second night of the journey, a snowdrift brings the train to a halt. A cry from Ratchett’s coach pierces the eerie silence of the night. The next morning, M. Bouc, the director of the company that operates the train and an acquaintance of Poirot, informs him of the shocking murder of Ratchett. Upon his request, Poirot agrees to investigate the case. Soon Poirot learns of Ratchett’s questionable past and the probable reasons for his murder.

In the United States a few years earlier, Daisy Armstrong, a 3 year old heiress was kidnapped and killed by a man, who went by the name Cassetti, in spite of collecting a ransom from her wealthy family. Suspected to have rigged the trial, Cassetti fled the country after his acquittal. Poirot came to the conclusion that Ratchett was none other than Cassetti.

What connects the people in Ratchett’s coach who were travelling with him on that fateful night of the murder? Is one of the members of the Armstrong family the murderer?

Murder on the Orient Express has been adapted to TV, film and radio as well. The book was first published in 1934.

#1 New York Times Bestseller!

In the second book of the Carve the Mark duology, globally bestselling Divergent author Veronica Roth reveals how Cyra and Akos fulfill their fates. The Fates Divide is a richly imagined tale of hope and resilience told in four stunning perspectives.

The lives of Cyra Noavek and Akos Kereseth are ruled by their fates, spoken by the oracles at their births. The fates, once determined, are inescapable.

Akos is in love with Cyra, in spite of his fate: He will die in service to Cyra’s family. And when Cyra’s father, Lazmet Noavek—a soulless tyrant, thought to be dead—reclaims the Shotet throne, Akos believes his end is closer than ever.

As Lazmet ignites a barbaric war, Cyra and Akos are desperate to stop him at any cost. For Cyra, that could mean taking the life of the man who may—or may not—be her father. For Akos, it could mean giving his own. In a stunning twist, the two will discover how fate defines their lives in ways most unexpected.

The Fifth Mountain is set in the year 870 BC. Israel is being ruled by Phoenicians and Queen Jezebel wants to ensure that the people follow her own faith, one she brought from her native land. So, she orders the death of all those who do not bow down to her God, Baal.

One of these rebels is the Prophet Elijah. The Queen orders his death for refusing to obey her. Elijah flees to the lovely Phoenician city of Zarephath, which is also known by the Phoenician name of Akbar. This place was actually considered to be the abode of the God, though Elijah refused to acknowledge it.

There he meets a woman who is a worshipper of Baal. Though their religious views differ and she is older than him, Elijah and the woman are attracted to each other. But they don't discuss their feelings openly. Meanwhile, Elijah, who has been sent to this place by an angel, wants to rid Israel of the tyranny of Queen Jezebel.

But due to a surprising turn of events, the people of Akbar accept him as a sage. They consider him one of their own and come to him for advice and to settle disputes. As Elijah begins to bond with these people, he suffers from conflicting ambitions. He cannot decide whether to remain in Akbar, his adopted city, or to return to Israel. Subsequently, the destructive Assyrian invasion on Akbar worsens Elijah’s dilemma.
In The Fifth Mountain, through the context of a religious tale, the author conveys the importance of finding one's own destiny, even if it seems like it will involve rebelling against God's will. He insists that in doing so, one will find oneself getting closer to God.

Cards on the Table is a detective novel by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 2 November 1936 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence and the US edition at $2.00.

The book features the recurring characters of Hercule Poirot, Colonel Race, Superintendent Battle and the bumbling crime writer Ariadne Oliver, making her first appearance in a Poirot novel. The four detectives and four possible suspects play bridge after dinner with Mr Shaitana. At the end of the evening, Mr Shaitana is discovered murdered. Identifying the murderer, per Mrs Christie, depends wholly on discerning the psychology of the suspects.

This novel was well received at first printing and in later reviews. It was noted for its humour, for the subtlety of the writing, good clueing and tight writing, showing continuing improvement in the author's writing style in this, her twentieth novel. One later reviewer considered this in the top rung of her novels, and another found it to be most original, with a brilliant surprise ending.

In this compilation of eight marvellous short stories, Agatha Christie delights readers with the presence of her three male sleuths in six respective stories. Two stories each for Parker Pyne, the duo Harley Quin-Satterthwaite and Hercule Poirot ‘the police hound.’ In the two other, two women on a crossroads of their life are faced with difficult decision to make.

Presumably first appeared in the UK magazines, seven of them were written in the twenties and in the  thirties. Only The Harlequin Tea Set was in 1971. Interestingly, the copyright of five of them were signed as Mrs. Mallowan; hence after her divorce in 1928.

Poirot’s cases concern with a reconstruction of a suicide and the death of an old eccentric well-to-do man who summons the Belgian to his home. In the former story, it starts when he receives a telephone call from a mysterious woman begging for his help. ‘…table with yellow irises,’ she sounds frightened  of being overheard. In the latter, a shot is heard moments after the first gong for dinner but a guest firmly believes of having heard the second gong. Four years later the same plot appears in Dead Man’s Mirror (see Notes On The Murder In The Mews) with alterations to the character names.

In the non-detective stories, two female protagonists must make her choice. On the one hand, it is between a dog or starvation in Next To A Dog; the dog being the very memory of a dead husband. On the other, Theodora Darrel undergoes a battle of will between loyalty vs happiness. Will she still walk out from her marriage having known that her husband has been in a serious charge of theft and fraud?
The Love Detectives (1926) seems to mark the early appearance of Harley Quin; an enigmatic man of whom his path is crossed with Mr. Satterthwaite’s on a number of occasions (see Notes On The Mysterious Mr. Quin). In a dark night both meets when their car collide; Sattwerthwaite is with Colonel Melrose on their way to a crime scene. An aristocrat has been killed with a bronze figure of Venus. Then his beautiful wife and a male guest whom stays over in the house confess of the murder. Who is one to believe?

Any readers who remember Mrs. Protheroe and Lawrence Redding     will understand what  occurs next in the story (see Notes On The Murder At The Vicarage).

As the book begins, Athena is dead. How she ended up that way creates the intrigue sustaining the book. The child, Sherine Khalil renames herself Athena after her uncle was discussing with her mother on how her real name will betray her origins and something like Athena gave nothing away. As a child, she shows a strong religious vocation and reports seeing angels and saints, which both impresses and worries her parents.

She goes into a London University to pursue Engineering at the age of 19 but it's not what her heart wanted. One day she just decides that she wanted to drop out of college, get married and have a baby. Here, the author mentions that this might be due to the fact that she was abandoned herself and wants to give all that love she could to her child which she didn't receive from her birth mother. Two years later, her marriage falls apart because they are facing too many problems due to their young age and lack of money or mostly because he felt that she loved only the child and used him to get what she wanted. A very interesting quote she uses is ""From Ancient Greece on, the people who returned from battle were either dead on their shields or stronger, despite or because of their scars. It's better that way: I've lived on a battlefield since I was born, but I'm still alive and I don't need anyone to protect me."" She grows into a woman in search of answers to many questions that arise within a person. She had a life which many felt was content because she had a child of her own, money, and friends; everything but her mind was at peace, so she searches for the answer to the classical question of ""Who am I?"" through many experiences.

While Ashoke Ganguli is studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the young wife is lost in the alien land with not many around to help her and no friends she could talk to and hang out with. Now, their young boy has to be named by an elder person in the family, as a part of the tradition followed in Bengali families. This honour has been given to Ashima’s grandmother. Due to circumstances, the couple find out that they cannot leave the hospital without naming the child. Ashoke thus chooses the name of his favourite Russian author, Gogol, for time being. But when Ashima’s grandmother passes away before picking a name for her great grandson, the boy remains Gogol. Although he likes his name initially, he starts to dislike it by the time he begins going to high school. And he formally changes his name to Nikhil before leaving for higher studies, and becomes Nikhil Gogol Ganguli. Ashima is extremely unhappy with her son when he starts becoming more of an American, and Ashoke remains quiet about all this until he finds the right time to tell Gogol why he chose that name. The reason behind a name is what constitutes the soul of the story, which changes the young man forever.

Maurice Willson Disher's review in The Times Literary Supplement of 16 January 1943 concluded, ""No crime enthusiast will object that the story of how the painter died has to be told many times, for this, even if it creates an interest which is more problem than plot, demonstrates the author's uncanny skill. The answer to the riddle is brilliant.""

Maurice Richardson was pleased to see the return of Poirot to Christie's works when he reviewed the novel in the 10 January 1943 issue of The Observer. He concluded, ""Despite only five suspects, Mrs. Christie, as usual, puts a ring through the reader's nose and leads him to one of her smashing last-minute showdowns. This is well up to the standard of her middle Poirot period. No more need be said.""

J.D. Beresford in The Guardian's 20 January 1943 review, wrote: ""Miss Agatha Christie never fails us, and her Five Little Pigs presents a very pretty problem for the ingenious reader."" It concluded that the clue to who committed the crime was, ""completely satisfying.""

Robert Barnard: ""The-murder-in-the-past plot on its first and best appearance – accept no later substitutes. Presentation more intricate than usual, characterization more subtle."" All in all, it is a beautifully tailored book, rich and satisfying. The present writer would be willing to chance his arm and say that this is the best Christie of all.""

																																										Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain.

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end.

A novel rich in metaphors and symbolism, The Alchemist is a story based on the adventures of a young shepherd boy, who, upon deciding to follow his prophetic dreams, sets on a treasure hunt. This journey introduces him to some remarkable people who leave an indelible and profound mark on him.  

Summary Of The Book: 
The Alchemist was first published in 1988. The protagonist of the story, a young Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago, is plagued with recurring dreams, wherein a mysterious child urges him to look for buried treasure at the base of the Egyptian pyramids. Determined, he leaves Spain and heads towards Egypt. En route, he meets the King of Salem, a man named Melchizedek. Melchizedek introduces Santiago to the concept of a ‘Personal Legend’ or a personal map or a quest that guides him to what his heart truly desires.
While attempting to cross the Sahara desert on the way to Egypt, he joins a caravan which is driven by an Englishman who is aspiring to be an alchemist. During a stop over in Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets Fatima, a young girl of exceeding beauty who steals his heart. He asks her to marry him, but she declines saying that she will do so only once he has found the treasure he seeks. In the Saharan oasis of Al-Fayoum, Santiago meets a 200 year old alchemist who decides to accompany him on his expedition. He imparts wisdom and valuable knowledge to Santiago, who eventually understands why the supposed treasure keeps evading him.
Having sold over 65 million copies worldwide, The Alchemist is marked by its profound simplicity, the easy flow of the story, and the poignant moral it tries to teach the reader, that worldly possessions and extravagance are immaterial when compared to finding your own ‘Personal Legend’.",The Alchemist (About 150 Million Copies Sold),Paulo Coelho, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9788172234980,"1st Edition,2015",192,Abroad,English

Currently ranked World No. 1 in women's doubles, Sania Mirza became an instant sensation when she won the Wimbledon Championships girls' doubles title at the age of sixteen. From 2003 until her retirement from the singles circuit in 2012, she was ranked by the Women's Tennis Association as India's top player, both in singles and doubles. A six-time Grand Slam champion, she notched up an incredible forty-one consecutive wins with her doubles partner, Martina Hingis, between August 2015 and February 2016.

Ace against Odds is the story of this most iconic Indian player who beat incredible odds to get to the top of her sport. Sania writes with candour of the hardships along the way, of the physical and emotional trauma caused by injuries and medical procedures, of the friends and partners who became her mainstay along with her family, of the pressures of constant public scrutiny and, not least, the politics and heartbreaks that inevitably accompany success.

Sania broke the rules, she spoke her mind, she pushed herself to the limit, she played for India fiercely and without care for how it might impact her rankings - she is and will continue to remain an inspiration long after she steps off the tennis courts.(goodreads.com)",Ace Against Odds,Sania Mirza, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789351362630,"1st Edition,2016",288,India,English

Looking For Alaska, John Green’s debut novel was first published in 2005. Looking For Alaska follows the life of Miles Halter, as he leaves Florida to join boarding school in Alabama. He joins Culver Creek, the boarding school, later than usual, as he himself mentions that he is looking for a “Great Perhaps”.

Among his quirks include memorizing the last words of famous people and the “Great Perhaps” was that of Francois Rabelais. Miles receives the nickname Pudge in school, and though his was a figure that was nothing like the name entailed, it stuck.

His roommate and friend is Chip, who is the person who introduces him to Alaska Young, the Alaska mentioned in the title of the story. The adventures that they are involved in together cause him to fall in love with Alaska, and the entire book is written in first person. Most of the book is written as a countdown to a specific occurrence, which occurs in the rest of the book and it is easy to gather from the title, what this section would cover.

Though mostly mature and insightful, readers often get a peek into the sex addled mind of a sixteen year old school student, one who is forever counting the number of layers of clothing separating him from the bare body of the girl he is presently with.

Looking For Alaska won the 2006 Michael L. Printz Award from the American Library Association. It broke into the New York Times Bestseller list at number 10 in 2012, much after its debut in 2005. The film rights to the book have been sold to Paramount Pictures, though the project hasn’t been greenlighted yet due to lack of sufficient interest.

Hercule Poirot finds himself the uninvited guest at the scene of an elaborately planned murder on wheels. The Belgian detective is making his way from Istanbul, Turkey, to London, and he is looking forward to a leisurely trip and a chance to clear his head, a chance to rest his “little grey cells,” as Poirot refers to his brain.

A good friend of Poirot, M. Bouc, is an administrator with Wagon Lit, the train company that operates the Orient Express. Poirot prefers to travel first class. Because it is winter, off season for tourists, the detective is assured by Bouc that finding a first-class cabin on the train will be easy. To their surprise, the car leaving Istanbul, the Calais Coach, is nearly full. There is, however, one no-show, and Poirot finds himself sharing a compartment with Hector MacQueen, the private secretary to a wealthy American, Mr. Ratchett.

Poirot is introduced by Bouc to Dr. Constantine, a Greek physician, traveling in the next car. On the first night of the journey, as they sit in the dining car, Bouc points out to Poirot the variety of travelers in the dining car: the rich and the poor. Some are English, some American, some French, some Italian, some Russian, some Hungarian—an array of passengers from differing socioeconomic backgrounds and different cultures. Where else in the world, Bouc wonders aloud, could one find such an assortment of people beneath one roof? Yes, Poirot thinks to himself, perhaps only in America.

The first night passes peacefully, and Bouc moves Poirot from his shared cabin with MacQueen to a private one next door to Ratchett. During the second night of the trip, Poirot has trouble sleeping, awakened by voices, service bells summoning conductor Pierre Michel, and thumping on his cabin door. At about 1:15 a.m., Poirot sticks his head out of his cabin and sees a woman wearing a kimono with a dragon print walking down the corridor. He hears his neighbor, Ratchett, tell the conductor in perfect French that nothing is wrong and that he had not meant to ring his service bell. The train is stopped, too, as an avalanche of snow covers the tracks.

Ratchett, Poirot has determined, is an evil man. The evil shows on his face, and Poirot has taken an instant dislike in him. Earlier in the evening, Poirot had been approached by Ratchett and was offered a job—to keep Ratchett alive. Ratchett has been receiving hate mail and otherwise threatening letters.

This book, Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges, takes up the story from when A.P.J Abdul Kalam became the President of India. It covers his acceptance of the post of the President of India, his term in office, his efforts to make his term meaningful, and the challenges he faced.

His term from 2002 to 2007 was an eventful one. The President of India is just a titular head with minimal powers. But, the office is one of great influence and Kalam used it to best effect. He got the government and the public to focus on issues that were relevant to the country's all round growth.

He initiated programs like PURA to try and integrate rural areas into the general economic and technological growth of the country. He dreamt of taking the whole of India on his vision for the country in the new millennium, and he saw no reason why the villages should be left out in this vision.

Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges is more about Kalam’s vision for his country rather than about himself. He tries to provide a blueprint for development, and for reforms in the government and judiciary.

Dr.Kalam is a strong advocate for the use of technology and a proponent of e-governance. Even the little bits of personal experience during his term that he gives, he links with these ideas. For instance, he mentions the controversial dissolution of the Bihar assembly for which he later offered to resign. But, he does not focus on the political or personal implications of this decision, instead, he chose to highlight his use of electronic communication in lending his approval to this move, for he was in Moscow at that time.

He made the office of the President accessible to the public. He used his popularity and high visibility to inspire the youth of the country and convince them to believe in his 2020 vision for India. He urged the young people to dream big, and to believe in their country's destiny. Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges describes the term in office of one of the most charismatic Presidents of the country.

Winning, published in 2010, is a self-help management guide to help readers find answers to some of the most difficult questions of their professional lives. Winning starts off with an introduction, where Jack Welch says that the most commonly asked question is, What does it take to win?

The first part of the book, Underneath It All, describes Jack’s management philosophy. The author says that an organization should take ideas from every level, and not just the top leaders.

Winning also says that maintaining a good work-life balance is essential. The last part, Tying Up Loose Ends, answers nine questions that do not fall in the above categories, like managing the China threat.

Winning is filled with personal stories and experiences, and has been written with a no-nonsense attitude. This book offers no easy solutions on how to win, as there really are none.

Balram Halwai narrates his life in a letter, written in seven consecutive nights and addressed to the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao. In his letter, Balram explains how he, the son of a puller, escaped a life of servitude to become a successful businessman, describing himself as an entrepreneur.

Balram was born in the rural village of Laxmangarh, where he lived with his grandmother, parents, brother and extended family. He is a smart child but is forced to leave school in order to help pay for his cousin's dowry and begins to work in a teashop with his brother in Dhanbad. While working there he begins to learn about India's government and economy from the customers' conversations. Balram describes himself as a bad servant but a good listener and decides to become a driver.

After learning how to drive, Balram finds a job driving Ashok, the son of one of Laxmangarh's landlords. He takes over the job of the main driver, from a small car to a heavy-luxury described Honda City. He stops sending money back to his family and disrespects his grandmother during a trip back to his village. Balram moves to New Delhi with Ashok and his wife Pinky Madam. Throughout their time in Delhi, Balram is exposed to extensive corruption, especially in the government. In Delhi, the contrast between the poor and the wealthy is made even more evident by their proximity to one another.

One night Pinky Madam takes the wheel from Balram, while drunk, hits something in the road and drives away; we are left to assume that she has killed a child. Ashok's family puts pressure on Balram to confess that he had been driving alone. Ashok becomes increasingly involved in bribing government officials for the benefit of the family coal business. Balram then decides that killing Ashok will be the only way to escape India's Rooster Coop. After bludgeoning Ashok with a bottle and stealing a large bribe, Balram moves to Bangalore, where he bribes the police in order to help start his own taxi business. Ashok too is portrayed to be trapped in the metaphorical Rooster Coop: his family controls what he does and society dictates how he acts. Just like Ashok, Balram pays off a family whose son one of his taxi drivers hit and killed. Balram explains that his own family was almost certainly killed by Ashok's relatives as retribution for his murder. At the end of the novel, Balram rationalizes his actions and considers that his freedom is worth the lives of his family and of Ashok. And thus ends the letter to Jiabao, letting the reader think of the dark humour of the tale, as well as the idea of life as a trap introduced by the writer.(wiki)",The White Tiger,Aravind Adiga, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9789352645060,"Reprinted,2017",324,India,English

Pointing to the horizon where the sea and sky are joined, he says, ‘It is only an illusion because they can’t really meet, but isn’t it beautiful, this union which isn’t really there.’ – SAADAT HASAN MANTO Sometime in 2016, a series of dialogues took place which set out to find a meeting ground, even if only an illusion, between A.S. Dulat and Asad Durrani. One was a former chief of RAW, India’s external intelligence agency, the other of ISI, its Pakistani counterpart. As they could not meet in their home countries, the conversations, guided by journalist Aditya Sinha, took place in cities like Istanbul, Bangkok and Kathmandu. On the table were subjects that have long haunted South Asia, flashpoints that take lives regularly. It was in all ways a deep dive into the politics of the subcontinent, as seen through the eyes of two spymasters. Among the subjects: Kashmir, and a missed opportunity for peace; Hafiz Saeed and 26/11; Kulbhushan Jadhav; surgical strikes; the deal for Osama bin Laden; how the US and Russia feature in the India-Pakistan relationship; and how terror undermines the two countries’ attempts at talks. When the project was first mooted, General Durrani laughed and said nobody would believe it even if it was written as fiction. At a time of fraught relations, this unlikely dialogue between two former spy chiefs from opposite sides-a project that is the first of its kind-may well provide some answers.

How is it, then, that today the former British colonial trading post is a thriving Asian metropolis with not only the world's number one airline, best airport, and busiest port of trade, but also the world's fourth–highest per capita real income?

The story of that transformation is told here by Singapore's charismatic, controversial founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. Rising from a legacy of divisive colonialism, the devastation of the Second World War, and general poverty and disorder following the withdrawal of foreign forces, Singapore now is hailed as a city of the future. This miraculous history is dramatically recounted by the man who not only lived through it all but who fearlessly forged ahead and brought about most of these changes.

Delving deep into his own meticulous notes, as well as previously unpublished government papers and official records, Lee details the extraordinary efforts it took for an island city–state in Southeast Asia to survive at that time.

Lee explains how he and his cabinet colleagues finished off the communist threat to the fledgling state's security and began the arduous process of nation building: forging basic infrastructural roads through a land that still consisted primarily of swamps, creating an army from a hitherto racially and ideologically divided population, stamping out the last vestiges of colonial–era corruption, providing mass public housing, and establishing a national airline and airport.

In this illuminating account, Lee writes frankly about his trenchant approach to political opponents and his often unorthodox views on human rights, democracy, and inherited intelligence, aiming always ""to be correct, not politically correct."" Nothing in Singapore escaped his watchful eye: whether choosing shrubs for the greening of the country, restoring the romance of the historic Raffles Hotel, or openly, unabashedly persuading young men to marry women as well educated as themselves. Today's safe, tidy Singapore bears Lee's unmistakable stamp, for which he is unapologetic: ""If this is a nanny state, I am proud to have fostered one.""

Though Lee's domestic canvas in Singapore was small, his vigor and talent assured him a larger place in world affairs. With inimitable style, he brings history to life with cogent analyses of some of the greatest strategic issues of recent times and reveals how, over the years, he navigated the shifting tides of relations among America, China, and Taiwan, acting as confidant, sounding board, and messenger for them. He also includes candid, sometimes acerbic pen portraits of his political peers, including the indomitable Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, the poetry–spouting Jiang Zemin, and ideologues George Bush and Deng Xiaoping.

Lee also lifts the veil on his family life and writes tenderly of his wife and stalwart partner, Kwa Geok Choo, and of their pride in their three children –– particularly the eldest son, Hsien Loong, who is now Singapore's deputy prime minister.

For more than three decades, Lee Kuan Yew has been praised and vilified in equal measure, and he has established himself as a force impossible to ignore in Asian and international politics. From Third World to First offers readers a compelling glimpse into this visionary's heart, soul, and mind.",From Third World to First,Lee Kuan Yew, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780060197766,1st Edition,752,Abroad,English

Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain. 

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end. 
This novel has been greatly appreciated by its readers, being labeled as the most important book of the 20th century by the Children’s Books Of The Century poll, published in Books For Keeps. Although the exact number is not known, there have been 35-100 million copies of The Hobbit sold, till date, since it’s publishing in the year 1937. The Hobbit has also been adapted into a movie, whose first part, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey released in the United States on the 14th of December 2012. This movie was directed by Peter Jackson, and the second, and third parts are scheduled to release in 2013, and 2014.

A prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity set in the Sundarbans, an immense labyrinth of tiny islands on the easternmost coast of India.

The Hungry Tide is a very contemporary story of adventure and unlikely love, identity and history, set in one of the most fascinating regions on the earth. Off the easternmost coast of India, in the Bay of Bengal, lies the immense labyrinth of tiny islands known as the Sundarbans. 

For settlers here, life is extremely precarious. Attacks by deadly tigers are common. Unrest and eviction are constant threats. Without warning, at any time, tidal floods rise and surge over the land, leaving devastation in their wake. In this place of vengeful beauty, the lives of three people from different worlds collide. Piya Roy is a young marine biologist, of Indian descent but stubbornly American, in search of a rare, endangered river dolphin. 

Her journey begins with a disaster, when she is thrown from a boat into crocodile-infested waters. Rescue comes in the form of a young, illiterate fisherman, Fokir. Although they have no language between them, Piya and Fokir are powerfully drawn to each other, sharing an uncanny instinct for the ways of the sea. Piya engages Fokir to help with her research and finds a translator in Kanai Dutt, a businessman from Delhi whose idealistic aunt and uncle are longtime settlers in the Sundarbans. 

As the three of them launch into the elaborate backwaters, they are drawn unawares into the hidden undercurrents of this isolated world, where political turmoil exacts a personal toll that is every bit as powerful as the ravaging tide. Already an international success, The Hungry Tide is a prophetic novel of remarkable insight, beauty, and humanity.",The Hungry Tide,Amitav Ghosh, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780007432974,"1st Edition,2004",403,Abroad,English

Sidney Sheldon’s Tell Me Your Dreams introduces three very different women at the onset of the novel. Introduced first is Ashley Peterson, a beautiful young woman who works for a computer company in Silicon Valley. Ashley is single and convinced she is being stalked. Readers next meet Ashley’s co-workers, Toni and Alette. Toni Prescott, a British woman in her early twenties is rather bold and striking. Rounding out the trio is Alette Peters, a quiet, dreamy romantic who moved to California from Rome. In the early stages of the novel, quite a few murders are committed and police in Chicago, San Francisco, and Quebec are desperate to solve the gruesome crimes that have taken place in each of their cities. Conclusive evidence points to one suspect and one suspect alone.

As the story develops, the reader learns why Ashley feels so alone in the world. She is the only child of a world-famous heart surgeon, who is often critical and overbearing. Although Ashley loves her father, she does not necessarily love his company and tries to avoid him. Toni is a provocateur with a penchant for song who suffered a strained relationship with her mother. Alette is a gifted artist who lacks self-confidence. As the novel draws to a conclusion, Ashley, Toni, and Alette are proven to be one in the same.

The reader will not be disappointed with Sheldon’s storytelling upon finishing this book. Sheldon provides a fascinating and precise examination of the different aspects of multiple personality disorder through the characters of Ashley, Toni, and Alette. He expertly draws the reader into his story, just as a fly is drawn into a spider’s web. Although this novel was a great effort, it is not one of Sheldon’s best—as portions of the plot are predictable. Sheldon’s ending, however, does have some panache.

The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd,আগাথা ক্রিস্টি,"",TK. 538,https://rokomari.com//book/129560/the-murder-of-roger-ackroyd,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/5db93ac69_129560.jpg,"'The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd' Summary of the book
The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was Christie’s sixth novel and was published in 1926. It was the third novel that featured the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Like many of her other novels, the book is set in a small town and focuses on the interactions between characters who are well known to one another.

When the novel was first published, critical reactions were mixed because of the unusual narrative structure. Christie chose to have the murderer tell the story from his point of view. This device caused some consternation because some believed that Christie was not “playing fair” with her readers. They reasoned that, in crime fiction, if the novel is to be fair, the reader should be able to follow the same path the detective does in order to solve the crime. Some believed that by having the narrator as the murderer, the reader would not be able to follow the path of the clues, since the murderer would, in order to protect his identity, conceal certain key pieces of information.

Christie circumvents this problem in several ways. First, Dr. Sheppard is an extremely believable character. Because of the remorseful tone he assumes at the beginning of the novel, the reader immediately trusts him and his observations. In addition, Poirot appears to trust Sheppard, including him in discussions with the police and, as Poirot admits, using Sheppard as a substitute for Captain Hastings, who had played Dr. Watson to Poirot’s Sherlock Holmes in previous novels. Thus, the reader is led to trust Sheppard because Poirot trusts him.

Sheppard also establishes an intimate rapport with the reader through the use of first-person narrative. The reader is privy to what are assumed to be the doctor’s private thoughts about Ackroyd’s murder. Poirot also confides in Sheppard and often asks his opinion of people within the town. Again, this action on the part of Christie serves to inspire confidence in the narrator; the reader does not suspect him because Poirot does not, and because Christie has, as in previous novels, established Poirot as a reliable source and a good judge of human nature.

Another aspect to the novel in regard to the narration is the comparatively small role that Poirot plays. The reader is accustomed to seeing him as the main character—almost as a master puppeteer who guides the movements of all around him. In fact, the readers expect Poirot to manipulate them, for this is the nature of crime fiction in general: The reader is manipulated by the detective to see things his or her way. Christie, however, chooses to radically depart from this formula. Instead of Poirot manipulating the reader, Sheppard manipulates both the reader and Poirot. The reader is unaware of this subterfuge, however, until the end of the novel, when all the other probable suspects have been eliminated and only Sheppard remains. The reader is then privy to Sheppard’s confession, and all the pieces to this very complex puzzle fall into place.

We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.

What’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.

Now, in Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom—and even of hope itself.

With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.",Everything Is F*cked: A Book About Hope,Mark Manson, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780062955951,"1st Published,2019",274,India,English

Soon after arriving at his hotel in Istanbul, private investigator Hercule Poirot is instructed to return to London immediately. He boards the Orient Express that very night and is accosted by Mr. Ratchett, whom he had earlier seen in his hotel in Istanbul. He attempts to hire Poirot believing that his life is under threat, but the detective refuses him outright.

On the second night of the journey, a snowdrift brings the train to a halt. A cry from Ratchett’s coach pierces the eerie silence of the night. The next morning, M. Bouc, the director of the company that operates the train and an acquaintance of Poirot, informs him of the shocking murder of Ratchett. Upon his request, Poirot agrees to investigate the case. Soon Poirot learns of Ratchett’s questionable past and the probable reasons for his murder.

In the United States a few years earlier, Daisy Armstrong, a 3 year old heiress was kidnapped and killed by a man, who went by the name Cassetti, in spite of collecting a ransom from her wealthy family. Suspected to have rigged the trial, Cassetti fled the country after his acquittal. Poirot came to the conclusion that Ratchett was none other than Cassetti.

What connects the people in Ratchett’s coach who were travelling with him on that fateful night of the murder? Is one of the members of the Armstrong family the murderer?

Murder on the Orient Express has been adapted to TV, film and radio as well. The book was first published in 1934.

About Agatha Christie

Agatha Christie was a crime novelist and short story writer, who also wrote plays.

Among the many novels that she has written are best-sellers like Hickory Dickory Dock, Cat Among The Pigeons, By The Pricking Of My Thumbs, Curtain, Sleeping Murder, While the Light Lasts and Other Stories, Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories, and The Regatta Mystery and Other Stories.

Agatha Christie is considered to be the best writer of crime fiction and murder mysteries till date. Her writing reflects strongly of her love of the mysterious and mystical with ceremonies and religious sects playing a large role in the settings of her plots. She has also been inspired to a great extent by the time she spent in archaeological field seasons in the Middle East as a result of which some of her writing includes extreme details of temples and excavation sites.

Agatha Christie was born on 15 September, 1890, to a wealthy family in Torquay, Devon. Prior to marrying and starting a family in London, she served in a hospital at the time of the World War I. She is listed on the Guinness Book of World Records as the best-selling novelist of all time. The publication of her first novel in 1920 featuring her most famous character Hercule Poirot kick started her writing career.

#1 New York Times Bestseller!

In the second book of the Carve the Mark duology, globally bestselling Divergent author Veronica Roth reveals how Cyra and Akos fulfill their fates. The Fates Divide is a richly imagined tale of hope and resilience told in four stunning perspectives.

The lives of Cyra Noavek and Akos Kereseth are ruled by their fates, spoken by the oracles at their births. The fates, once determined, are inescapable.

Akos is in love with Cyra, in spite of his fate: He will die in service to Cyra’s family. And when Cyra’s father, Lazmet Noavek—a soulless tyrant, thought to be dead—reclaims the Shotet throne, Akos believes his end is closer than ever.

As Lazmet ignites a barbaric war, Cyra and Akos are desperate to stop him at any cost. For Cyra, that could mean taking the life of the man who may—or may not—be her father. For Akos, it could mean giving his own. In a stunning twist, the two will discover how fate defines their lives in ways most unexpected.

The Fifth Mountain is set in the year 870 BC. Israel is being ruled by Phoenicians and Queen Jezebel wants to ensure that the people follow her own faith, one she brought from her native land. So, she orders the death of all those who do not bow down to her God, Baal.

One of these rebels is the Prophet Elijah. The Queen orders his death for refusing to obey her. Elijah flees to the lovely Phoenician city of Zarephath, which is also known by the Phoenician name of Akbar. This place was actually considered to be the abode of the God, though Elijah refused to acknowledge it.

There he meets a woman who is a worshipper of Baal. Though their religious views differ and she is older than him, Elijah and the woman are attracted to each other. But they don't discuss their feelings openly. Meanwhile, Elijah, who has been sent to this place by an angel, wants to rid Israel of the tyranny of Queen Jezebel.

But due to a surprising turn of events, the people of Akbar accept him as a sage. They consider him one of their own and come to him for advice and to settle disputes. As Elijah begins to bond with these people, he suffers from conflicting ambitions. He cannot decide whether to remain in Akbar, his adopted city, or to return to Israel. Subsequently, the destructive Assyrian invasion on Akbar worsens Elijah’s dilemma.
In The Fifth Mountain, through the context of a religious tale, the author conveys the importance of finding one's own destiny, even if it seems like it will involve rebelling against God's will. He insists that in doing so, one will find oneself getting closer to God.

Cards on the Table is a detective novel by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 2 November 1936 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence and the US edition at $2.00.

The book features the recurring characters of Hercule Poirot, Colonel Race, Superintendent Battle and the bumbling crime writer Ariadne Oliver, making her first appearance in a Poirot novel. The four detectives and four possible suspects play bridge after dinner with Mr Shaitana. At the end of the evening, Mr Shaitana is discovered murdered. Identifying the murderer, per Mrs Christie, depends wholly on discerning the psychology of the suspects.

This novel was well received at first printing and in later reviews. It was noted for its humour, for the subtlety of the writing, good clueing and tight writing, showing continuing improvement in the author's writing style in this, her twentieth novel. One later reviewer considered this in the top rung of her novels, and another found it to be most original, with a brilliant surprise ending.

In this compilation of eight marvellous short stories, Agatha Christie delights readers with the presence of her three male sleuths in six respective stories. Two stories each for Parker Pyne, the duo Harley Quin-Satterthwaite and Hercule Poirot ‘the police hound.’ In the two other, two women on a crossroads of their life are faced with difficult decision to make.


The map of Majorca, Spain where Parker Pyne has to resolve a rift between two women while on holiday.

Presumably first appeared in the UK magazines, seven of them were written in the twenties and in the  thirties. Only The Harlequin Tea Set was in 1971. Interestingly, the copyright of five of them were signed as Mrs. Mallowan; hence after her divorce in 1928.

Poirot’s cases concern with a reconstruction of a suicide and the death of an old eccentric well-to-do man who summons the Belgian to his home. In the former story, it starts when he receives a telephone call from a mysterious woman begging for his help. ‘…table with yellow irises,’ she sounds frightened  of being overheard. In the latter, a shot is heard moments after the first gong for dinner but a guest firmly believes of having heard the second gong. Four years later the same plot appears in Dead Man’s Mirror (see Notes On The Murder In The Mews) with alterations to the character names.

In the non-detective stories, two female protagonists must make her choice. On the one hand, it is between a dog or starvation in Next To A Dog; the dog being the very memory of a dead husband. On the other, Theodora Darrel undergoes a battle of will between loyalty vs happiness. Will she still walk out from her marriage having known that her husband has been in a serious charge of theft and fraud?
The Love Detectives (1926) seems to mark the early appearance of Harley Quin; an enigmatic man of whom his path is crossed with Mr. Satterthwaite’s on a number of occasions (see Notes On The Mysterious Mr. Quin). In a dark night both meets when their car collide; Sattwerthwaite is with Colonel Melrose on their way to a crime scene. An aristocrat has been killed with a bronze figure of Venus. Then his beautiful wife and a male guest whom stays over in the house confess of the murder. Who is one to believe?

Any readers who remember Mrs. Protheroe and Lawrence Redding     will understand what  occurs next in the story (see Notes On The Murder At The Vicarage).  The clock is changed to suit the alibi of a suspect and the study also becomes where the ‘thing’ happens. In Miss Marple’s case, however, the deceased’s wife and her

As the book begins, Athena is dead. How she ended up that way creates the intrigue sustaining the book. The child, Sherine Khalil renames herself Athena after her uncle was discussing with her mother on how her real name will betray her origins and something like Athena gave nothing away. As a child, she shows a strong religious vocation and reports seeing angels and saints, which both impresses and worries her parents.

She goes into a London University to pursue Engineering at the age of 19 but it's not what her heart wanted. One day she just decides that she wanted to drop out of college, get married and have a baby. Here, the author mentions that this might be due to the fact that she was abandoned herself and wants to give all that love she could to her child which she didn't receive from her birth mother. Two years later, her marriage falls apart because they are facing too many problems due to their young age and lack of money or mostly because he felt that she loved only the child and used him to get what she wanted. A very interesting quote she uses is ""From Ancient Greece on, the people who returned from battle were either dead on their shields or stronger, despite or because of their scars. It's better that way: I've lived on a battlefield since I was born, but I'm still alive and I don't need anyone to protect me."" She grows into a woman in search of answers to many questions that arise within a person. She had a life which many felt was content because she had a child of her own, money, and friends; everything but her mind was at peace, so she searches for the answer to the classical question of ""Who am I?"" through many experiences.

Ashoke Ganguli and Ashima Ganguli, a couple away from their home in Bengal, are about to have their first child in Massachusetts. While Ashoke Ganguli is studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the young wife is lost in the alien land with not many around to help her and no friends she could talk to and hang out with. Now, their young boy has to be named by an elder person in the family, as a part of the tradition followed in Bengali families. This honour has been given to Ashima’s grandmother. Due to circumstances, the couple find out that they cannot leave the hospital without naming the child. Ashoke thus chooses the name of his favourite Russian author, Gogol, for time being. But when Ashima’s grandmother passes away before picking a name for her great grandson, the boy remains Gogol. Although he likes his name initially, he starts to dislike it by the time he begins going to high school. And he formally changes his name to Nikhil before leaving for higher studies, and becomes Nikhil Gogol Ganguli. Ashima is extremely unhappy with her son when he starts becoming more of an American, and Ashoke remains quiet about all this until he finds the right time to tell Gogol why he chose that name. The reason behind a name is what constitutes the soul of the story, which changes the young man forever. This timeless story will certainly leave in thoughts that overwhelm you each time you recall it.

The answer to the riddle is brilliant.""

Maurice Richardson was pleased to see the return of Poirot to Christie's works when he reviewed the novel in the 10 January 1943 issue of The Observer. He concluded, ""Despite only five suspects, Mrs. Christie, as usual, puts a ring through the reader's nose and leads him to one of her smashing last-minute showdowns. This is well up to the standard of her middle Poirot period. No more need be said.""

J.D. Beresford in The Guardian's 20 January 1943 review, wrote: ""Miss Agatha Christie never fails us, and her Five Little Pigs presents a very pretty problem for the ingenious reader."" It concluded that the clue to who committed the crime was, ""completely satisfying.""

Robert Barnard: ""The-murder-in-the-past plot on its first and best appearance – accept no later substitutes. Presentation more intricate than usual, characterization more subtle.""

																																										Summary Of The Book

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel that begins with introducing the readers to Gandalf, who is successful in tricking Bilbo into having a party. This party is intended for Thorin, and his gang of dwarves. This merry group of beings then begins to sing of gaining victory over the famed Lonely Mountain, its treasure, which is currently in the control of a dragon named Smaug. As the music slowly starts to fade, we come to know of a mysterious map, possessed by Gandalf, which can help them gain access into the Lonely Mountain.

Gandalf then suggests that Bilbo be made to carry out this expedition, and after a while Bilbo is persuaded to do so. What follows is their encounter with trolls who seek to devour them. Gandalf is however, successful in saving the dwarves from doom. Bilbo then finds himself separated from the rest of the dwarves. As he fumbles around in that territory, he comes across a ring that seems rather mysterious, and this leads to the occurrence of various other events that keep the readers glued to the end.

This novel has been greatly appreciated by its readers, being labeled as the most important book of the 20th century by the Children’s Books Of The Century poll, published in Books For Keeps. Although the exact number is not known, there have been 35-100 million copies of The Hobbit sold, till date, since it’s publishing in the year 1937.

‘Life is like a novel. It's filled with suspense. You have no idea what is going to happen until you turn the page’
Growing up in 1930s America, the young Sidney knew what it was to struggle to get by. Millions were out of work and the Sheldon family was forced to journey around America in search of employment. Grabbing every chance he could, Sidney worked nights as a bus-boy, a clerk, an usher - anything - but he dreamt of becoming something more.
His dream was to become a writer and to break into Hollywood. By a stroke of luck, he found work as a reader for David Selznick, a top Hollywood producer, and the dream began to materialise. Sheldon worked through the night writing stories for the movies, and librettos for the musical theatre. Little by little he gained a reputation and soon found himself in demand by the hottest producers and stars in Hollywood.
But this was wartime Hollywood and Sidney had to play his part. He trained as a pilot in the US Army Air Corps and waited for the call to arms which could put a stop to his dreams of stardom.",The Other Side of Me,Sidney Sheldon, , ,Harpercollins publishers,9780007228003,"12th Impression,2016",370,India,English
