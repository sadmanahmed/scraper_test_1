In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger shows us that the key to being stronger, happier people is to handle adversity better and stop trying to be ""positive” all the time.
For the past few years, Mark Manson-via his wildly popular blog-has been working on correcting our delusional expectations for ourselves and for the world. He now brings his hard-fought wisdom to this groundbreaking book.
Manson makes the argument that human beings are flawed and limited. As he writes, ""not everybody can be extraordinary-there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them-this, he says, is the real source of empowerment. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties-once we stop running from and avoiding, and start confronting, painful truths-we can begin to find the courage and confidence we desperately seek.
""In life, we have a limited amouht of fucks to give. So you must choose your fucks wisely."" Manson brings a muchneeded grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eyes moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor. This manifesto is a refreshing slap in the face for all of us, so that we can start to lead more contented, grounded lives.",The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck,Mark Manson, , ,Harperone,9780062641540,"1st Edition,2016",212,India,English

In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger shows us that the key to being stronger, happier people is to handle adversity better and stop trying to be ""positive” all the time.
For the past few years, Mark Manson-via his wildly popular blog-has been working on correcting our delusional expectations for ourselves and for the world. He now brings his hard-fought wisdom to this groundbreaking book.
Manson makes the argument that human beings are flawed and limited. As he writes, ""not everybody can be extraordinary-there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them-this, he says, is the real source of empowerment. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties-once we stop running from and avoiding, and start confronting, painful truths-we can begin to find the courage and confidence we desperately seek.
""In life, we have a limited amouht of fucks to give. So you must choose your fucks wisely."" Manson brings a muchneeded grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eyes moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor. This manifesto is a refreshing slap in the face for all of us, so that we can start to lead more contented, grounded lives.",The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck,Mark Manson, , ,Harperone,9780062641540,"1st Edition,2016",212,India,English
