A military coup is thwarted, but the exact sequence of events is shrouded in mystery. Soon after, Ayesha Begum, recovering from the birth of her second child, receives a letter from the air force stating that her husband Joynal Abedin has been sentenced to death, convicted of insurgency. But has the verdict been carried out? If it was, when and where was he executed? If he was indeed hanged, what has happened to his body? Trying to find answers to these questions, Ayesha embarks on a long and arduous quest to search for her husband, reminiscent of Behula’s epic journey in her effort to resurrect her dead husband Lakhinder in the Bengali folktale Manashamangal. Set against the backdrop of a raging famine, political assassinations and coups that took Bangladesh by storm right after its independence in 1971, Anisul Hoque’s The Ballad of Ayesha is as much a story of the newly created nation as it is the story of its people.",The Ballad of Ayesha,Anisul Hoque,Inam Ahmed, ,Harper Perennial,9789352778959,"1st Edition,2018",186,India,English

The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Late Spring and Autumn Period (roughly 5th century BC). The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (""Master Sun"", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to an aspect of warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare[1] and has influenced both Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy and beyond.

This book contained a detailed explanation and analysis of the Chinese military, from weapons and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun Tzu also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Because Sun Tzu has long been considered to be one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training for centuries to come.
Chapter summary
1. Detail assessment and planning: explores the five fundamental factors (the Way, seasons, terrain, leadership, and management) and seven elements that determine the outcomes of military engagements. By thinking, assessing and comparing these points, a commander can calculate his chances of victory. Habitual deviation from these calculations will ensure failure via improper action. The text stresses that war is a very grave matter for the state and must not be commenced without due consideration.
2. Waging war : explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how success requires winning decisive engagements quickly. This section advises that successful military campaigns require limiting the cost of competition and conflict.
3. Strategic attack : defines the source of strength as unity, not size, and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war. In order of importance, these critical factors are: Attack, Strategy, Alliances, Army and Cities.
4. Disposition of the army : explains the importance of defending existing positions until a commander is capable of advancing from those positions in safety. It teaches commanders the importance of recognizing strategic opportunities, and teaches not to create opportunities for the enemy.
5. Forces : explains the use of creativity and timing in building an army's momentum.
6. Weaknesses and strengths : explains how an army's opportunities come from the openings in the environment caused by the relative weakness of the enemy and how to respond to changes in the fluid battlefield over a given area.
7. Military maneuvers : explains the dangers of direct conflict and how to win those confrontations when they are forced upon the commander.
8. Variations and adaptability : focuses on the need for flexibility in an army's responses. It explains how to respond to shifting circumstances successfully.
9. Movement and development of troops : describes the different situations in which an army finds itself as it moves through new enemy territories, and how to respond to these situations. Much of this section focuses on evaluating the intentions of others.
10. Terrain : looks at the three general areas of resistance (distance, dangers and barriers) and the six types of ground positions that arise from them. Each of these six field positions offers certain advantages and disadvantages.
11. The nine battlegrounds : describes the nine common situations (or stages) in a campaign, from scattering to deadly, and the specific focus that a commander will need in order to successfully navigate them.
12. Attacking with fire : explains the general use of weapons and the specific use of the environment as a weapon. This section examines the five targets for attack, the five types of environmental attack and the appropriate responses to such attacks.
13. Intelligence and espionage : focuses on the importance of developing good information sources, and specifies the five types of intelligence sources and how to best manage each of them.",The Art of War : The New Translation,Sun Tzu, , ,Harper Perennial,9780061351419,"Reprint editio,2008",304,India,English

Now, a quarter century after The Joke was first published and several years after the collapse of the Soviet-imposed Czechoslovak regime, it becomes easier to put such implications into perspective in favor of valuing the book (and all Kundera 's work) as what it truly is: great, stirring literature that sheds new light on the eternal themes of human existence.

The present edition provides English-language readers an important further means toward revaluation of The Joke. For reasons he describes in his Author's Note, Milan Kundera devoted much time to creating (with the assistance of his American publisher-editor) a completely revised translation that reflects his original as closely as any translation possibly can: reflects it in its fidelity not only to the words and syntax but also to the characteristic dictions and tonalities of the novel's narrators. The result is nothing less than the restoration of a classic.",The Joke,Milan Kundera, , ,Harper Perennial,9780060995058,"Reprint edition,1994",336,India,English

A collection of stories from across India from writers such as Rabindranath Tagore,  Prabhat Kumar Mukhopadhyay, Rajshekhar Basu and Premchand, 14 shows readers how Satyajit Ray was influenced by these stories. The collection includes stories of magic and wonder, involving a rich land-owner who believes his daughter is Kali incarnate, a clerk who stumbles onto a philosopher's stone, a housewife who is overwhelmed by how large the city is and a sage who proclaims he knew Jesus, Plato and the Buddha. These are movies Satyajit Ray transformed into films, printing his name on the silver screen forever.",14: Stories That Inspired Satyajit Ray,Bhaskar Chattopadhyay, , ,Harper Perennial,9789351361930,"1st Edition,2014",304,India,English

A military coup is thwarted, but the exact sequence of events is shrouded in mystery. Soon after, Ayesha Begum, recovering from the birth of her second child, receives a letter from the air force stating that her husband Joynal Abedin has been sentenced to death, convicted of insurgency. But has the verdict been carried out? If it was, when and where was he executed? If he was indeed hanged, what has happened to his body? Trying to find answers to these questions, Ayesha embarks on a long and arduous quest to search for her husband, reminiscent of Behula’s epic journey in her effort to resurrect her dead husband Lakhinder in the Bengali folktale Manashamangal. Set against the backdrop of a raging famine, political assassinations and coups that took Bangladesh by storm right after its independence in 1971, Anisul Hoque’s The Ballad of Ayesha is as much a story of the newly created nation as it is the story of its people.",The Ballad of Ayesha,Anisul Hoque,Inam Ahmed, ,Harper Perennial,9789352778959,"1st Edition,2018",186,India,English

The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Late Spring and Autumn Period (roughly 5th century BC). The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (""Master Sun"", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to an aspect of warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare[1] and has influenced both Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy and beyond.

This book contained a detailed explanation and analysis of the Chinese military, from weapons and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun Tzu also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Because Sun Tzu has long been considered to be one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training for centuries to come.
Chapter summary
1. Detail assessment and planning: explores the five fundamental factors (the Way, seasons, terrain, leadership, and management) and seven elements that determine the outcomes of military engagements. By thinking, assessing and comparing these points, a commander can calculate his chances of victory. Habitual deviation from these calculations will ensure failure via improper action. The text stresses that war is a very grave matter for the state and must not be commenced without due consideration.
2. Waging war : explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how success requires winning decisive engagements quickly. This section advises that successful military campaigns require limiting the cost of competition and conflict.
3. Strategic attack : defines the source of strength as unity, not size, and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war. In order of importance, these critical factors are: Attack, Strategy, Alliances, Army and Cities.
4. Disposition of the army : explains the importance of defending existing positions until a commander is capable of advancing from those positions in safety. It teaches commanders the importance of recognizing strategic opportunities, and teaches not to create opportunities for the enemy.
5. Forces : explains the use of creativity and timing in building an army's momentum.
6. Weaknesses and strengths : explains how an army's opportunities come from the openings in the environment caused by the relative weakness of the enemy and how to respond to changes in the fluid battlefield over a given area.
7. Military maneuvers : explains the dangers of direct conflict and how to win those confrontations when they are forced upon the commander.
8. Variations and adaptability : focuses on the need for flexibility in an army's responses. It explains how to respond to shifting circumstances successfully.
9. Movement and development of troops : describes the different situations in which an army finds itself as it moves through new enemy territories, and how to respond to these situations. Much of this section focuses on evaluating the intentions of others.
10. Terrain : looks at the three general areas of resistance (distance, dangers and barriers) and the six types of ground positions that arise from them. Each of these six field positions offers certain advantages and disadvantages.
11. The nine battlegrounds : describes the nine common situations (or stages) in a campaign, from scattering to deadly, and the specific focus that a commander will need in order to successfully navigate them.
12. Attacking with fire : explains the general use of weapons and the specific use of the environment as a weapon. This section examines the five targets for attack, the five types of environmental attack and the appropriate responses to such attacks.
13. Intelligence and espionage : focuses on the importance of developing good information sources, and specifies the five types of intelligence sources and how to best manage each of them.",The Art of War : The New Translation,Sun Tzu, , ,Harper Perennial,9780061351419,"Reprint editio,2008",304,India,English

Now, a quarter century after The Joke was first published and several years after the collapse of the Soviet-imposed Czechoslovak regime, it becomes easier to put such implications into perspective in favor of valuing the book (and all Kundera 's work) as what it truly is: great, stirring literature that sheds new light on the eternal themes of human existence.

The present edition provides English-language readers an important further means toward revaluation of The Joke. For reasons he describes in his Author's Note, Milan Kundera devoted much time to creating (with the assistance of his American publisher-editor) a completely revised translation that reflects his original as closely as any translation possibly can: reflects it in its fidelity not only to the words and syntax but also to the characteristic dictions and tonalities of the novel's narrators. The result is nothing less than the restoration of a classic.",The Joke,Milan Kundera, , ,Harper Perennial,9780060995058,"Reprint edition,1994",336,India,English

A collection of stories from across India from writers such as Rabindranath Tagore,  Prabhat Kumar Mukhopadhyay, Rajshekhar Basu and Premchand, 14 shows readers how Satyajit Ray was influenced by these stories. The collection includes stories of magic and wonder, involving a rich land-owner who believes his daughter is Kali incarnate, a clerk who stumbles onto a philosopher's stone, a housewife who is overwhelmed by how large the city is and a sage who proclaims he knew Jesus, Plato and the Buddha. These are movies Satyajit Ray transformed into films, printing his name on the silver screen forever.",14: Stories That Inspired Satyajit Ray,Bhaskar Chattopadhyay, , ,Harper Perennial,9789351361930,"1st Edition,2014",304,India,English
