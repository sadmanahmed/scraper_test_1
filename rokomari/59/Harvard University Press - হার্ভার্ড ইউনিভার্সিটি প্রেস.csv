The book emphasises that it is essential for every person to be their own manager and promote their own interests, to survive and thrive in this world. This requires one to be acutely aware of one’s strengths and weaknesses, the values one stands by, and the guiding principles of their life. This will make it easier for a person to find the right work environment to operate from, as well as change the course of action if the need arises, to find something more suitable. It stresses on the need to take advantage of one’s strengths in order to contribute to one’s organisation or workplace and make the fifty odd working years of one’s life the most productive and successful years. The book advises readers on how they can make the most of every opportunity and create a niche for themselves in their organisation.",Managing Oneself,Peter F.

Looking at cases involving product liability, medical malpractice, toxic torts, genetic engineering, and life and death, Jasanoff argues that the courts do not simply depend on scientific findings for guidance; rather, they actually influence the production of science and technology at many different levels. With its lucid analysis of both scientific and legal modes of reasoning, and its recommendations for scholars and policymakers, this book will be an indispensable resource for anyone who hopes to understand the changing configurations of science, technology, and the law in our litigious society.","Science at the Bar: Law,Science,and Technology in America",Sheila Jasanoff, , ,Harvard University Press,9780674793033,Latest, ,USA,English
