The book begins with a history of the discovery of the anatomy and physiology of the ear and works systematically from the external, middle, and inner ear to the brain and clinical manifestations of pathology. It covers topics such as sound and bone conduction mechanisms, signal processing, stimulus coding in the auditory system, blood circulation of the cochlea, and auditory brain mapping. To further underst current and future developments in the field, the book explains some of the research techniques now being used such as patch clamp recording from hair cells. The book is practical for otolaryngologists in that it covers important aspects of non-auditory physiology such as skin migration in the ear canal and facial nerve physiology. Chapters are updated and re-written to reflect modern advances, plus new chapters, including cortical aspects of hearing, offer more information to complete the scope of material regarding physiology of the ear. Charts, graphs, photographs, and illustrations clarify key points and concepts.",Physiology of the Ear,Anthony F. Jahn, , ,Singular Pub,9781565939943,"2nd Edition,2001",704,India,English
