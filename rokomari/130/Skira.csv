This is the defining volume in the Bengal Foundation series of monographs dedicated to the great master artists of Bangladesh. Beautifully illustrated, with stunning fold outs, this book is the only comprehensive survey of Zainul Abedin’s work to date, illustrating his special relationship with his country from various artistic, social, and political perspectives.
For his devotion to art education and his visionary and artistic achievements, Zainul Abedin has always been the undisputed protagonist of the Bangladeshi modern art scene. In 1943, he produced a series of renowned sketches depicting the Bengal Famine, in which millions of people perished. Abedin’s haunting images brought him all-India fame. His indigenous brand of realism, coupled with his social inquiry and protest proved vital in different moments in Bangladesh’s history, such as the Liberation War in 1971. Abedin did more than just make art; he wanted art to permeate all our lives. This exceptional retrospective monograph is a fitting tribute to his lifelong mission and a unique insight into Bangladeshi art and culture.",Muhammod Jainul Abedin : Great Masters Of Bangladesh, , ,Bengal-Skira Collection,Skira, , , ,Bangladesh,English

Kazi Ghiyasuddin (Madaripur, Bangladesh, 1951) has been living between Bangladesh and Japan since 1975. On this rare creative journey, he draws his inspiration from nature to project his desire for harmony and peace. Producing richly textured canvases, his unique style resonates with delicate, inwardly expanding applications of paint. His early, more formal works have evolved into suggestive dream-like contemplations. As if conducting a sensory orchestra, Ghiyasuddin has melded two distinct cultures and aesthetics.
This book showcases over 200 color plates tracing the artist’s personal vision over three decades of change in Bangladesh, and will appeal to all those interested in contemporary art in South Asia; particularly collectors, curators, academics, and artists.",Kazi Ghiyasuddin : Contemporary Masters of Bangladesh, , ,Bengal-Skira Collection,Skira, ,"1st,2011", ,Bangladesh,English

Rafiq Azam is a world-renowned architect. He recently received the Residential Building of the Year Award at the 2012 Emirates Glass LEAF Awards, which took place during the 2012 London Design Festival. He has a holistic approach to design, which not only incorporates the elements of nature but also harnesses its beauty and potential in a practical way in order to enhance the personal experience of a building. From his uniquely Bangladeshi perspective, the human form has two parts—the body as shell and thoughts as soul—and his architecture is similar, where the building manifests as the shell and nature as its soul. Considering the socioeconomic and city-planning conditions of Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital, Azam’s architectural vocabulary is kept simple and essential, with traditional spaces like the courtyard, pond, and ghat (steps leading into water) and ample internal and external greenery that merge both urban and rural typologies in an intensely urban context. He arranges water courts as swimming ponds in the middle of homes, natural light rooms, and unfolding wall systems to emphasize the interrelationship between form and space. With more than 200 color and black-and-white plates, exquisite design sketches, and aerial views, as well as watercolor paintings and inspirational phrases, this exceptionally beautiful book is a unique introduction and insight into a visionary architect and Bangladeshi contemporary living and culture.",Rafiq Azam  :Architecture for Green Living, , ,Bengal-Skira Collection,Skira, , , ,Bangladesh,English
