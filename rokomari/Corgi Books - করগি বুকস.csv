It follows ""symbologist"" Robert Langdon and cryptologist Sophie Neveu after a murder in the Louvre Museum in Paris causes them to become involved in a battle between the Priory of Sion and Opus Dei over the possibility of Jesus Christ having been a companion to Mary Magdalene.

The title of the novel refers to the finding of the first murder victim in the Grand Gallery of the Louvre, naked and posed similar to Leonardo da Vinci's famous drawing, the Vitruvian Man, with a mathematical message written beside his body and a pentagram drawn on his chest in his own blood.

The novel explores an alternative religious history, whose central plot point is that the Merovingian kings of France were descended from the bloodline of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene, ideas derived from Clive Prince's The Templar Revelation (1997) and books by Margaret Starbird. The book also refers to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (1982) though Dan Brown has stated that it was not used as research material.

The Da Vinci Code provoked a popular interest in speculation concerning the Holy Grail legend and Mary Magdalene's role in the history of Christianity. The book has, however, been extensively denounced by many Christian denominations as an attack on the Roman Catholic Church, and consistently criticized for its historical and scientific inaccuracies.

The novel nonetheless became a worldwide bestseller[1] that sold 80 million copies as of 2009[2] and has been translated into 44 languages.",The Da Vinci Code,Dan Brown, , ,Corgi Books,9780552161275,"Reissue Edition,2009",590,USA,English

FACT
The world's largest scientific research facility - Switzerland's Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN) - recently succeeded in producing the first particles of antimatter. Antimatter is identical to physical matter except that it is composed of particles whose electric charges are opposite to those found in normal matter. 
Antimatter is the most powerful energy source known to man. It releases energy with 100 per cent efficiency (nuclear fission is 1.5 per cent efficient). Antimatter creates no pollution or radiation, and a droplet could power New York City for a full day. 
There is, however, one catch... 
Antimatter is highly unstable. It ignites when it comes in contact with absolutely anything... even air. A single gram of antimatter contains the energy of a 20-kiloton nuclear bomb - the size of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. 
Until recently antimatter has been created only in very small amounts (a few atoms at a time). But CERN has now broken ground on its new Antiproton Decelerator - an advanced antimatter production facility that promises to create antimatter in much larger quantities.

When a new NASA satellite spots evidence of an astonishingly rare object buried deep in the Arctic ice, the floundering space agency proclaims a much-needed victory...a victory that has profound implications for U.S. space policy and the impending presidential election. With the Oval Office in the balance, the President dispatches White House Intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton to the Milne Ice Shelf to verify the authenticity of the find. Accompanied by a team of experts, including the charismatic academic Michael Tolland, Rachel uncovers the unthinkable: evidence of scientific trickery -- a bold deception that threatens to plunge the world into controversy. 

But before Rachel can contact the President, she and Michael are attacked by a deadly team of assassins controlled by a mysterious power broker who will stop at nothing to hide the truth. Fleeing for their lives in an environment as desolate as it is lethal, their only hope for survival is to find out who is behind this masterful ploy. The truth, they will learn, is the most shocking deception of all. 

In his most thrilling novel to date, bestselling author Dan Brown transports readers from the ultrasecret National Reconnaissance Office to the towering ice shelves of the Arctic Circle, and back again to the hallways of power inside the West Wing. Heralded for masterfully intermingling science, history, and politics in his critically acclaimed thriller Angels and Demons, Brown has crafted another novel in which nothing is as it seems -- and behind every corner is a stunning surprise.

When the United States National Security Agency's code-breaking supercomputer TRANSLTR encounters a revolutionary new code, Digital Fortress, that it cannot break, Commander Trevor Strathmore calls in head cryptographer Susan Fletcher to crack it. She discovers that it was written by Ensei Tankado, a former NSA employee who became displeased with the NSA's intrusion into people's private lives. If the NSA doesn't reveal TRANSLTR to the public, Tankado intends to auction the code's algorithm on his website and have his partner, ""North Dakota"", release it for free if he dies, essentially holding the NSA hostage. The agency is determined to stop Digital Fortress from becoming a threat to national security.

When Tankado does indeed die in Seville, of what appears to be a heart attack, Strathmore asks Susan's fiancé David Becker to travel to Seville and recover a ring that Tankado was wearing when he died. The ring is suspected to have the code that unlocks Digital Fortress. However, Becker soon discovers that Tankado gave the ring away just before his death. Each person he questions in the search for the ring is murdered by Hulohot, a mysterious deaf assassin.

Meanwhile, telephone calls between North Dakota and Tokugen Numataka (chairman of the Japanese computer company Numatech) reveal that North Dakota hired Hulohot to kill Tankado in order to gain access to the passcode on his ring and speed up the release of the algorithm. At the NSA, Fletcher's investigation leads her to believe that Greg Hale, a fellow NSA employee, is North Dakota. Phil Chartrukian, an NSA technician who is unaware of the Digital Fortress code breaking failure and believes Digital Fortress to be a virus, conducts his own investigation into whether Strathmore allowed Digital Fortress to bypass Gauntlet (NSA's virus/worm filter). However, Chartrukian is murdered after being pushed off the catwalk in the sub-levels of TRANSLTR by an unknown assailant. Since Hale and Strathmore were both in the sub-levels, Fletcher assumes that Hale is the killer; however, Hale claims that he witnessed Strathmore killing Chartrukian. Chartrukian's fall also damages TRANSLTR's cooling system.

Hale holds Fletcher and Strathmore hostage to prevent himself from being arrested for the murder. It is then that Hale explains that the e-mail he supposedly received from Tankado was actually in his inbox because he was snooping on Strathmore, who was also watching Tankado's e-mail account. After the encounter, Hale's name is cleared when Fletcher discovers through a tracer that North Dakota and Ensei Tankado are actually the same person, as ""NDAKOTA"" is an anagram of ""Tankado."" Strathmore exposes himself when he fatally shoots Hale and arranges it to appear as a suicide. Susan later discovers through Strathmore's pager that he is the one who hired Hulohot. Becker later kills Hulohot in a violent confrontation.

Chapters told from Strathmore's perspective reveal his motives. By hiring Hulohot to kill Tankado, having Becker recover his ring and at the same time arranging for Hulohot to kill him, he would facilitate a romantic relationship with Fletcher, regaining his lost honor and enable him to unlock Digital Fortress. By making phone calls to Numataka posing as North Dakota, he thought he could partner with Numatech to make a Digital Fortress chip equipped with his own backdoor Trojan so that the NSA could spy on every computer equipped with these chips. However, Strathmore was unaware that Digital Fortress is actually a computer worm that, once unlocked would ""eat away"" at the NSA databank's security and allow ""any third-grader with a modem"" to look at government secrets. When TRANSLTR overheats, Strathmore commits suicide by standing next to the machine as it explodes. The worm eventually gets into the database, but soon after David Becker figures out the password (3, the difference between the Hiroshima nuclear bomb, Isotope 235, and the Nagasaki nuclear bomb, isotope 238, a reference to the nuclear bombs that killed Tankado's mother and left him crippled), and is able to terminate the worm before hackers can get any significant data. The NSA allows Becker to return to the United States, reuniting him with Fletcher. In the epilogue, it is revealed that Numataka is Ensei Tankado's father. Numataka left Tankado the day he was born since Tankado was a deformed child.",Digital Fortress,Dan Brown, , ,Corgi Books,9780552161251,"Reissue edition,2009",510,India,English

The novel begins when Robert Langdon is summoned to a Smithsonian fundraiser in Washington DC by his mentor, Peter Solomon, who he is told will be speaking at the event. Robert is told by Peter to bring a small sealed box that he entrusted to Robert years before. Robert arrives at the fundraiser but Peter is not in attendance – after calling Peter’s assistant, Robert discovers that the call was a hoax to lure him to the museum by Peter’s kidnapper, Mal’akh. Moments later, Robert hears a scream, and discovers Peter’s severed hand in the Capitol Rotunda. The hand has a Freemason’s ring on one finger, and is tattooed with mysterious symbols on the fingers and the palm.

Robert then meets officers Anderson and Sato, who enlist him to help them interpret the symbols on Peter’s hand. The three soon find themselves at a Masonic altar in the Capitol’s basement, where they find an inscribed pyramid without its capstone. Anderson and Sato attempt to take Robert into custody because x-ray records that show that he was carrying a pyramid shaped object into the Capitol earlier that evening – this pyramid was in the sealed package that Peter requested Robert bring. But before he can be arrested, the Capitol’s architect William Bellamy is added into the mix, and in the confusion William and Robert flee together. Later, William tells Robert that he wants his assistance rescuing Peter.

At this point, Brown reveals that Mal’akh is a heavily tattooed Freemason, and many chapters are dedicated to telling the backstory between Peter Solomon and Mal’akh. Mal’akh, formerly known as Andros Dareios, was the cellmate of Peter’s rebellious son Zachary during his brief imprisonment in Turkey, where Zachary was caught smuggling drugs. Zachary was murdered in prison, and Dareios steals Zachary’s large inheritance and flees to Greece. Andros becomes obsessed with the Freemasons from stories Zachary told him in prison, and breaks into Peter’s house to find the pyramid hidden there. During the break-in, Andros accidentally kills Peter’s mother, and is then shot by Peter and left to die. He nurses himself back to health, takes the name Mal’akh, and makes it his mission to uncover the secrets of the Freemasons.

For many chapters there is confusion around the identity of Mal’akh, and William accuses Agent Sato of working with Mal’akh, though she is not. The group is joined by Katherine Solomon, Peter’s sister, who runs a noetic science lab at the Smithsonian. Mal’akh destroys her lab and nearly captures her, but she escapes and continues with Robert, William, and Sato in the search to find Peter.

Eventually, the group is captured by Mal’akh, and Robert is nearly drowned in a sensory deprivation tank that Mal’akh uses as a tool to interrogate him about the encoded inscription on the bottom of the pyramid capstone. Mal’akh also nearly kills Katherine with a hypodermic needle, and Peter Solomon is discovered alive but weak and bound to a wheelchair. Mal’akh flees with Peter to the Temple Room of the Scottish Rites House of the Temple, and in a shocking reveal the group discovers, at the moment just before Peter kills Mal’akh, that Mal’akh is in fact Zachary. Rather than being murdered in prison, Zachary had killed another man and disfigured him beyond recognition, and then assumed another identity to escape. Peter tries to kill Zachary, but can’t bring himself to do it. In that moment, Sato arrives by helicopter to the Temple and breaks the glass ceiling – the shards of glass fall, and one fatally impales Zachary.

At the end of the novel, Peter shows Robert the true secrets of the Freemasons – a Bible, which the Masons believe holds the key to the enlightenment of the human spirit. It is also revealed that Katherine’s research has been backed up externally, and as such she can continue her research.",The Lost Symbol,Dan Brown, , ,Corgi Books,9780552161237,"Published,2010",672,India,English
