It deals with five topics on Advanced or Higher Surveying. The book has been primarily written as a college textbook to fill a need for simple but complete coverage of the principles of Field Astronomy, Photogtrammetry, Electro-Magnetic Distance Measurement (EDM), Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System(GIS). The book is also meant ot, assist the experienced surveyor who has not found time to follow the rapid changes in the techniques so noticeable in the surveying field. The subject is gradually introduced in stages. Large number of solved and unsolved examples develop reader's ability to apply the basic concepts to practical problems. The book also deals with the most modern equipments used in Photogrammetric Surveying and Electro-Magnetic Distance Measurement, including Total Station.",Higher Surveying,"B. C.

Soil mechanics is an important branch of engineering mechanics applied in civil engineering to predict the behavior of soil. All structures have the same foundation, i.e. earth. Thus, a study of the behavior of its chief component becomes prudent for every civil engineer.

Soil Mechanics And Foundations is a must-have for every civil engineering student. It deals with topics beyond soil characteristics, including retaining wall, foundations, and piers. It also discusses stresses due to surface loads, the effect of water on stress conditions, seepage, shear strength, and soil permeability. Theories are explained with in-depth examples and a list of experiments to assist in the learning process.

The book includes topics like soil structure and clay mineralogy, earth pressure, shallow foundations, and design of flexible pavement. The book is divided into 34 chapters and eight parts for easier navigation between topics.

An updated, accurate, and comprehensive book on soil mechanics is necessary as the safety of structures depends greatly on their foundations. The book helps in presenting the reader with design principles and theories on foundation engineering and soil mechanics. The book can be useful for students pursuing postgraduate and undergraduate courses in soil engineering. Soil Mechanics And Foundations also includes 21 lab experiments.
