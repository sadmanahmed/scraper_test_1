Ladybird supports children’s learning at home by providing clear preparation and thorough practice for work done in school. Helping young children prepare for starting nursery and then school, Ladybird lays the foundations for vital practical, emotional and educational skills. Activities are carefully graded and small steps reinforced to encourage a firm understanding of concept. The key curriculum areas of literacy and numeracy are thoroughly and enjoyably practiced. Early science is also introduced in an engaging and relevant way.


The activities in Series 1 present the language associated with concepts such as simple arithmetic and telling the time in an imaginative and entertaining way. The pictures of familiar objects and musing animal drawings are stimulating and easy for children to recognize. Series 2 contains activities to consolidate the knowledge and skills acquired in Series 1.
