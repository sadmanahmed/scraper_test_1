Man made fertilizers have come to stay in the 20th Century for increasing demand of human population which has been further accentuated by the limited availability of additional fertile farm land. The pathway of productivity improvement followed so far has, however, been accompanied by an exponential increase in the consumption of non-renewable forms of energy.

The forest of the coutry are under intense biotic pressure leading to degradation of forest resources. The supply of industrial and domestic wood from forest areas has been dwinding. The average annual increment of forests in India is very low (0.7m/ha/year compared to the world average of 2.1.m/ha/year) to meet the much needed demands of fuel wood, tiber, and aw material for industries in large quantities. We must therefore have to pay more attention to production forestry, which involves raising plantations of fast growing species under short rotation intensive culture management.
