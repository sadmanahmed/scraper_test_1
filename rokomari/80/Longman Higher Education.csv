It gives the fundamentals of engineering thermodynamics and their application to particular fluids and the ways in which work and heat transfer are affected. Part I is devoted to the principles of thermodynamics, Part II to applications of the principles to particular fluids, and Parts III and IV respectively to ways in which work and heat transfers are effected. This scheme leaves it open to the lecturer to choose any preferred order of presentation, but also provides the student with a book which enables principle to be distinguished from application.",Engineering Thermodynamics: Work and Heat Transfer,"G.F.C.
