Ten new chapters have been added to make up for earlier deficiencies. The last three chapters cover many congenital defects many difficult and rare topics and syndromes with notes. The book is designed to serve as a handy text-reference on clinical examination of ophthalmic cases covering the ocular disease that postgraduate students come to see examine and treat during their clinical postings. The book presents clinical examination of the ophthalmic cases in poetic format that would be suitable to postgraduate students during their study and later when they enter the profession independently. The reader-friendly format of the book will help postgraduate students understand imbibe retain and reproduce the facts easily anytime and anywhere especially in the practical examinations while presenting their cases to the examiners who are keen to critically analyze the presentations threadbare. The book should be in the hands of not only the postgraduate students but also residents faculty members and practicing ophthalmologists.

The book is a concise form and will help the readers to a great extent. Organic chemistry students are often overwhelmed by the number of compounds and reactions. And they wonder whether they can learn all this material in a single year. But most of the-Organic Chemistry consists of a few basic principles and a large number of extensions and applications of those principles. Relatively little memorization is required if the students grasp each major concept and develops flexibility in applying that concept. How much a student learns depends on himself. The arrangement of the subject matter is based on medicinal properties. IUPAC nomenclature of drugs is stressed throughout the book and a separate chapter on common nomenclature is included to develop the students familiarity. Following the nomenclature. Brand names chemical structure properties uses adverse effects and official preparations of each drug are discussed. Synthetic procedures of Important-drugs are- mentioned. Storage conditions of each compound are described and a chapter concerning stability is presented.

A manual is incorporated however thus freeing the student from additional expenditure and as it is based upon the preceding theoretical discussion it should be more meaningful than the cook-book type of manual. The subject of soil analysis is relatively young and procedures are constantly being modified improved or superseded. The only way of competently performing many analyses has been by reference to articles in scientific journals which are not always readily available and not all analysts are up to date in their reading. There is often controversy over the relative merits of different analytical procedures and it is even not unknown for one soil laboratory to use method B because another is using method A. At every soils conference there is a plea and even a decision to standardize methods but this like many conference decisions has failed to materialize. It must be remembered of course that different soils sometimes need different methods for the same analysis.,A Textbook of Soil Chemical Analysis,P.R.Hesse, , ,CBS,9788123918334,"1st Edition,2002",520,India,English

Reproductive disorders are more apparent in females hence failures are often attributed to female gender only. A close examination of the process however reveals that males are as great offenders as females to cause infertility problems. The male should provide sperms which are competent to fertilize the ovum. Whenever there is large-scale problem of infertility in a herd or in large number of females the male is always seen with suspicion. In addition to productive efficiency the clinical examination of the bull for its reproductive efficiency is gaining more and more popularity.

A manual is incorporated however thus freeing the student from additional expenditure and as it is based upon the preceding theoretical discussion it should be more meaningful than the cook-book type of manual. The subject of soil analysis is relatively young and procedures are constantly being modified improved or superseded. The only way of competently performing many analyses has been by reference to articles in scientific journals which are not always readily available and not all analysts are up to date in their reading. There is often controversy over the relative merits of different analytical procedures and it is even not unknown for one soil laboratory to use method B because another is using method A. At every soils conference there is a plea and even a decision to standardize methods but this like many conference decisions has failed to materialize. It must be remembered of course that different soils sometimes need different methods for the same analysis.,A Textbook of Soil Chemical Analysis,P.R.Hesse, , ,CBS,9788123918334,"1st Edition,2002",520,India,English

Reproductive disorders are more apparent in females hence failures are often attributed to female gender only. A close examination of the process however reveals that males are as great offenders as females to cause infertility problems. The male should provide sperms which are competent to fertilize the ovum. Whenever there is large-scale problem of infertility in a herd or in large number of females the male is always seen with suspicion. In addition to productive efficiency the clinical examination of the bull for its reproductive efficiency is gaining more and more popularity.

In total, this book comprises 35 chapters. Some chapters include Posterior Abdominal Wall, Urinary Bladder and Urethra, Male Reproductive Organs, Large Blood Vessels of the Gut, and Bones of Lower Limb. Through the course of this book, Garg has included several color-line diagrams, which are relevant to the text. Garg has made use of several illustrations to explain the concepts better to the readers, helping them retain the information to perform well in their examinations.

In the first section, Garg explains the bones present in the lower limb, along with detailed explanation of muscles and joints. At the close of the first section, there is an appendix that contains insights into the lower limb nerves, in a tabular form. The second section covers the different types of hernia and the systems that regulate the functioning inside the body. The second appendix contains a tabulated form of the arteries present in the pelvis and abdomen. B D Chaurasia’s Human Anatomy: Lower Limb, Abdomen And Pelvis - Companion Pocketbook For Quick Review (Volume-2) is directed mostly towards undergraduate students. However, it can also be used as a reference guide during clinical practice.

The three volumes have steadily been enlarging to accommodate gross anatomy, histology, embryology and detailed clinical anatomy. Numerous colour line diagrams support the text of gross, surface and clinical anatomy. Numerous colour line diagrams support the text of gross, surface and clinical anatomy. Because of the size, it  is difficult for the students to revise the volumes prior to their class tests and examinations.

The CAMPANION POCKETBOOKS on the volumes have been designed and brought our giving only the essential components highlighting “must know” of anatomy. Content of each pocketbook is almost one third the size of the main volume, meant mainly for quick last minute revision of the “ volatile anatomy” . The illustrations are aimed at helping the students review  the topics easily as well as retaining and reproducing the information clearly in their examinations. Clinical aspects are included with equal intensity. Mainly meant for professional undergraduate students, they could also use these for quick reference during their clinical postings.
Highlights of  Volume 1

Relatively little memorization is required if the students grasp each major concept and develops flexibility in applying that concept. How much a student learns depends on himself. The arrangement of the subject matter is based on medicinal properties. IUPAC nomenclature of drugs is stressed throughout the book and a separate chapter on common nomenclature is included to develop the students familiarity. Following the nomenclature. Brand names chemical structure properties uses adverse effects and official preparations of each drug are discussed. Synthetic procedures of Important-drugs are- mentioned. Storage conditions of each compound are described and a chapter concerning stability is presented.

A manual is incorporated however thus freeing the student from additional expenditure and as it is based upon the preceding theoretical discussion it should be more meaningful than the cook-book type of manual. The subject of soil analysis is relatively young and procedures are constantly being modified improved or superseded. The only way of competently performing many analyses has been by reference to articles in scientific journals which are not always readily available and not all analysts are up to date in their reading. There is often controversy over the relative merits of different analytical procedures and it is even not unknown for one soil laboratory to use method B because another is using method A. At every soils conference there is a plea and even a decision to standardize methods but this like many conference decisions has failed to materialize. It must be remembered of course that different soils sometimes need different methods for the same analysis.,A Textbook of Soil Chemical Analysis,P.R.Hesse, , ,CBS,9788123918334,"1st Edition,2002",520,India,English

Reproductive disorders are more apparent in females hence failures are often attributed to female gender only. A close examination of the process however reveals that males are as great offenders as females to cause infertility problems. The male should provide sperms which are competent to fertilize the ovum. Whenever there is large-scale problem of infertility in a herd or in large number of females the male is always seen with suspicion. In addition to productive efficiency the clinical examination of the bull for its reproductive efficiency is gaining more and more popularity.

Summary Of The Book

B D Chaurasia’s Human Anatomy: Lower Limb, Abdomen And Pelvis - Companion Pocketbook For Quick Review (Volume-2) is a pocket book that contains a comprehensive overview of the human anatomy. The BD Chaurasia's Human Anatomy series is a trusted name among the student community, as it provides them with simply-written material, with detailed illustrations, which makes learning human anatomy a much more easier and enjoyable experience. Most medical students will often find it difficult to revise important concepts before their examination, as they have to read a vast number of books to do so. In this pocket book, only the essential aspects of anatomy are covered, making it excellent for last-minute revision.

In total, this book comprises 35 chapters. Some chapters include Posterior Abdominal Wall, Urinary Bladder and Urethra, Male Reproductive Organs, Large Blood Vessels of the Gut, and Bones of Lower Limb. Through the course of this book, Garg has included several color-line diagrams, which are relevant to the text. Garg has made use of several illustrations to explain the concepts better to the readers, helping them retain the information to perform well in their examinations.

In the first section, Garg explains the bones present in the lower limb, along with detailed explanation of muscles and joints. At the close of the first section, there is an appendix that contains insights into the lower limb nerves, in a tabular form. The second section covers the different types of hernia and the systems that regulate the functioning inside the body. The second appendix contains a tabulated form of the arteries present in the pelvis and abdomen. B D Chaurasia’s Human Anatomy: Lower Limb, Abdomen And Pelvis - Companion Pocketbook For Quick Review (Volume-2) is directed mostly towards undergraduate students. However, it can also be used as a reference guide during clinical practice.

The book is a concise form and will help the readers to a great extent. Organic chemistry students are often overwhelmed by the number of compounds and reactions. And they wonder whether they can learn all this material in a single year. But most of the-Organic Chemistry consists of a few basic principles and a large number of extensions and applications of those principles. Relatively little memorization is required if the students grasp each major concept and develops flexibility in applying that concept. How much a student learns depends on himself. The arrangement of the subject matter is based on medicinal properties. IUPAC nomenclature of drugs is stressed throughout the book and a separate chapter on common nomenclature is included to develop the students familiarity. Following the nomenclature. Brand names chemical structure properties uses adverse effects and official preparations of each drug are discussed. Synthetic procedures of Important-drugs are- mentioned. Storage conditions of each compound are described and a chapter concerning stability is presented.

A manual is incorporated however thus freeing the student from additional expenditure and as it is based upon the preceding theoretical discussion it should be more meaningful than the cook-book type of manual. The subject of soil analysis is relatively young and procedures are constantly being modified improved or superseded. The only way of competently performing many analyses has been by reference to articles in scientific journals which are not always readily available and not all analysts are up to date in their reading. There is often controversy over the relative merits of different analytical procedures and it is even not unknown for one soil laboratory to use method B because another is using method A. At every soils conference there is a plea and even a decision to standardize methods but this like many conference decisions has failed to materialize. It must be remembered of course that different soils sometimes need different methods for the same analysis.,A Textbook of Soil Chemical Analysis,P.R.Hesse, , ,CBS,9788123918334,"1st Edition,2002",520,India,English

Reproductive disorders are more apparent in females hence failures are often attributed to female gender only. A close examination of the process however reveals that males are as great offenders as females to cause infertility problems. The male should provide sperms which are competent to fertilize the ovum. Whenever there is large-scale problem of infertility in a herd or in large number of females the male is always seen with suspicion. In addition to productive efficiency the clinical examination of the bull for its reproductive efficiency is gaining more and more popularity.

In this pocket book, only the essential aspects of anatomy are covered, making it excellent for last-minute revision.

In total, this book comprises 35 chapters. Some chapters include Posterior Abdominal Wall, Urinary Bladder and Urethra, Male Reproductive Organs, Large Blood Vessels of the Gut, and Bones of Lower Limb. Through the course of this book, Garg has included several color-line diagrams, which are relevant to the text. Garg has made use of several illustrations to explain the concepts better to the readers, helping them retain the information to perform well in their examinations.

In the first section, Garg explains the bones present in the lower limb, along with detailed explanation of muscles and joints. At the close of the first section, there is an appendix that contains insights into the lower limb nerves, in a tabular form. The second section covers the different types of hernia and the systems that regulate the functioning inside the body. The second appendix contains a tabulated form of the arteries present in the pelvis and abdomen. B D Chaurasia’s Human Anatomy: Lower Limb, Abdomen And Pelvis - Companion Pocketbook For Quick Review (Volume-2) is directed mostly towards undergraduate students.

Poultry provides protective food in human nutrition in the form of egg and meat and employment opportunities at various level. Poultry fanning has become increasingly populate both in rural and urban areas. It has made tremendous tried and has to an extent taken the shape of an industry. Poultry fanning has become very encouraging enterprise in modern India for small farmers landless laborers and educated unemployed as well as for big entrepreneurs keeping birds on industrial pattern. Person engaged in poultry production needs sufficient knowledge of poultry rearing. Keeping this fact in mind Poultry Production is published to help the under graduate and post graduate students of different agricultural and veterinary colleges and also for the extension workers poultry farmers and those who are going to adopt the poultry.

The book is a concise form and will help the readers to a great extent. Organic chemistry students are often overwhelmed by the number of compounds and reactions. And they wonder whether they can learn all this material in a single year. But most of the-Organic Chemistry consists of a few basic principles and a large number of extensions and applications of those principles. Relatively little memorization is required if the students grasp each major concept and develops flexibility in applying that concept. How much a student learns depends on himself. The arrangement of the subject matter is based on medicinal properties. IUPAC nomenclature of drugs is stressed throughout the book and a separate chapter on common nomenclature is included to develop the students familiarity. Following the nomenclature. Brand names chemical structure properties uses adverse effects and official preparations of each drug are discussed. Synthetic procedures of Important-drugs are- mentioned. Storage conditions of each compound are described and a chapter concerning stability is presented.

A manual is incorporated however thus freeing the student from additional expenditure and as it is based upon the preceding theoretical discussion it should be more meaningful than the cook-book type of manual. The subject of soil analysis is relatively young and procedures are constantly being modified improved or superseded. The only way of competently performing many analyses has been by reference to articles in scientific journals which are not always readily available and not all analysts are up to date in their reading. There is often controversy over the relative merits of different analytical procedures and it is even not unknown for one soil laboratory to use method B because another is using method A. At every soils conference there is a plea and even a decision to standardize methods but this like many conference decisions has failed to materialize. It must be remembered of course that different soils sometimes need different methods for the same analysis.,A Textbook of Soil Chemical Analysis,P.R.Hesse, , ,CBS,9788123918334,"1st Edition,2002",520,India,English

Reproductive disorders are more apparent in females hence failures are often attributed to female gender only. A close examination of the process however reveals that males are as great offenders as females to cause infertility problems. The male should provide sperms which are competent to fertilize the ovum. Whenever there is large-scale problem of infertility in a herd or in large number of females the male is always seen with suspicion. In addition to productive efficiency the clinical examination of the bull for its reproductive efficiency is gaining more and more popularity.

The book is a concise form and will help the readers to a great extent. Organic chemistry students are often overwhelmed by the number of compounds and reactions. And they wonder whether they can learn all this material in a single year. But most of the-Organic Chemistry consists of a few basic principles and a large number of extensions and applications of those principles. Relatively little memorization is required if the students grasp each major concept and develops flexibility in applying that concept. How much a student learns depends on himself. The arrangement of the subject matter is based on medicinal properties. IUPAC nomenclature of drugs is stressed throughout the book and a separate chapter on common nomenclature is included to develop the students familiarity. Following the nomenclature. Brand names chemical structure properties uses adverse effects and official preparations of each drug are discussed. Synthetic procedures of Important-drugs are- mentioned. Storage conditions of each compound are described and a chapter concerning stability is presented.

A manual is incorporated however thus freeing the student from additional expenditure and as it is based upon the preceding theoretical discussion it should be more meaningful than the cook-book type of manual. The subject of soil analysis is relatively young and procedures are constantly being modified improved or superseded. The only way of competently performing many analyses has been by reference to articles in scientific journals which are not always readily available and not all analysts are up to date in their reading. There is often controversy over the relative merits of different analytical procedures and it is even not unknown for one soil laboratory to use method B because another is using method A. At every soils conference there is a plea and even a decision to standardize methods but this like many conference decisions has failed to materialize. It must be remembered of course that different soils sometimes need different methods for the same analysis.,A Textbook of Soil Chemical Analysis,P.R.Hesse, , ,CBS,9788123918334,"1st Edition,2002",520,India,English

Reproductive disorders are more apparent in females hence failures are often attributed to female gender only. A close examination of the process however reveals that males are as great offenders as females to cause infertility problems. The male should provide sperms which are competent to fertilize the ovum. Whenever there is large-scale problem of infertility in a herd or in large number of females the male is always seen with suspicion. In addition to productive efficiency the clinical examination of the bull for its reproductive efficiency is gaining more and more popularity.
