Meghnad Desai writes about the Bhagavad Gita saying that it is a secular text. He believes that it is a creation of humans done over centuries. He also puts across that the Gita, at some level, reinforces inequality among people and is toxic in many ways. It also says that it shows people not to care about others and that it justifies violence to a large extent.
