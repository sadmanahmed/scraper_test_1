We cannot change the Cards We are deal just how we play the hand 
-Randy Pausch

A lot of professors give talks called the Last Lecture reflecting on what matters most to them and what they'd like to pass on. In September 2007 computer science professor Randy Pausch delevered a last lecture called  ""Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams"". Ironically, it really was his last lecture, as this youthful, energetic and cheerful man had just been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and had only months to live.
Randy’s lecture about the joy of life - his legacy to his three young children - has become a phenomenon, as has this book written on the same principles, celebrating the dreams we all try to make a reality.
The Last Lecture is an inspirational and heart-warming book about living, not dying. It should change your life.

Because time is all you have... and you may find one day that you have less time than you think.

					Introduction
I HAVE AN engineering problem. While for the most part I'm in terrific physical shape, I have ten tumors in my liver and I have only a few months left to live. I am a father of three young children, and married to the woman of my dreams. While I could easily feel sorry for myself, that wouldn't do them, or me, any good. So, how to spend my very limited time? The obvious part is being with, and taking care of, my family. While I still can, I embrace every moment with them, and do the logistical things necessary to ease their path into a life without me. The less obvious part is how to teach my children what I would have taught them over the next twenty years. They are too young now to have those conversations. All parents want to teach their children right from wrong, what we think is important, and how to deal with the challenges life will bring. We also want them to know some stories from our own lives,often as a way to teach them how to lead theirs. My desire to do that led me to give a ""last lecture” at Carnegie Mellon University. These lectures are routinely videotaped. I knew what I was doing that day. Under the ruse of giving an academic lecture, I was trying to put myself in a bottle that would one day wash up on the beach for my children. If I were a painter, I would have painted for them. If I were a musician, I would have composed music. But I am a lecturer. So I lectured. I lectured about the joy of life, about how much I appreciated life, even with so little of my own left. I talked about honesty, integrity, gratitude, and other things I hold dear. And I tried very hard not to be boring. This book is a way for me to continue what I began on stage. Because time is precious, and I want to spend all that I can with my kids, I asked Jeffrey Zaslow for help. Each day, I ride my bike around my neighborhood, getting exercise crucial for my health. On fifty-three long bike rides, I spoke to Jeff on my cell-phone headset. He then spent countless hours helping to turn my stories-I suppose we could call them fifty-three ""lectures”-into the book that follows. We knew right from the start: None of this is a replacement for a living parent. But engineering isn't about perfect solutions; it's about doing the best you can with limited resources. Both the lecture and this book are my attempts to do exactly that.",The Last Lecture Lessons In Living,Randy Pausch, , ,Hachette India,9780340977736,"1st Edition,2012",207,India,English

The book is partially based on Bhavna's own story. A young woman has separated from her husband for two years now. She seeks for divorce but cannot do so without her parents permission who obviously do not agree with it. It is not a way of life in the Indian culture and tradition for a woman to leave her husband under any circumstances. It becomes more difficult for her as, as per law, the women would need a mother's approval for divorce. More than her ex and in-laws, it is her parents who are a problem. She eventually decides for herself and goes ahead with a divorce without anyone's approval. This book tells you of all that she had to go through in a society where divorce is a crime where the woman is considered a feminist which is probably worse than a terrorist.",The Diary Of A Reluctant Feminist,Bhavna Bhavna, , ,Hachette India,9789350096710,"1st,2013",248,India,English

Lama Nyima Ozer leaves the monastery he has lived in for nearly his entire life, with his novitiate Tashi in tow. Tashi and Ozer have one purpose. They wish to find the forgotten realm of Shambala.

And there, they meet he golden dakini, Yeshe Nam Lha, daughter of the Goddess Tara; Prince A-KarO, heir to the Lha Empire; and Prince Narasimha heir to the Rigdens and the Shambala legacy. The princes hold the key to saving the world, for one of them must wed Yeshe, and the child of their union is prophesized as the fated Maitreya, the saviour of the world. Tashi and Ozer must lead these characters out of Shambala and into the world, but on the way, they will find their quest almost impossible, for there are many Asurs who wish to thwart them. These demons will do anything they can to prevent the birth of the Maitreya, for he is the fated final form of the Buddha.

Gopal Krishna Gokhale led her to devote her song and speech, thought and dreams to 'the Motherland' and she never wavered in leading or following the cause, right into jail several times. Wise, lyrical and feisty, Sarojini Naidu brought intelligence, energy and intensity to the independence movement. She was the first woman to become President of the Indian National Congress, and later the Governor of Uttar Pradesh. Her frequent ill health never subdued her spirit. Her irreverence was legendary - she was the one who gave Mahatma Gandhi the endearing nickname of 'Mickey Mouse'. A staunch patriot, a unique poet, an efficient administrator, a progressive reformer and a women's activist, she was hailed as a fiery public speaker. It is not surprising then that Women's Day in India is celebrated on the birthday of Sarojini Naidu, a heroine then, and an inspiration now and forever.

Bringing his many conversations over the years into sharper focus than ever before, Walsch encourages readers to cast aside religious and cultural trappings and to build on, broaden and enrich our Ancient Story. But to move forward on this ever-expanding and encompassing spiritual voyage means not only understanding what Walsch considers the most important insights of his Conversations with God, but also applying them in the most practical of ways. And so Walsch has included solid suggestions on how to apply each of the 25 Core Messages in daily life.

With his hilarious flair and blatant voice, Sorabh Pant writes about a girl’s tribulations with the issues of sexual assault and rape in Delhi. As wise politicians and holymen will soon tell you, girls who are raped are merely “asking for it”. They wear skimpy clothes and eat fast food and chow mein, all of which add to their sexual vibes. Women need to take care of how they dress in public, and to do this they may need to ask a certain president’s son for fashion advice. After all, he is only too willing to offer it for free despite his busy schedule. And, of course, there is always the failsafe. Call your would-be rapist “bhaiya” and he will be filled with brotherly remorse, letting you go free. These are all that any woman in Delhi needs to do to avoid being raped. Or, they could just ignore the words of these wise men and kick men right in the family jewels. Angry with the issues of rape, Tanya Bisht decides to do just that, over and under Delhi.

Kashmir has always been a victim of war, and civilians have been paying the price for a war that is not even theirs. And in the 1990s, Kashmir's long war had already started to claim lives. A lot of them went missing and many others lost homes. The Half Mother is a story set in this backdrop. Two of those who go missing are Haleema's father, Ghulam Rasool Joo, and her teenaged son Imran, who is taken away by the authorities. The story brings out the delicate nuances of a deserted woman’s sufferings and torments. Haleema - a daughter and a mother, a 'half mother' who is now an orphan. She is emotionally wrecked, with the uncertainty of her son’s existence distressing her by the minute. While one mother fights and yearns for answers and sets out to find her son in torture camps, jails and morgues, Kashmir is burning in a war that shows no signs of ending any sooner. The Half Mother marks the beginning of a brave new voice from the troubled land of Kashmir, who has brought to us a heart-wrenching, profoundly haunting and lyrical story, reflecting the inhuman effects of war.

But there's more to Ramulamma than her torn sari and the gold stud twinkling on her nose reveal. Through her wisdom and canny intuition, she finds her way around the most intractable problems with the deftest touch. She brings to book a powerful landlord for the rape and murder of a young Dalit girl, saves a falsely accused thief from a miserable fate, and demonstrates to abusive policemen (and occasionally her high-born patrons) in her signature, subtle style the real meaning of duty.
