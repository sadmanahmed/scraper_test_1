About Hossain Al Mamun's Sixes: Six Word Stories one can say: ""He read; was inspired; wrote ingeniously"". The collection he presents to us is proof that you can do quite a lot with very little. A whole life, a telling image, a truth universally acknowledged only when laid bare, verbal and visual wit, some humor, a whiff of poetry – these are some of the gleanings that the perceptive reader will gather from Mamun's collection.",Sixes (Six-Word Stories),Hossain Al Mamun, , ,Jothashilpa, , , ,Bangladesh,English
