Introduced on an experimental basis for a period of five years, the elements of Extension Work as the Adult Education, mass Programme of Functional Literacy, Vocation-based Continuing Education and Population Education. The Scheme was introduced in several Universities in India, during 1989-90.

Notwithstanding the lofty aim to combine the pursuit of higher learning with the socially desired community work to broaden the vision of the teachers and students, the scheme has evoked intense debate because of its linkage with the career advancement, promotion and consequently with higher pay scale. Thus, the questions have been raised as to the desirability of foisting the scheme on unwilling elements in the teaching faculty and students about the efficacy of the role of functionaries, the adequacy of the Orientation Programmes conducted for the functionaries, the extent to which the Teachers, functionaries and Beneficiaries are motivated to participate in the extension work, the difficulties which they encounter in the process and above, whether the scheme attaches greater premium to promotion of social commitment vis-??-vis professional competence.

The above questions from the main focus of the present study which it has endeavoured to answer on the basis of information collected under a survey, from the teaching fraternity, in the University of Poona and its affiliated colleges.

There is hardly any study which evaluates the operation of the ADA-based UEW scheme, in such a comprehensive manner. The present study greatly fulfills the vacuum.",Adult Education and Extension,Jethithor, , ,Aph Publishing Corporation,9788131305263, ,490,India,English

Whittingham) and Plant Respiration (W.Stiles) in the 1950s and have been of great guidance for post-graduate studies in those years. Now great breakthrough have been made with the introduction of isotopes, modern tools and instruments which can project into the cell components and unravel the 'secrets' of plant life, with the results no one book could so completely cover a single topic like photosynthesis or respiration.

In the life science group principles of sciences. One does not need the specialized and deep Knowledge as advocated and contained in the specialized branches of science. Therefore for most of us general science can serve the Purpose well by being science of everyday use and also by being essentially Elementary and simple in comprehension. Science helps us to utilize our leisure purposefully. In addition it makes our lives happy by providing Scientific gadgets for our entertainment in our spare time. Under the former scheme gifted Children in science are provided with a different set of science curriculum quite enriched and advanced in quantity as well as quality as compared with the common curriculum designed for all the students studying physical and life sciences. Text Books occupy a central and prominent place in any scheme of teaching-learning process related to the study of any subject or branches of knowledge. It is why the textbooks are considered quite indispensable at all stages of science education. It can be said beyond doubt that the scientific excursions or trips when organised in systematic and proper way prove quite effective and useful from the point of view of the realization of the aims and objectives of Teaching science. This book contains twenty five chapters including the new trends and Experiments in science teaching, Professional growth of the science and the life History and scientific contribution of Dr. Khurana.
