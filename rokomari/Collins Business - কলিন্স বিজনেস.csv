RamG Vallath is struck down by a hopeless autoimmune disorder while he is doing extremely well in his career. When the symptoms of the illness starts growing, he will be asked to quit his job. It makes his life worse, as the medicines prescribed are expensive and have side effects too. Even when the medication is ineffective, RamG keeps his spirits high and remains to be the one to cheer both his team and his family. Finally, he gets treated in the United States and his disorder is completely cured. Inspired by the whole episode, RamG becomes a motivational speaker, mentor and consultant.

About RamG Vallath

RamG Vallath was born in Kerala. He had an up-and-coming corporate career, having the experience of serving as the COO of Airtel and the director of Dell and HP until he was medically analysed with an autoimmune disorder. It affected his nerves and slowly enfeebled his muscles by the time he was 33. The following decade, while dealing with his failing health, he unrelentingly took complex jobs, still being the most cheerful and humorous person wherever he went. Finally, he found a potential cure for his disorder by undergoing a clinical trial in Chicago. His inspiring talk, Find Your Own Oops in Life, has been inspiring thousands of corporate employees and has also made them laugh heartily.",From Ouch To Oops,Vallath Ramgopal, , ,Collins Business,9789351368175,"1st,2014",160,India,English
