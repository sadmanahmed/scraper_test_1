""Enlightenment""—is it a myth or is it real? In every spiritual tradition, inner explorers have discovered that the liberated state is in fact a natural experience, made possible by the investigation of your own thoughts, feelings, and perceptions.
With The Science of Enlightenment, Shinzen Young provides an uncommonly lucid guide to mindfulness meditation: how it works and how to use it to enhance the richness of all your experiences. For meditators of all levels and beliefs, this many-faceted explanation of the scientific realities of awakening will surprise, illuminate, and inspire.",The Science of Enlightenment,Shinzen Young, , ,Sounds True Inc ,9781683642121,"Reprint,2018",232,India,English
