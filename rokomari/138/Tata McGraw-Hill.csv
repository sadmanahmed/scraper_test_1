This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication. 
The Data Link Layer section covers error detection and corrections, data link control concepts, and Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.

The emphasis of the second edition of this text remains on the basic concepts and applications of physical metallurgy. The level of this edition is also essentially unchanged. The text is still considered appropriate for the teaching of physical metallurgy to students who are not major in metallurgy as well as to engineering students as an introductory course. It has also proved useful for technician training programs in industry. 0 It covers some of the important tools and tests in the field of metallurgy, the section on nondestructive testing has been expanded to include eddy current testing and holography. 0 It covers the fundamentals of plastics deformation and the effect of heat on cold-worked materials remain essentially the same except for an expended discussion of dislocations and fracture. 0 It contains detailed explanation of the theory of age hardening, and more actual phase diagrams as illustrations. The portions on stainless steels now encompass new sections on precipitation- hardening stainless steels, miraging steels, and transforming. The section on cemented carbide tools has been expanded a new section on ceramic tools has been added. 0 Now covers only cast iron and has been enhanced by additional diagrams.",Introduction to Physical Metallurgy,Sidney H Avner, , ,Tata McGraw-Hill,9780074630068,"2nd Edition,1997",696,India,English

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication. 
The Data Link Layer section covers error detection and corrections, data link control concepts, and Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication.

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication. 
The Data Link Layer section covers error detection and corrections, data link control concepts, and Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.

The emphasis of the second edition of this text remains on the basic concepts and applications of physical metallurgy. The level of this edition is also essentially unchanged. The text is still considered appropriate for the teaching of physical metallurgy to students who are not major in metallurgy as well as to engineering students as an introductory course. It has also proved useful for technician training programs in industry. 0 It covers some of the important tools and tests in the field of metallurgy, the section on nondestructive testing has been expanded to include eddy current testing and holography. 0 It covers the fundamentals of plastics deformation and the effect of heat on cold-worked materials remain essentially the same except for an expended discussion of dislocations and fracture. 0 It contains detailed explanation of the theory of age hardening, and more actual phase diagrams as illustrations. The portions on stainless steels now encompass new sections on precipitation- hardening stainless steels, miraging steels, and transforming. The section on cemented carbide tools has been expanded a new section on ceramic tools has been added. 0 Now covers only cast iron and has been enhanced by additional diagrams.",Introduction to Physical Metallurgy,Sidney H Avner, , ,Tata McGraw-Hill,9780074630068,"2nd Edition,1997",696,India,English

The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered.

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication.

The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication. 
The Data Link Layer section covers error detection and corrections, data link control concepts, and Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication. 
The Data Link Layer section covers error detection and corrections, data link control concepts, and Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.

The emphasis of the second edition of this text remains on the basic concepts and applications of physical metallurgy. The level of this edition is also essentially unchanged. The text is still considered appropriate for the teaching of physical metallurgy to students who are not major in metallurgy as well as to engineering students as an introductory course. It has also proved useful for technician training programs in industry. 0 It covers some of the important tools and tests in the field of metallurgy, the section on nondestructive testing has been expanded to include eddy current testing and holography. 0 It covers the fundamentals of plastics deformation and the effect of heat on cold-worked materials remain essentially the same except for an expended discussion of dislocations and fracture. 0 It contains detailed explanation of the theory of age hardening, and more actual phase diagrams as illustrations. The portions on stainless steels now encompass new sections on precipitation- hardening stainless steels, miraging steels, and transforming. The section on cemented carbide tools has been expanded a new section on ceramic tools has been added. 0 Now covers only cast iron and has been enhanced by additional diagrams.",Introduction to Physical Metallurgy,Sidney H Avner, , ,Tata McGraw-Hill,9780074630068,"2nd Edition,1997",696,India,English

The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication.

The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication. 
The Data Link Layer section covers error detection and corrections, data link control concepts, and Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication. 
The Data Link Layer section covers error detection and corrections, data link control concepts, and Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication. 
The Data Link Layer section covers error detection and corrections, data link control concepts, and Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.

The emphasis of the second edition of this text remains on the basic concepts and applications of physical metallurgy. The level of this edition is also essentially unchanged. The text is still considered appropriate for the teaching of physical metallurgy to students who are not major in metallurgy as well as to engineering students as an introductory course. It has also proved useful for technician training programs in industry. 0 It covers some of the important tools and tests in the field of metallurgy, the section on nondestructive testing has been expanded to include eddy current testing and holography. 0 It covers the fundamentals of plastics deformation and the effect of heat on cold-worked materials remain essentially the same except for an expended discussion of dislocations and fracture. 0 It contains detailed explanation of the theory of age hardening, and more actual phase diagrams as illustrations. The portions on stainless steels now encompass new sections on precipitation- hardening stainless steels, miraging steels, and transforming. The section on cemented carbide tools has been expanded a new section on ceramic tools has been added. 0 Now covers only cast iron and has been enhanced by additional diagrams.",Introduction to Physical Metallurgy,Sidney H Avner, , ,Tata McGraw-Hill,9780074630068,"2nd Edition,1997",696,India,English

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication.

The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication. 
The Data Link Layer section covers error detection and corrections, data link control concepts, and Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication. 
The Data Link Layer section covers error detection and corrections, data link control concepts, and Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication. 
The Data Link Layer section covers error detection and corrections, data link control concepts, and Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.

The emphasis of the second edition of this text remains on the basic concepts and applications of physical metallurgy. The level of this edition is also essentially unchanged. The text is still considered appropriate for the teaching of physical metallurgy to students who are not major in metallurgy as well as to engineering students as an introductory course. It has also proved useful for technician training programs in industry. 0 It covers some of the important tools and tests in the field of metallurgy, the section on nondestructive testing has been expanded to include eddy current testing and holography. 0 It covers the fundamentals of plastics deformation and the effect of heat on cold-worked materials remain essentially the same except for an expended discussion of dislocations and fracture. 0 It contains detailed explanation of the theory of age hardening, and more actual phase diagrams as illustrations. The portions on stainless steels now encompass new sections on precipitation- hardening stainless steels, miraging steels, and transforming. The section on cemented carbide tools has been expanded a new section on ceramic tools has been added. 0 Now covers only cast iron and has been enhanced by additional diagrams.",Introduction to Physical Metallurgy,Sidney H Avner, , ,Tata McGraw-Hill,9780074630068,"2nd Edition,1997",696,India,English

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication. 
The Data Link Layer section covers error detection and corrections, data link control concepts, and Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication.

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication. 
The Data Link Layer section covers error detection and corrections, data link control concepts, and Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.

The emphasis of the second edition of this text remains on the basic concepts and applications of physical metallurgy. The level of this edition is also essentially unchanged. The text is still considered appropriate for the teaching of physical metallurgy to students who are not major in metallurgy as well as to engineering students as an introductory course. It has also proved useful for technician training programs in industry. 0 It covers some of the important tools and tests in the field of metallurgy, the section on nondestructive testing has been expanded to include eddy current testing and holography. 0 It covers the fundamentals of plastics deformation and the effect of heat on cold-worked materials remain essentially the same except for an expended discussion of dislocations and fracture. 0 It contains detailed explanation of the theory of age hardening, and more actual phase diagrams as illustrations. The portions on stainless steels now encompass new sections on precipitation- hardening stainless steels, miraging steels, and transforming. The section on cemented carbide tools has been expanded a new section on ceramic tools has been added. 0 Now covers only cast iron and has been enhanced by additional diagrams.",Introduction to Physical Metallurgy,Sidney H Avner, , ,Tata McGraw-Hill,9780074630068,"2nd Edition,1997",696,India,English

The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered.

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication.

The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.

This book provides a detailed look at the subject and covers everything, right from the basics of the subject of data communication and networking. Its bottom-up approach makes this book appropriate even for students who do not have any knowledge of networking or telecommunication.
With the explosive increase in the usage of computers and networking systems, data communication and networking technologies are advancing at a fast pace. As the use of these technologies has become increasingly common, the need to cultivate an understanding of these technologies is also on the increase. 
Students and professionals from various study streams, specializations, and backgrounds now take courses on data communication and networking. Not all of them may have previous knowledge of data communication and telecommunication concepts, and keeping this in mind, this book begins with the basics of the technology and slowly builds on the same. 
This book uses the five layer TCP/IP protocol suite as the framework for the text. It begins with an introduction to the technologies of networking and data communication. The section provides an overview of network topologies, types of networks, and an overview of the Internet. The next chapter focuses on the major network protocols, OSI and TCP/IP. 
Further, the book has been divided into sections that talk about the five layers of Internet architecture - the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. 
The Physical Layer section explains aspects of telecommunication that are relevant to the Physical Layer. It takes a look at transmission media and switching and provides an overview of how telephone and cable TV networks can be used for data communication. 
The Data Link Layer section covers error detection and corrections, data link control concepts, and Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). The Network Layer section focuses on topics like IP address and Network Layer protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP. This section also explains delivery, routing, and forwarding of data packets. 
The Transport Layer section provides an overview of the functionalities of this layer. It provides an introduction to the transport layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and SCTP.The section also discusses the issues of congestion and quality of service. 
The Application Layer section focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS). This technology is used to map application layer addresses to network layer addresses. It also takes a look at the World Wide Web (WWW) and the HTTP and SNMP protocols. The section also explains remote logging, e-mail, and file transfer
There is a separate section on security in this book, and it discusses topics like cryptography, network security, and Internet-related security concepts like firewalls, VPN, SSL/TLS etc. 
The book has a large number of illustrations and pictures that greatly help in explaining the concepts covered. The author uses real-life examples in relevant sections and important points are emphasized in highlighted boxes. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, practice sets of questions and exercises, and a section on recommended reading for further knowledge on the topics covered. 
The Appendix contains review and quick reference material. The book ends with a comprehensive set of glossary and acronyms.
