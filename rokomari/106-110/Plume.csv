Hindu legends and epics contain so many interesting characters, that it is difficult to keep track of all of them even for a person who is familiar with Hindu epics. It can get pretty confusing for someone who is new to the world of Hindu beliefs and traditions.

The Little Book Of Hindu Deities, written and illustrated by a Pixar animator, provides an informal and perky introduction to various Hindu Gods. Along with cute illustrations and colorful text, the descriptions are lighthearted and informative.

The tales of the Hindu Gods involve everything from romance to wars, with the supporting characters ranging from divine beings to monsters. These interesting stories are recounted with verve and humor in this book. It answers questions like why Goddess Kali is black and why Ganesha has an elephant head. It contains vivid and short profiles of not just the more well known gods, like Vishnu, Shiva, Rama and Krishna, but also deities like Agni and Garuda.

The book contains tales of all the Gods and Goddesses with captivating illustrations that evoke the Japanese cartoon style. The images are all innocent faced with huge wide eyed cuteness, including those of the fierce deities like Kali and Bhairava. Each deity is covered in two pages, one page containing the illustration and the other, the story of that God. The information provided is short and full of humor, appealing to a new generation of readers.

The Little Book Of Hindu Deities not only covers stories of Gods and Goddesses, but it also introduces major epics. So along with the stories of Lakshmi and Saraswati, readers are also introduced to the stories of Rama and Sita, the great epic Mahabharata, and the interesting philosophical work, the Bhagavad Gita.
