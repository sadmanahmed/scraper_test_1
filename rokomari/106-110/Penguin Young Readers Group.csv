David Copperfield is the story of a young man's adventures on his journey from an unhappy and impoverished childhood to the discovery of his vocation as a successful novelist. Among the gloriously vivid cast of characters he encounters are his tyrannical stepfather, Mr Murdstone; his brilliant, but ultimately unworthy school-friend James Steerforth; his formidable aunt, Betsey Trotwood; the eternally humble, yet treacherous Uriah Heep; frivolous, enchanting Dora Spenlow; and the magnificently impecunious Wilkins Micawber, one of literature's great comic creations. In David Copperfield - the novel he described as his 'favourite child' - Dickens drew revealingly on his own experiences to create one of the most exuberant and enduringly popular works, filled with tragedy and comedy in equal measure. This edition uses the text of the first volume publication of 1850, and includes updated suggestions for further reading, original illustrations by 'Phiz', a revised chronology and expanded notes. In his new introduction, Jeremy Tambling discusses the novel's autobiographical elements, and its central themes of memory and identity.

About the Author
Charles Dickens was born on February 7, 1812, in Landport, Portsea, England. He died in Kent on June 9, 1870. The second of eight children of a family continually plagued by debt, the young Dickens came to know not only hunger and privation,but also the horror of the infamous debtors’ prison and the evils of child labor. A turn of fortune in the shape of a legacy brought release from the nightmare of prison and “slave” factories and afforded Dickens the opportunity of two years’ formal schooling at Wellington House Academy. He worked as an attorney’s clerk and newspaper reporter until his Sketches by Boz (1836) and The Pickwick Papers (1837) brought him the amazing and instant success that was to be his for the remainder of his life. In later years, the pressure of serial writing, editorial duties, lectures, and social commitments led to his separation from Catherine Hogarth after twenty-three years of marriage. It also hastened his death at the age of fifty-eight, when he was characteristically engaged in a multitude of work.",Great Expectations : Puffin Classic,Charles Dickens, , ,Penguin Young Readers Group,9780141330136,"Edition,2011",493,India,English

Two weeks after his classmate Hannah Baker commits suicide, Clay Jensen, the ""nice"" boy who had loved her from afar, finds ""a shoebox-sized package"" on his porch. The box contains seven audiotapes, with each side numbered separately from one to thirteen. The tapes, created by Hannah, are to be passed on, in order, to a list of individuals whose names all appear on the recordings. Hannah promises that the tapes will explain why she took her life, and she warns that each of those who receive a tape contributed in some way to her death.

Hannah names Justin Foley, her ""freshman crush,"" first on the tapes. She concedes that he, like most of the people named, had no idea about the significance of his actions, but in the end, everything added up to ""betrayal...one of the worst feelings."" Hannah had long dreamed of receiving her first kiss on a playground rocket ship, and Justin made her innocent dream come true. Sadly, he then bragged to his friends about what had happened, embellishing the details, and starting rumors having little resemblance to the truth.

Alex Standall and Jessica Davis are the next students implicated on the tapes. Hannah, Jessica, and Alex had enjoyed hanging out at a coffeehouse during their freshman year, and Alex and Jessica had began a romantic relationship that quickly went sour. In a mean-spirited joke aimed at hurting Jessica, Alex created a ""Who's Hot/Who's Not"" list and distributed it among the students at school. Alex put Hannah at the top of the list entitled ""Best Ass in the Freshman Class,"" with Jessica opposite her under ""Worst Ass."" Hannah knew it was a joke, but the repercussions for her were severe. Jessica, humiliated, struck Hannah, leaving a scar on her forehead, and, by naming Hannah ""Best Ass,"" Alex had unintentionally affected the way people looked at her, giving some ""the go-ahead to treat (her) like (she was) nothing but that specific body part."" Hannah was subsequently groped by an arrogant upperclassman at a local convenience store.

Tyler Down hastened the destruction of Hannah's world when he stripped her of privacy and security by surreptitiously photographing her from beneath her bedroom window. When Hannah realized that she was being watched, she confided in Courtney Crimsen, a popular classmate with a reputation for being a good friend, only to discover that the girl was not what she seemed to be. Courtney went to Hannah's house and initiated a salacious scene with her to distract Tyler before exposing him as a Peeping Tom. Hannah had hoped that after this escapade, Courtney and she might become friends, but instead, Courtney ignored her until she finally invited Hannah to go to a party because she needed a ride. Courtney ditched Hannah as soon as they arrived, and later sent a boy over to approach Hannah after telling him provocative lies based on Hannah's false reputation as an easy sexual conquest.

Subsequent experiences intensified Hannah's isolation and contributed to her downward spiral. The cheerleaders at school ran a Valentine's Day fundraiser in which students were to complete a survey expressing their preferences in a mate, then pay to discover whom a computer matched them with. Hannah was paired with ""goof-off"" Marcus Cooley, who facetiously asked her out on a date. Calling his bluff, Hannah accepted, but while Hannah went to Rosie's, their agreed-upon meeting place, at the designated time, Marcus arrived late, with an ""endgame"" in mind. Marcus maneuvered Hannah into a secluded booth and, encouraged by the false rumors that she could not escape, tried to make ""a move on her""; when Hannah fought back, he loudly called her ""a tease"" and left. As Hannah sat alone, crushed, Zach Dempsey, a classmate who had been sitting with a group at another table, came over to see if Hannah was all right; when Hannah did not respond, he returned to his friends. Immediately afterward, Hannah, eavesdropping, learned that Zach had come to her table on a dare, trying to get a date. The next day, Hannah gave up on ever being able to...",Thirteen Reasons Why,Jay Asher, , ,Penguin Young Readers Group,9781595141880,"Reprint edition,2011",336,India,English

Roald Dahl’s The Magic Finger is a rollicking account of a hunting trip that goes amuck. This grossly imaginative tale is told from the viewpoint of a highly opinionated eight-year-old girl, the story’s unnamed narrator. The book is short, containing only forty-one pages in its original edition. The text is interspersed with William Pène du Bois’ fanciful black-and-white sketches of the comedic events and whimsical characters described by the author. Some of these illustrations unobtrusively fit into a quarter of a page, or less, leaving the remainder of the page for text; other drawings completely dominate a two-page spread.

The setting for the story is quickly established. Two young boys, whose last name is Gregg, live next door to the eight-year-old narrator. The girl “just can’t stand” hunting, and the boys next door and their father hunt both animals and birds: “Even Philip, who was only eight years old, had a gun of his own.” Adding intrigue to these rather ordinary circumstances is the unusual “gift” that the girl possesses—a magic finger.

The girl does not understand this gift; she only knows that she has always possessed it. It is activated when she becomes angry. A jolt of something akin to electrical power is released from her finger and lands on the person who has angered her, causing all sorts of outrageous things to happen—things over which she has no control. Therefore, when the Greggs...",The Magic Finger,Roald Dahl, , ,Penguin Young Readers Group,9780141365404,Edition 2016,80,India,English

Washington Irving’s short story “Rip Van Winkle” was published in 1819 and 1820 in The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. Like other short stories in The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent., Irving uses the character of Geoffrey Crayon to narrate. The story of “Rip Van Winkle” is also backed up by a fictional historian named Diedrich Knickerbocker. Irving previously used Diedrich Knickerbocker’s character to publish A History of New York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, a hoax history book which fooled many readers. Knickerbocker is an unreliable character. His presence reminds readers to question the truthfulness of the supposedly historical narrative at hand. However, although shaped like a folktale, “Rip Van Winkle” is still based on some truth. For example, the setting is under the Catskill Mountains and on the Hudson River—both real and prominent places in New York state. Additionally, the inclusion of Henry Hudson, who was a Dutch explorer in the late 1500s, brings an element of truth and realism to “Rip Van Winkle.”

Who was Amen-Ra and how did he create the entire world and its inhabitants? Was he the ultimate god? How did the vulnerable Isis go hunting for her dead husband Osiris in the waters? Did the Bennu bird also emerge like the phoenix?

All these amazing stories and more is what Tales of Ancient Egypt chronicles for its readers. A beautiful mosaic of ancient Egyptian legends interspersed with fascinating mythological characters, the book is a wonderful and gripping read for one and all.

The reader embarks on a riveting journey with the author, bringing to life the world of ancient Egypt with its enthralling tales. A repertoire of stories from the primal land of Egypt, Tales of Ancient Egypt describes the actions of Egyptian gods, heroes and other mythological characters through its impressive narration.

The book, a primer on Egyptian mythology, also brings forth some delightful legends, like that of the girl with the red-rose slippers, considered to be the earliest and the oldest version of the timeless Cinderella story.

A delightful and entertaining experience, Tales of Ancient Egypt, first published in 1967, uses the art of storytelling to recreate the enchanting world of the ancient city of Egypt and the endeavours of its champions. The book is also regarded as a quintessential contribution to the study of this glorious civilisation.

David Copperfield is the story of a young man's adventures on his journey from an unhappy and impoverished childhood to the discovery of his vocation as a successful novelist. Among the gloriously vivid cast of characters he encounters are his tyrannical stepfather, Mr Murdstone; his brilliant, but ultimately unworthy school-friend James Steerforth; his formidable aunt, Betsey Trotwood; the eternally humble, yet treacherous Uriah Heep; frivolous, enchanting Dora Spenlow; and the magnificently impecunious Wilkins Micawber, one of literature's great comic creations. In David Copperfield - the novel he described as his 'favourite child' - Dickens drew revealingly on his own experiences to create one of the most exuberant and enduringly popular works, filled with tragedy and comedy in equal measure. This edition uses the text of the first volume publication of 1850, and includes updated suggestions for further reading, original illustrations by 'Phiz', a revised chronology and expanded notes. In his new introduction, Jeremy Tambling discusses the novel's autobiographical elements, and its central themes of memory and identity. 

For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

About the Author
Charles Dickens was born on February 7, 1812, in Landport, Portsea, England. He died in Kent on June 9, 1870. The second of eight children of a family continually plagued by debt, the young Dickens came to know not only hunger and privation,but also the horror of the infamous debtors’ prison and the evils of child labor. A turn of fortune in the shape of a legacy brought release from the nightmare of prison and “slave” factories and afforded Dickens the opportunity of two years’ formal schooling at Wellington House Academy. He worked as an attorney’s clerk and newspaper reporter until his Sketches by Boz (1836) and The Pickwick Papers (1837) brought him the amazing and instant success that was to be his for the remainder of his life. In later years, the pressure of serial writing, editorial duties, lectures, and social commitments led to his separation from Catherine Hogarth after twenty-three years of marriage. It also hastened his death at the age of fifty-eight, when he was characteristically engaged in a multitude of work.",Great Expectations : Puffin Classic,Charles Dickens, , ,Penguin Young Readers Group,9780141330136,"Edition,2011",493,India,English

Two weeks after his classmate Hannah Baker commits suicide, Clay Jensen, the ""nice"" boy who had loved her from afar, finds ""a shoebox-sized package"" on his porch. The box contains seven audiotapes, with each side numbered separately from one to thirteen. The tapes, created by Hannah, are to be passed on, in order, to a list of individuals whose names all appear on the recordings. Hannah promises that the tapes will explain why she took her life, and she warns that each of those who receive a tape contributed in some way to her death.

Hannah names Justin Foley, her ""freshman crush,"" first on the tapes. She concedes that he, like most of the people named, had no idea about the significance of his actions, but in the end, everything added up to ""betrayal...one of the worst feelings."" Hannah had long dreamed of receiving her first kiss on a playground rocket ship, and Justin made her innocent dream come true. Sadly, he then bragged to his friends about what had happened, embellishing the details, and starting rumors having little resemblance to the truth.

Alex Standall and Jessica Davis are the next students implicated on the tapes. Hannah, Jessica, and Alex had enjoyed hanging out at a coffeehouse during their freshman year, and Alex and Jessica had began a romantic relationship that quickly went sour. In a mean-spirited joke aimed at hurting Jessica, Alex created a ""Who's Hot/Who's Not"" list and distributed it among the students at school. Alex put Hannah at the top of the list entitled ""Best Ass in the Freshman Class,"" with Jessica opposite her under ""Worst Ass."" Hannah knew it was a joke, but the repercussions for her were severe. Jessica, humiliated, struck Hannah, leaving a scar on her forehead, and, by naming Hannah ""Best Ass,"" Alex had unintentionally affected the way people looked at her, giving some ""the go-ahead to treat (her) like (she was) nothing but that specific body part."" Hannah was subsequently groped by an arrogant upperclassman at a local convenience store.

Tyler Down hastened the destruction of Hannah's world when he stripped her of privacy and security by surreptitiously photographing her from beneath her bedroom window. When Hannah realized that she was being watched, she confided in Courtney Crimsen, a popular classmate with a reputation for being a good friend, only to discover that the girl was not what she seemed to be. Courtney went to Hannah's house and initiated a salacious scene with her to distract Tyler before exposing him as a Peeping Tom. Hannah had hoped that after this escapade, Courtney and she might become friends, but instead, Courtney ignored her until she finally invited Hannah to go to a party because she needed a ride. Courtney ditched Hannah as soon as they arrived, and later sent a boy over to approach Hannah after telling him provocative lies based on Hannah's false reputation as an easy sexual conquest.

Subsequent experiences intensified Hannah's isolation and contributed to her downward spiral. The cheerleaders at school ran a Valentine's Day fundraiser in which students were to complete a survey expressing their preferences in a mate, then pay to discover whom a computer matched them with. Hannah was paired with ""goof-off"" Marcus Cooley, who facetiously asked her out on a date. Calling his bluff, Hannah accepted, but while Hannah went to Rosie's, their agreed-upon meeting place, at the designated time, Marcus arrived late, with an ""endgame"" in mind. Marcus maneuvered Hannah into a secluded booth and, encouraged by the false rumors that she could not escape, tried to make ""a move on her""; when Hannah fought back, he loudly called her ""a tease"" and left. As Hannah sat alone, crushed, Zach Dempsey, a classmate who had been sitting with a group at another table, came over to see if Hannah was all right; when Hannah did not respond, he returned to his friends. Immediately afterward, Hannah, eavesdropping, learned that Zach had come to her table on a dare, trying to get a date. The next day, Hannah gave up on ever being able to...",Thirteen Reasons Why,Jay Asher, , ,Penguin Young Readers Group,9781595141880,"Reprint edition,2011",336,India,English

Roald Dahl’s The Magic Finger is a rollicking account of a hunting trip that goes amuck. This grossly imaginative tale is told from the viewpoint of a highly opinionated eight-year-old girl, the story’s unnamed narrator. The book is short, containing only forty-one pages in its original edition. The text is interspersed with William Pène du Bois’ fanciful black-and-white sketches of the comedic events and whimsical characters described by the author. Some of these illustrations unobtrusively fit into a quarter of a page, or less, leaving the remainder of the page for text; other drawings completely dominate a two-page spread.

The setting for the story is quickly established. Two young boys, whose last name is Gregg, live next door to the eight-year-old narrator. The girl “just can’t stand” hunting, and the boys next door and their father hunt both animals and birds: “Even Philip, who was only eight years old, had a gun of his own.” Adding intrigue to these rather ordinary circumstances is the unusual “gift” that the girl possesses—a magic finger.

The girl does not understand this gift; she only knows that she has always possessed it. It is activated when she becomes angry. A jolt of something akin to electrical power is released from her finger and lands on the person who has angered her, causing all sorts of outrageous things to happen—things over which she has no control. Therefore, when the Greggs...",The Magic Finger,Roald Dahl, , ,Penguin Young Readers Group,9780141365404,Edition 2016,80,India,English

Washington Irving’s short story “Rip Van Winkle” was published in 1819 and 1820 in The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. Like other short stories in The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent., Irving uses the character of Geoffrey Crayon to narrate. The story of “Rip Van Winkle” is also backed up by a fictional historian named Diedrich Knickerbocker. Irving previously used Diedrich Knickerbocker’s character to publish A History of New York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, a hoax history book which fooled many readers. Knickerbocker is an unreliable character. His presence reminds readers to question the truthfulness of the supposedly historical narrative at hand. However, although shaped like a folktale, “Rip Van Winkle” is still based on some truth. For example, the setting is under the Catskill Mountains and on the Hudson River—both real and prominent places in New York state. Additionally, the inclusion of Henry Hudson, who was a Dutch explorer in the late 1500s, brings an element of truth and realism to “Rip Van Winkle.”

Who was Amen-Ra and how did he create the entire world and its inhabitants? Was he the ultimate god? How did the vulnerable Isis go hunting for her dead husband Osiris in the waters? Did the Bennu bird also emerge like the phoenix?

All these amazing stories and more is what Tales of Ancient Egypt chronicles for its readers. A beautiful mosaic of ancient Egyptian legends interspersed with fascinating mythological characters, the book is a wonderful and gripping read for one and all.

The reader embarks on a riveting journey with the author, bringing to life the world of ancient Egypt with its enthralling tales. A repertoire of stories from the primal land of Egypt, Tales of Ancient Egypt describes the actions of Egyptian gods, heroes and other mythological characters through its impressive narration.

The book, a primer on Egyptian mythology, also brings forth some delightful legends, like that of the girl with the red-rose slippers, considered to be the earliest and the oldest version of the timeless Cinderella story.

A delightful and entertaining experience, Tales of Ancient Egypt, first published in 1967, uses the art of storytelling to recreate the enchanting world of the ancient city of Egypt and the endeavours of its champions. The book is also regarded as a quintessential contribution to the study of this glorious civilisation.
