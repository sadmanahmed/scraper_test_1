The first edition discussed six types of structures of different functions, namely: 
(a) An underground sedimentation tank for sewage treatment. 
(b) An underground digestion tank for sludge treatment. 
(c) An underground reservoir to store fresh potable water, 
(d) An immersed highway tunnel under the river bed. 
(e) An indoor swimming pool of rectangular shape for public recreation. 
(f) A gravity dam across a valley for converting the valley into a fresh water reservoir.
This Second Edition incorporates another type of hydraulic structure, namely spillway. The spillway structure plays a vital role in regulating the designed reservoir water level to meet the fluctuating demand of water supply for generation of electricity, and for irrigation and water supply purposes. The spillway structure, subjected to seismic hydrodynamic pressure in addition to the hydrostatic pressure, has been analysed and designed in full compliance with Eurocodes EC 2: Part 1-1 and Part 3 as a water-retaining structure. The other six structures have been analysed and designed with reference to the relevant codes of practice prescribed in Eurocodes 2. BS 8007 and BS 8110. The book is designed to serve as a useful practical guide and a valuable reference for senior undergraduate students of civil engineering and for postgraduate students specializing in structural design, as well as practising and consulting engineers involved in the design and execution of hydraulic concrete structures.",Analysis and Design: Practice of Hydraulic Concrete Structures,Karuna Moy Ghosh, , ,PHI Learning,9788120345942,"3rd Printed,2015",166,India,English

This textbook offers a comprehensive and wide-ranging introduction to theoretical principles and practical aspects of refrigeration and air conditioning systems. Written by an outstanding teacher with 30 years of distinguished career at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, this work created by late Dr. R.C. Arora (1945–2005) is intended to lead students to a deeper understanding and a firm grasp of the basic principles of this fast-growing and exciting subject area. This text is ideally suited for undergraduate education in mechanical engineering programmes and specialized postgraduate education in thermosciences. The book is designed to typically appeal to those who like a more rigorous presentation.
The text begins by reviewing, in a simple and precise manner, the physical principles of three pillars of Refrigeration and Air Conditioning, namely thermodynamics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics. Following an overview of the history of refrigeration, subsequent chapters provide exhaustive coverage of the principles, applications and design of several types of refrigeration systems and their associated components such as compressors, condensers, evaporators, and expansion devices. Refrigerants too, are studied elaboratively in an exclusive chapter.
The second part of the book, beginning with the historical background of air conditioning in Chapter 15, discusses the subject of psychrometrics being at the heart of understanding the design and implementation of air conditioning processes and systems, which are subsequently dealt with in Chapters 16 to 23. It also explains the design practices followed for cooling and heating load calculations.
Each chapter contains several worked-out examples that clarify the material discussed and illustrate the use of basic principles in engineering applications. Each chapter also ends with a set of few review questions to serve as revision of the material learned.

An Introduction to Neural Networks falls into a new ecological niche for texts. Based on notes that have been class-tested for more than a decade, it is aimed at cognitive science and neuroscience students who need to understand brain function in terms of computational modeling and at engineers who want to go beyond formal algorithms to applications and computing strategies. It is the only current text to approach networks from a broad neuroscience and cognitive science perspective, with an emphasis on the biology and psychology behind the assumptions of the models, as well as on what the models might be used for. It describes the mathematical and computational tools needed and provides an account of the author's own ideas.

Key Features
•	Emphasizes not so much on the formal analysis of network algorithms as on the use of algorithms.
•	Devotes some effort to describe the biological represent-ration of data by giving some examples of biological and cognitive computation using neural networks.
•	The beginning of the book contains programs for some computer modeling experiments to enable students to play with algorithms and theories.
•	Provides fragments of code, useful Pascal procedures and functions, and describes results from networks modeling programs, throughout the text.
•	The After word tells how to obtain the complete programs, datasets and further details about the operation and design of the programs.

The aim of this widely used book, now in its third edition, is to introduce readers to the PSpice version of the SPICE simulator. SPICE is very popular software for analyzing electrical and electronic circuits. The MicroSim Corporation first introduced the PSpice simulator, which can run on personal computers (Pcs). This book is primarily intended as a text for the undergraduate core course on environmental science and for undergraduate honours courses in ecology, environmental biology as well as for postgraduate courses in environmental biology, ecology, and pollution ecology. In addition, the book would also be useful for students appearing in different competitive examinations. This book is the outcome of the author's experience in integrating SPICE in circuits and electronic courses for undergraduate electrical, electronics and computer engineering students. It can be used either as a textbook on SPICE or as a supplement to any standard textbook on basic circuits or electronics. The book begins by describing techniques for simulating circuits, then presents the various SPICE and OrCAD commands and their appli-cations to electrical and electronic circuits. The third edition includes more hands-on exercises, suggestions, sample problems, and circuit models of actual devices.

The first edition discussed six types of structures of different functions, namely: 
(a) An underground sedimentation tank for sewage treatment. 
(b) An underground digestion tank for sludge treatment. 
(c) An underground reservoir to store fresh potable water, 
(d) An immersed highway tunnel under the river bed. 
(e) An indoor swimming pool of rectangular shape for public recreation. 
(f) A gravity dam across a valley for converting the valley into a fresh water reservoir.
This Second Edition incorporates another type of hydraulic structure, namely spillway. The spillway structure plays a vital role in regulating the designed reservoir water level to meet the fluctuating demand of water supply for generation of electricity, and for irrigation and water supply purposes. The spillway structure, subjected to seismic hydrodynamic pressure in addition to the hydrostatic pressure, has been analysed and designed in full compliance with Eurocodes EC 2: Part 1-1 and Part 3 as a water-retaining structure. The other six structures have been analysed and designed with reference to the relevant codes of practice prescribed in Eurocodes 2. BS 8007 and BS 8110. The book is designed to serve as a useful practical guide and a valuable reference for senior undergraduate students of civil engineering and for postgraduate students specializing in structural design, as well as practising and consulting engineers involved in the design and execution of hydraulic concrete structures.",Analysis and Design: Practice of Hydraulic Concrete Structures,Karuna Moy Ghosh, , ,PHI Learning,9788120345942,"3rd Printed,2015",166,India,English

This textbook offers a comprehensive and wide-ranging introduction to theoretical principles and practical aspects of refrigeration and air conditioning systems. Written by an outstanding teacher with 30 years of distinguished career at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, this work created by late Dr. R.C. Arora (1945–2005) is intended to lead students to a deeper understanding and a firm grasp of the basic principles of this fast-growing and exciting subject area. This text is ideally suited for undergraduate education in mechanical engineering programmes and specialized postgraduate education in thermosciences. The book is designed to typically appeal to those who like a more rigorous presentation.
The text begins by reviewing, in a simple and precise manner, the physical principles of three pillars of Refrigeration and Air Conditioning, namely thermodynamics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics. Following an overview of the history of refrigeration, subsequent chapters provide exhaustive coverage of the principles, applications and design of several types of refrigeration systems and their associated components such as compressors, condensers, evaporators, and expansion devices. Refrigerants too, are studied elaboratively in an exclusive chapter.
The second part of the book, beginning with the historical background of air conditioning in Chapter 15, discusses the subject of psychrometrics being at the heart of understanding the design and implementation of air conditioning processes and systems, which are subsequently dealt with in Chapters 16 to 23. It also explains the design practices followed for cooling and heating load calculations.
Each chapter contains several worked-out examples that clarify the material discussed and illustrate the use of basic principles in engineering applications. Each chapter also ends with a set of few review questions to serve as revision of the material learned.

An Introduction to Neural Networks falls into a new ecological niche for texts. Based on notes that have been class-tested for more than a decade, it is aimed at cognitive science and neuroscience students who need to understand brain function in terms of computational modeling and at engineers who want to go beyond formal algorithms to applications and computing strategies. It is the only current text to approach networks from a broad neuroscience and cognitive science perspective, with an emphasis on the biology and psychology behind the assumptions of the models, as well as on what the models might be used for. It describes the mathematical and computational tools needed and provides an account of the author's own ideas.

Key Features
•	Emphasizes not so much on the formal analysis of network algorithms as on the use of algorithms.
•	Devotes some effort to describe the biological represent-ration of data by giving some examples of biological and cognitive computation using neural networks.

Analysis and Design of Information Systems ,ভি. রাজারমান,TK. 531,"",https://rokomari.com//book/92640/analysis-and-design-of-information-systems-,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/rokimg_20150115_92640.gif,"One of the most important uses of computers is (as an aid to managers) to provide up-to-date information to efficiently run their organizations. Of the total number of computers installed in the world today, over eighty percent are used in organizations for management information systems. It is thus very important for all students of management, commerce and computer science to know how to design computer-based information systems to aid management. This introductory text gives a lucid, self-contained presentation to students on how to analyse and design information systems for use by managers.

Information Systems Analysis and Design (also known as System Analysis and Design) is a compulsory subject for MCA, BCA, B.Com. and B.E. students of Computer Science and Information Technology. This book covers the syllabus of this course and that of the DOEACC (Level A) examination.

Thoroughly classroom tested and evolved out of twenty years of teaching Information Systems Design course at IIT Kanpur and IISc., Bangalore, this book presents real Indian examples.

In this third edition every chapter has been updated, besides the addition of a new chapter on Use Case Method to reflect the rapid changes taking place in designing information systems.

This book has been used to prepare learning material for the course Systems Analysis and Design for the National Programme for Technology Enhanced Learning of the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India. The author has delivered 40 lectures on this topic which are available on YouTube. Besides, the book also contains supplementary materials such as PPTs and objective questions which are available on www.phindia.com/rajaraman_ADIS.

Key Features
• Covers comprehensively systems analysis and design.
• Discusses object-oriented modelling of information systems.
• A chapter on Electronic Commerce is unique to this book.
• Presents a detailed case study of a complete information system.
• Includes supplementary web material.
