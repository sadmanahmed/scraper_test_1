The Communist Manifesto, which was originally titled as Manifesto of the Communist Party, is an influential political manuscript that lays out the Communist League’s aims and program. The Manifesto presents an analytical insight into the class struggle of the historical and contemporary era. The book also highlights the problems of capitalism.

The Communist Manifesto is divided into 4 sections. The first part is Bourgeois and Proletarians. It focuses on the Communist theory of the history and relation between the Bourgeois and the Proletarians. The next section, Proletarians and Communists, attempts to understand the relationship between Proletarians and Communists. The third part discusses the Socialist and Communist Literature and their flaws. The final part discusses the position of the Communists and its relation to the other opposition parties.

This edition of The Communist Manifesto has been edited by Gareth Stedman Jones. In this edition, he discusses The Reception of the Manifesto, The Communist League, The Spectre of Communism, and Engel’s and Marx’s contributions. Gareth Stedman Jones also discusses the The Young Hegelians including Hegel and Hegelianism, the Emergence of the Young Hegelians, and the Battle over Christianity. It also discuses the Political Economy, Communism, The True Natural History of Man, The Impact of Stirner, and the transformation from Republicanism to Communism.
Written after 4 years of collaboration between Engel and Marx, The Communist Manifesto was originally written in German and published on 21 February 1848. When it was originally published, it raised much controversy. Today, it is an important manifesto, a powerful historical document, and an important classical work.

Over the next forty years, Satyajit Ray came to be regarded as one of the world's finest film-makers ever. Today, more than a decade after his death, he continues to be India's most respected name in international film circles. Apart from his achievements as a director, Ray was also a prolific writer of novels, short stories, and essays on cinema. Speaking of Films brings together some of Ray's most memorable writings on film and film-making. With the masterly precision and clarity that characterize his films, Ray discusses a wide array of subjects: the structure and language of cinema with special reference to his adaptations of Tagore and Bibhuti Bhushan Bandopadhyay, the appropriate use of background music and dialogue in films, the relationship between a film-maker and a film critic, and important develoents in cinema like the advent of sound and colour. He also writes about his own experiences, the challenges of working with rank amateurs, and the innovations called for when making a film in the face of technological, financial and logistical constraints. In the process, Ray provides fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpses of the people who worked with him""the intricacies of getting Chhabi Biswas, who had no ear for music, to play a patron of classical music in Jalsaghar; the incredible memory of the seventy-five-year-old Chunibala Devi, Indir Thakrun of Pather Panchali, and her remarkable attention to details. This first-ever translation of Bishay Chalachitra, a seminal collection of essays on cinema, Speaking of Films retains the lucidity and simplicity that is a hallmark of Ray's writing, and gives an invaluable insight into the mind of a genius.",Speaking Of Films,Satyajit Ray, , ,Penguin group,9780144000265,"1st Published,2005",220,India,English

But when he accidentally kills a clansman, things begin to fall apart. Then Okonkwo returns from exile to find missionaries and colonial governors have arrived in the village. With his world thrown radically off-balance he can only hurtle towards tragedy. A classic in every sense, Chinua Achebe's stark, coolly ironic novel reshaped both Africa and world literature.
Introduction
Sometime in 1957, an advertisement appeared in the Spectator. The advertiser promised that, for a fee, ‘Authors’ Manuscripts [would be] Typed’. Several thousand miles away in Lagos, the bustling, seaside capital city of the soon-to-be independent British West African colony of Nigeria, an aspiring writer who happened to require the services of a typist came across the advertisement and promptly sent off his manuscript to England. The manuscript, named from a poem by the Irish poet W. B. Yeats, was entitled Things Fall Apart. Its author, the twenty-seven-year-old Chinua Achebe, was a producer with the Nigerian Broadcasting Service. For two years he had occupied his nights and his every free moment with the task of writing, and rigorously editing, the manuscript. It was a staggeringly ambitious work of invocation that was at once a celebration and an interrogation of the mores and culture of the South-eastern Igbo peoples, from whom Achebe descended, and an eloquent rebuttal of the all too casual denigration of Africans by, among others, European writers such as Joseph Conrad (whose quip, about the Congo setting of Heart of Darkness, that he was merely poking around in 'the dead cats of civilization’ has come to define Africa in the western imagination). 
For several months after posting his handwritten manuscript for typing, Achebe heard nothing from England. His polite but firm letters to the London address elicited no response. He was close to despair, convinced that it was lost. And it almost was lost but for the intervention of a friend, a British colleague at the Nigerian Broadcasting Service, who during her annual holiday in England took the time to track down the firm of typists. She returned to Nigeria with a typed copy of the manuscript. A year later, in 1958, William Heinemann published Things Fall Apart, the first title in what became the African Writers Series. The book received instant acclaim. It has since sold over ten million copies and has been translated into forty-five languages.
Chinua Achebe was born on I6 November 1930, in Ogidi, Eastern Nigeria. His great uncle, who brought up Achebe's father, had taken the highest-but-one title' in the clan, and was considered to be of such importance that when in the late nineteenth century Anglican missionaries came to Ogidi, and sought support for their work, they were shown to his compound. ‘For a short while he allowed them to operate from his compound,’ Achebe says in an essay written nearly a century later, ‘but after a few days he sent them packing again.’ Not because he found their theology offensive, but because he found their music alarming. ‘Your music is too sad to come from a man’s house,’ Achebe's great uncle told the missionaries, ‘my neighbours might think it was my funeral dirge.’ Achebe's father on the other hand had no such reservations about the new creed. He joined the missionaries, received an education from them, and became, in 1904, a teacher and catechist for the Anglican Church. Achebe grew up in a home where they sang hymns and read the Bible night and day. But he would often sneak across to his ‘heathen’ uncle's compound and partake in pagan festival’s of rice and stew. To his delight, he found in the food no flavour of idolatry. The converts to the new creed looked down on the non-Christians in the village, calling them 'the people of nothing.’ But Achebe did not suffer from an identity crisis over the two cultures contesting for his devotion. He lived at the crossroads of culture and although, as he grew up, he knew to reject, 'all that rubbish [about] the evil forces and irrational passions prowling through Africa's heart of darkness', he felt also that the crossroads did have a certain dangerous potency, ‘because a man might perish there wrestling with multiple-headed spirits, but also he might be lucky and return to his people with the boon of prophetic vision’. 
In 1953, at the age of twenty-three Achebe took a degree in English from the prestigious University College, Ibadan, becoming by definition a member of the select élite of educated West Africans who came into adulthood in the 1950s, and who were destined by history to inherit from the colonial powers the task of running the independent nation-states that came into being during the post-Second World War implosion of the empire 'where the sun never sets'. It was a highly educated generation, high achieving and boundless in its aspirations. Its confidence was an embodiment of the all-encompassing spirit of optimism that swept across Africa from desert to coast as emancipation approached. In the wake of the 'Hitler War’, Britain and France had found the task of rebuilding themselves impossible to reconcile with the bedevilled logistics of running empires of continually hostile and endlessly subversive subjects who clamoured for and were in many instances willing to die for — independence.
But the new dawn into which Achebe's generation woke was brief, a conjurer's trick. Even as independence approached, the African states which Winston Churchill had characterized as being nothing but ‘a mere geographical expression' were still afflicted with the debilitating psychosis of their nineteenth-century birth at the Berlin conference hosted by Bismarck. Here they were arbitrarily conjured into existence by an alliance of expansionist European powers who had come together to stake their claims to the treasure trove known as Africa, which they considered theirs to share, and to negotiate the ground rules for sharing it. They had gathered to partition 'the Dark Continent'. Thus began the so-called 'scramble for Africa', the age of empire. In partitioning Africa, they replaced the cartographer’s terra incognita with a map in which ancient foes were Balkanized and forced to live cheek-by-jowl, and whole nations were atomized and divided into states defined no longer by their shared culture, their common heritage, but by the European flags which now held sway over them. Bismarck's conference invented the topography of simmering hatred that would be later utilized by his African clones, that perennial infestation of little tyrants and tin-pot megalomaniacs spread all over Africa propagating internecine bloodbaths whose purpose is, and always has been, not only to unearth and annihilate all manifestations of dissent, but to divide and plunder.
Even as Kwame Nkrumah in the Gold Coast, Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya, Mrs Funmilayo Ransome Kuti in Nigeria and many others all over the continent dared to stare the…",Things Fall Apart (50th Anniversary Edition) (Award-Winning Authors' Books),Chinua Achebe, , ,Penguin group,9780141186887,"1st Edition,1994",200,Abroad,English

Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw aims at amusing the readers by describing Greg Heffley and his problems in life. The book traces his dislike for his father’s impositions, his disdain for Rodrick and the reluctance towards his mother’s demands of studying more.

The book covers the events in Greg’s life during the later half of seventh grade. It contains hilarious situations that Greg has to deal with such as the doing the laundry using laundry hoop gifted by Uncle Charlie. Greg is mortified when his father, impressed by a transformed nasty teenager, Lenwood Heath, who turned decent after attending a military school, decides to send Greg as well. Greg tries hard to distract his father from such terrifying prospects by talking incessantly about soccer and boy scouts. The book shows how an embarrassing incident leads to his father being grateful to him and allowing him to continue his studies in school.

The author expertly details Greg’s subtle and amusing encounters with his family and the lengths to which he goes to get out of troublesome situations.

The Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw is a popular comedy novel in the children’s books category. The book, along with the next one in the series, has been adapted into a film.

Winston Smith, the protagonist of Nineteen Eighty-Four, is a member of the ruling party in the fictional town of Oceania in London. The Party’s leader is Big Brother, who monitors the private and public lives of the people. Posters of ""Big Brother Is Watching You"" dominate Oceania. Each and every action of the people including Winston, are closely monitored. The novel explores totalitarianism and Orwell’s opposition to it.

Winston Smith works in the Ministry of Truth and edits articles for the Party. The Party dominates the entire nation, including areas like language and history. The Party also forces the implementation of a new language called ‘Newspeak’. Its main aim is to prevent political rebellion through elimination of all the words related to it. The Thought Police of the Party restrict any thoughts which are against its Party and any thoughts against the State are regarded as Thoughtcrime.

As the novel progresses, Winston is deeply frustrated by the many rules and rigid oppression of the Party. Winston soon begins to detest the Party which prohibits sex, free thought, or individuality. He purchases a diary illegally and begins to record his criminal thoughts. He also begins an affair with the beautiful and dark-haired Julia. The criminal activities of Winston bring him to the opposition party’s notice. Winston also comes across the mysterious O’Brien. Winston thinks O’Brien is a secret member of the legendary group called the Brotherhood which aims to overthrow the ruling Party.

Will Winston ever be able to escape from Big Brother? How can one reason and think in a nation where everything is fabricated? Who is O'Brien and what does he want from Winston?

Published in 1949, Nineteen Eighty-Four is among Orwell’s best loved works. The novel exerts much influence among its readers and continues to be highly popular even to this day. It has been adapted to the television, radio, film, and theatre formats.

India 2020 is about to become a reality. Are we ready? In 1998, Dr Kalam and Y.S. Rajan published the now iconic India 2020, a vision document for the new millennium that charted how India could become one of the top five economic powers in the world by 2020. Sixteen years later, as the year 2020 approaches, it is time to take stock of how much India has achieved and what lies ahead. 

In many ways, India s growth story in the twenty-first century has been hamstrung by missed opportunities and slowdowns in project execution; but it has also been marked by new opportunities and emerging technologies that make faster and more inclusive growth viable. A renewed policy focus is now needed for agriculture, manufacturing, mining, the chemicals industry, health care and infrastructure to invigorate these sectors and boost economic growth, argue Kalam and Rajan. Alongside, education, job creation, emerging technologies, biodiversity, waste management, national security and the knowledge economy are some of the other vital areas that we need to build on as we look beyond 2020. 

India can still make it to the list of developed nations in a decade. Beyond 2020 provides an action plan for that transformation. (goodreads.com)",Beyond 2020 : A Vision for Tomorrows India,A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, , ,Penguin group,9780143426066,"1st Published,2014",281,India,English

Noam Chomsky is best placed to speak about geopolitics. His experience and voice carry weight and resonate throughout the halls of the government. This collection brings readers some of his speeches and interviews, speaking about myriad topics such as US Foreign Policy, the new global economy, food and Third World economic miracles. He delves into the roots of fascism, and explores the US, the CIA and the government’s clandestine activities. His views on religious fundamentalism, global inequality and the foundation of racism form an interesting read for all, for not only does he touch upon these topics, but also on the ecological catastrophe that is approaching us all, and the myth of the Third World debt.

In The Politics Aristotle addresses the questions that lie at the heart of political science. How should society be ordered to ensure the happiness of the individual? Which forms of government are best and how should they be maintained? By analysing a range of city constitutions - oligarchies, democracies and tyrannies - he seeks to establish the strengths and weaknesses of each system, and to decide which are the most effective, in theory and in practice. A hugely significant work, which has influenced thinkers as diverse as Thomas Aquinas and Machiavelli, The Politics remains an outstanding commentary on fundamental political issues and concerns, and provides fascinating insights into the workings and attitudes of the Greek city-state.
The introductions by T. A. Sinclair and Trevor J. Saunders discuss the influence of The Politics on philosophers, its modern relevance and Aristotle's political beliefs.

Mohan Kumar discovered the pleasures of sex when he was studying in the US. While he is at Princeton University, he loses his virginity to a lovely black woman, Jessica Brown. They continue their relationship for some time. While still in the US, Mohan Kumar also has a relationship with an older woman, Yasmeen, a Pakistani. Having learnt more about lust than probably anything else, he returns to India, to where his father lives. He then gets married.

Mohan Kumar still continues to indulge his lustful passions. When his wife gives birth to a son, it opens up new opportunities for him. One of the nurses hired to take care of the child, Mary Joseph, becomes another of his willing partners.

His wife Sonu is neurotic, and her disposition is not improved by her husband’s constant affairs. Finally, they separate and get a divorce. Mohan’s ruling passion is still sex. He has numerous relationships with many different women, starting with the maid Dhanno. A successful and wealthy businessman now, Mohan starts advertising for the company of women. He has a succeeding line of companions, from an English Professor to a sensual Sri Lankan woman named Susanthika.

In between all this, he has twinges of conscience that try to awaken him to a sense of responsibility, to take a look at where he is going. He also has the occasional need to find spiritual solace by visiting Haridwar, and seeing the Ganga Aarti. The sight of the holy river comforts him, but he still keeps returning to his preferred mode of life.

The Company Of Women deals with love, lust and passion, and obsessive indulgence. Mohan Kumar, despite his faults, has some redeeming moments, like the affection and respect he shows for his father, and the occasional spiritual journeys he has. However, none of these help him rein in his lust.

In Chariots Of The Gods, Erich Von Daniken puts forth the hypothesis than many of the religious and technological events of early human civilization were directly influenced by ancient astronauts or aliens who visited the earth.


Moreover, Daniken claims we are the descendants of these ancient beings. He even cites several archaeological discoveries to prove his claim. Some of these discoveries include a huge spaceport in the Andes, computer astronomy from Egyptian and Incan ruins, and spaceflight navigation charts that are a thousand years old.


Daniken highlights the fact that several complex structures existed well before the technological progress to manufacture them had been accomplished. Some of these structures include the Stonehenge, the Nazca lines in Peru, and the pyramids of Egypt. Daniken claims that the existence of such artifacts can only be explained by the presence of a strong extraterrestrial influence.


He also explains that the traditions of most religions contain references to extraterrestrial presence. However, such references have not withstood the test of time, and have been misinterpreted and obscured by the passage of generations.


The book is backed by the author’s research into lost cities, ancient ruins, and numerous scientific facts. Some of the information presented in the book was later refuted by the author himself, when fresh evidence came to light.


Chariots Of The Gods was first published in 1968. A German documentary based on the book was released in 1970. It was directed by Harald Reinl. It even went on to earn an Oscar nomination. Paradox Entertainment held the rights to the movie adaptation of the book as of March 2009. A theme park based on the book is also in the works. The book was originally written in German. It has been translated into 32 languages since then.

The Fabric Of The Cosmos: Space, Time And The Texture Of Reality is a popular science book that tackles the big questions. It directly asks and attempts to answer questions such as what is reality and whether existence is possible without space and time, can we travel to the past, and what the limits of the universe are. The book from start to finish is an exploration of all that human beings have understood about the makeup of the universe. It is a journey which begins with Classical Physics and ends in the mysterious ten-dimensional M-Theory.

Brian Greene, in this book, has sought to make the non-intuitive, and sometimes counter-intuitive, mathematical concepts and theories accessible to the general audience, and the non-specialists. Concepts and ideas such as String Theory, Inflationary Cosmology, and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle are explained by drawing analogies to common experiences. Undertaking such a task, daunting as it is, stems from Brian’s passion for science and an ability to convert abstract scientific and mathematical ideas into poetic images.

Brian Greene also discusses teleportation, albeit in a more philosophical platform. He then explains in much greater depth the paradoxes of time travel. Additionally, he introduces his readers to his vision of life in a three-brane universe. Towards the end of the book, Greene surveys likely discoveries of the coming decades. The Fabric Of The Cosmos: Space, Time And The Texture Of Reality garnered extensive praise from newspapers and magazines. While Sunday Times recommended it as a must-read, the reviews of the book in Guardian and The New York Times were positive. The book spent half a year on The New York Times Bestseller list.

Marked by a deep personal touch and a classic blend of quick witted humour and detailed analysis of the author’s personal experiences in his personal and professional journey, Truth, Love and A Little Malice may be described as a controversial yet bold attempt by the writer to unabashedly bring to light his personal life experiences.

The book has Singh tracing his familial roots and talking about his family legacy. The book opens up and outgrows into further detailed images of the author’s meetings with political dignitaries. As he openly discusses those meetings with his unique wit, the reader is bound to be surprised yet amazed by his approach.

Being exposed to many post independent events in India, and closely attached politically as a journalist and columnist, the author reveals the deepest secrets of Indian political history in a very different from what we know it as. An example would be when he talks about the welcoming of Maneka Gandhi, as a daughter-in-law into the Gandhi family.
Truth, Love and A Little Malice marks the eventful journey of a bold writer from outside and from within and also reveals details about his first ever relationship and the intimacy surrounding it. The author does not for a minute bother to care about himself or his image and projects himself as a man who has made mistakes in his life.

Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships helps provide the readers with insights into what goes on during most of their social interactions. Berne tells the readers about transactional analysis, which can be utilized for interpreting social interactions. He also examines three roles, which is that of a Parent, Child, and Adult. He explains that a vast majority of behavioral issues stem from confusion of these roles. Berne makes use of an example to illustrate his proposition, which is an office setting where a parent-like boss begins to exercise his authority on his employees. This often results in rebellion, and child-like reactions from his employees.

He also explains that infants can slip into irreversible physical and mental decline due to lack of physical handling. Berne also goes on to throw light on certain studies that elucidate that temporary psychosis may occur due to sensory deprivation in adults. He explains that adults need to interact with individuals, as much as children need to, however, it may not always be possible to do so. This causes an individual to seek emotional strokes from others, which Berne describes as the fundamental unit of social action. He then uses this illustration to explain that exchanging strokes is a transaction, hence the term, Transactional Analysis.

Berne begins to tackle the issue of games played by individuals. He examines one of the most common statements people make, especially married couples, which is ‘If it weren’t for you’. He says that one partner often complains that the other often poses a roadblock in their attempts to do something they want. However, Berne throws light on the fact that individuals actually make such statements to throw the ball in someone else’s court, as a means of camouflaging their own weaknesses.

Quantum theory confronts us with strange paradoxes which refute the logic of conventional physics. At the subatomic level, one particle seems to know what the rest are doing, and according to Heisenberg’s ground-breaking “uncertainty principle”, there is a limit on how precisely nature can be observed by us. And yet, his theory is astoundingly accurate and extensively applied, explaining all of chemistry and most of physics. In this title, the puzzle of the wave-particle dual nature is discussed. Also described are the two questions raised against Bohr’s “Copenhagen Interpretation”, the famous “dead and alive cat”, and the EPR paradox, both of which remain uncertain yet.

The battle for Stalingrad became the focus of Hitler and Stalin's determination to win the gruesome, vicious war on the eastern front. The citizens of Stalingrad endured unimaginable hardship; the battle, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting in each room of each building, was brutally destructive to both armies. But the eventual victory of the Red Army, and the failure of Hitler's Operation Barbarossa, was the first defeat of Hitler's territorial ambitions in Europe, and the start of his decline.

An extraordinary story of tactical genius, civilian bravery, obsession, carnage and the nature of war itself, Stalingrad will act as a testament to the vital role of the soviet war effort.

Untouchable, published in 1935, deals with India’s caste system. Almost 80 years later, the problem still exists in contemporary India.

The story is about Bakha, the protagonist, who is a 18 year old sweeper and toilet cleaner. Bakha is a young and attractive man but is not accepted in the society because he belongs to the lowest of the lower class. His occupation of cleaning toilet makes him an outcast. He is often insulted by people, he is forced to beg for food, is not allowed to touch higher-class Hindus, cannot enter temples and must follows their orders. He tries to dress like Englishmen in hopes that this westernization would rid him of this burden of casteism, but his friends humiliate him for dressing like a sahib to try and be what he is not.

Untouchable describes a day of great difficulty for Bakha. He accidentally touches a upper-caste Hindu and gets slapped for having ‘polluted’ the man. Later on in the day, as he cleans a lady’s gutter, though she gives him food, she throws it on him. Unfortunately, Bakha sister gets molested by a priest on that very day. And Bakha gets blamed for injuring a young boy after a hockey match. As his day goes on, it gets from bad to worse. Finally, Untouchable tells us how Bakha’s father throws him out of the house. Bakha becomes frustrated and tries to find why he has to lead such a miserable and tragic life. He learns about Christianity and about the ways of Mahatma Gandhi. As the plot thickens, Barkha comes to an surprising conclusion.

Untouchable was inspired by the author’s own experiences. His aunt was treated as an outcast in his own family because she had food with a Muslim and later committed suicide. Anand himself had gotten injured after a hockey match and was carried home by a boy of the lower caste. Instead of thanking him, Anand’s mother had beaten up the boy. The book is written in lucid and simple language. This controversial piece of literature established the author as one of India’s leading English writers.

As a result, he wrote The Metaphysics which combined the rational and natural aspects of the universe.

Aristotle’s principal subject is “being understood as being”. His philosophy asserts that something can be asserted about a thing because it exists, and not because that thing has special traits.

The entire collection of texts, are centered around principal questions such as what it means to exist, what kinds of things exist in this world, and how can beings continue to exist when they undergo change in the world. The first six books in The Metaphysics deal with concepts such as the principal cause of things, how humans acquire wisdom, problems with philosophy, contradiction principles, definitions of key terms, and the hierarchy of sciences. Books 7, 8, and 9, examine concepts such as the essence of being, substance, and the nature of being a human being.

Aristotle also discusses at length, concepts such potentiality and actuality. Books 10 to 14, address the philosophy of Mathematics, unity, and provide further commentaries on the concept of god.

Aristotle’s The Metaphysics is considered to be one of the the greatest philosophical works. In Lawson-Tancred’s translation of The Metaphysics, readers will find an introductory essay that highlights the central themes of the philosophy of metaphysics.

This edition of The Metaphysics was published in 1998, by Penguin Classics.

About Aristotle

Aristotle was a Greek philosopher, and the founder of the metaphysical branch of philosophy.

He wrote several treatises during his lifetime. Some of these were Politics, Physics, The Art Of Rhetoric, The Nicomachean Ethics, and Poetics.

Aristotle was the Head at the Royal Academy in Macedon. He had many notable people under his tutelage such as Alexander, Cassander, and Ptolemy. Aristotle was interested in learning about all things natural. As a result, he wrote many treatises on topics such as astronomy, embryology, literature, and foreign customs. At one point in his life, Aristotle established his own school, known as Lyceum. He wrote on numerous topics like linguistics, music, physics, logic, biology, zoology, and on the government. Aristotle had been married twice, and had a son named Nicomachus. He died in 322 BC from natural causes. The Aristotle Mountains, a group of mountains in Graham Land, Antarctica were named in his honor.",Metaphysics,Aristotle, , ,Penguin group,9780140446197,1st Edition,528,Abroad,English

Merging the life of a writer with the city of his childhood is a truly natural and exciting proposition. This becomes all the more true for an author who has come to symbolize the liberal face of Turkey. Istanbul: Memories And The City by Orhan Pamuk is a shimmering evocation of a city that is both intimate and panoramic. Written with a sense of melancholy, the author describes his life and how the change in the city has affected and shaped the manner in which he perceives the city. A personal memoir, the book also talks about prominent authors and writers who are in some way linked to the city.

Istanbul: Memories And The City is a book that revolves around a serious toddler who lives his life among the complicated lives of his family members. The entire household is ruled by the author’s grandmother, who though old and bedridden, controls the entire family but continuously mourns the fact that her sons are wasting the wealth and fortune of the family. Besides this, the author’s childhood is dominated by his uncle and aunts’ fights, and his parents’ collapsing marriage.

Split between his inner and outer reality, the author creates an alter ego and draws the readers into his dark house crammed with formal yet comfortable furniture, unused pianos, showcases with photographs and jewelry. The unloved and decayed city of Istanbul during the sixties and eighties is aptly described in the book. Applying his prose and skill through the book, the author weaves an intricate story about a city with all its customs and traditions and also provides some self-reflection. All in all, Istanbul: Memories And The City is a stunning novel that begins as the autobiography of the author and eventually becomes the story of an amazing and beautiful city.

About Orhan Pamuk

A Turkish novelist, academician and screenwriter, Orhan Pamuk is also the proud recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, 2006.

A major characteristic that is evident in Pamuk’s entire writing style is a loss of identity and confusion, that is a result of the conflict between the values of the East and West. Often troubling and alarming, the books have complex plots and characters. His works are also based on an admiration for various creative arts like literature and painting.

Other books by the author include The White Castle, My Name is Red, Snow, The Black Book, The Museum of Innocence, and The Silent House.

After graduating from the Institute of Journalism at the University of Istanbul, Pamuk became a full time writer. In March 1982, he married Aylin Türegün and they had a daughter named Rüya in 1991. The couple, however, divorced in 2001. Pamuk is currently in a relationship with Kiran Desai, a prominent author. One of the most prominent storytellers of Turkey, his books have sold more than eleven million copies around the world, and have been translated into almost 60 languages.",Istanbul: Memories of a City (Nobel Prize Winner's),Orhan Pamuk, , ,Penguin group,9780571218332, , ,Abroad,English

There have been innumerable questions that have been raised while talking about merging science and philosophy. Does God exist? Is science somewhere responsible for shaping the faith in God? Our culture and deep rooted values have conditioned us to believe in God, but some still question his existence. So, can one reach a common road between science and spirituality?

With the increasing philosophical scepticism and developments in science, man appeared to lose faith in God. But science itself has proved to be a false god, leaving in its wake a disillusioned and despondent mankind.

The author explains his personal journey that begins in a small town in Bengal, which was rife with turbulent periods that involved a famine and the chaos of the freedom struggle. His life journey, deeply influenced by his father’s and later by Mahatma Gandhi and Satyendranath Bose, is dealt with in detail, with a touch of spirituality.

The discoverer and pioneer of laser technology, thereafter facilitating the LASIK technique, Bhaumik explains, in his book, the reasons behind taking up research in spirituality and then takes a spiritual yet scientific approach to explain the existence and the strong presence of God in the universe.

The book can be seen as one that is divided into three parts. The first part deals with Bhaumik’s personal life amidst the extremities of poverty. The second part deals with his journey into the deep world of science and research, which were a turning point in his life and transformed him from a commoner to a multi-millionnaire. The third and final part is the author’s personal journey as he moves deep into the world of spirituality and begins to question certain realities.

Inspirational and deeply enriching, Code Name God attempts to provide the reader with a simple yet scientific approach to believe in God and to prove his existence.

The Communist Manifesto, which was originally titled as Manifesto of the Communist Party, is an influential political manuscript that lays out the Communist League’s aims and program. The Manifesto presents an analytical insight into the class struggle of the historical and contemporary era. The book also highlights the problems of capitalism.

The Communist Manifesto is divided into 4 sections. The first part is Bourgeois and Proletarians. It focuses on the Communist theory of the history and relation between the Bourgeois and the Proletarians. The next section, Proletarians and Communists, attempts to understand the relationship between Proletarians and Communists. The third part discusses the Socialist and Communist Literature and their flaws. The final part discusses the position of the Communists and its relation to the other opposition parties.

This edition of The Communist Manifesto has been edited by Gareth Stedman Jones. In this edition, he discusses The Reception of the Manifesto, The Communist League, The Spectre of Communism, and Engel’s and Marx’s contributions. Gareth Stedman Jones also discusses the The Young Hegelians including Hegel and Hegelianism, the Emergence of the Young Hegelians, and the Battle over Christianity. It also discuses the Political Economy, Communism, The True Natural History of Man, The Impact of Stirner, and the transformation from Republicanism to Communism.
Written after 4 years of collaboration between Engel and Marx, The Communist Manifesto was originally written in German and published on 21 February 1848. When it was originally published, it raised much controversy. Today, it is an important manifesto, a powerful historical document, and an important classical work.

Over the next forty years, Satyajit Ray came to be regarded as one of the world's finest film-makers ever. Today, more than a decade after his death, he continues to be India's most respected name in international film circles. Apart from his achievements as a director, Ray was also a prolific writer of novels, short stories, and essays on cinema. Speaking of Films brings together some of Ray's most memorable writings on film and film-making. With the masterly precision and clarity that characterize his films, Ray discusses a wide array of subjects: the structure and language of cinema with special reference to his adaptations of Tagore and Bibhuti Bhushan Bandopadhyay, the appropriate use of background music and dialogue in films, the relationship between a film-maker and a film critic, and important develoents in cinema like the advent of sound and colour. He also writes about his own experiences, the challenges of working with rank amateurs, and the innovations called for when making a film in the face of technological, financial and logistical constraints. In the process, Ray provides fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpses of the people who worked with him""the intricacies of getting Chhabi Biswas, who had no ear for music, to play a patron of classical music in Jalsaghar; the incredible memory of the seventy-five-year-old Chunibala Devi, Indir Thakrun of Pather Panchali, and her remarkable attention to details.

Introduction
Sometime in 1957, an advertisement appeared in the Spectator. The advertiser promised that, for a fee, ‘Authors’ Manuscripts [would be] Typed’. Several thousand miles away in Lagos, the bustling, seaside capital city of the soon-to-be independent British West African colony of Nigeria, an aspiring writer who happened to require the services of a typist came across the advertisement and promptly sent off his manuscript to England. The manuscript, named from a poem by the Irish poet W. B. Yeats, was entitled Things Fall Apart. Its author, the twenty-seven-year-old Chinua Achebe, was a producer with the Nigerian Broadcasting Service. For two years he had occupied his nights and his every free moment with the task of writing, and rigorously editing, the manuscript. It was a staggeringly ambitious work of invocation that was at once a celebration and an interrogation of the mores and culture of the South-eastern Igbo peoples, from whom Achebe descended, and an eloquent rebuttal of the all too casual denigration of Africans by, among others, European writers such as Joseph Conrad (whose quip, about the Congo setting of Heart of Darkness, that he was merely poking around in 'the dead cats of civilization’ has come to define Africa in the western imagination). 
For several months after posting his handwritten manuscript for typing, Achebe heard nothing from England. His polite but firm letters to the London address elicited no response. He was close to despair, convinced that it was lost. And it almost was lost but for the intervention of a friend, a British colleague at the Nigerian Broadcasting Service, who during her annual holiday in England took the time to track down the firm of typists. She returned to Nigeria with a typed copy of the manuscript. A year later, in 1958, William Heinemann published Things Fall Apart, the first title in what became the African Writers Series. The book received instant acclaim. It has since sold over ten million copies and has been translated into forty-five languages.
Chinua Achebe was born on I6 November 1930, in Ogidi, Eastern Nigeria. His great uncle, who brought up Achebe's father, had taken the highest-but-one title' in the clan, and was considered to be of such importance that when in the late nineteenth century Anglican missionaries came to Ogidi, and sought support for their work, they were shown to his compound. ‘For a short while he allowed them to operate from his compound,’ Achebe says in an essay written nearly a century later, ‘but after a few days he sent them packing again.’ Not because he found their theology offensive, but because he found their music alarming. ‘Your music is too sad to come from a man’s house,’ Achebe's great uncle told the missionaries, ‘my neighbours might think it was my funeral dirge.’ Achebe's father on the other hand had no such reservations about the new creed. He joined the missionaries, received an education from them, and became, in 1904, a teacher and catechist for the Anglican Church. Achebe grew up in a home where they sang hymns and read the Bible night and day. But he would often sneak across to his ‘heathen’ uncle's compound and partake in pagan festival’s of rice and stew. To his delight, he found in the food no flavour of idolatry. The converts to the new creed looked down on the non-Christians in the village, calling them 'the people of nothing.’ But Achebe did not suffer from an identity crisis over the two cultures contesting for his devotion. He lived at the crossroads of culture and although, as he grew up, he knew to reject, 'all that rubbish [about] the evil forces and irrational passions prowling through Africa's heart of darkness', he felt also that the crossroads did have a certain dangerous potency, ‘because a man might perish there wrestling with multiple-headed spirits, but also he might be lucky and return to his people with the boon of prophetic vision’. 
In 1953, at the age of twenty-three Achebe took a degree in English from the prestigious University College, Ibadan, becoming by definition a member of the select élite of educated West Africans who came into adulthood in the 1950s, and who were destined by history to inherit from the colonial powers the task of running the independent nation-states that came into being during the post-Second World War implosion of the empire 'where the sun never sets'. It was a highly educated generation, high achieving and boundless in its aspirations. Its confidence was an embodiment of the all-encompassing spirit of optimism that swept across Africa from desert to coast as emancipation approached. In the wake of the 'Hitler War’, Britain and France had found the task of rebuilding themselves impossible to reconcile with the bedevilled logistics of running empires of continually hostile and endlessly subversive subjects who clamoured for and were in many instances willing to die for — independence.
But the new dawn into which Achebe's generation woke was brief, a conjurer's trick. Even as independence approached, the African states which Winston Churchill had characterized as being nothing but ‘a mere geographical expression' were still afflicted with the debilitating psychosis of their nineteenth-century birth at the Berlin conference hosted by Bismarck. Here they were arbitrarily conjured into existence by an alliance of expansionist European powers who had come together to stake their claims to the treasure trove known as Africa, which they considered theirs to share, and to negotiate the ground rules for sharing it. They had gathered to partition 'the Dark Continent'. Thus began the so-called 'scramble for Africa', the age of empire. In partitioning Africa, they replaced the cartographer’s terra incognita with a map in which ancient foes were Balkanized and forced to live cheek-by-jowl, and whole nations were atomized and divided into states defined no longer by their shared culture, their common heritage, but by the European flags which now held sway over them. Bismarck's conference invented the topography of simmering hatred that would be later utilized by his African clones, that perennial infestation of little tyrants and tin-pot megalomaniacs spread all over Africa propagating internecine bloodbaths whose purpose is, and always has been, not only to unearth and annihilate all manifestations of dissent, but to divide and plunder.

The book shows how an embarrassing incident leads to his father being grateful to him and allowing him to continue his studies in school.

The author expertly details Greg’s subtle and amusing encounters with his family and the lengths to which he goes to get out of troublesome situations.

The Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw is a popular comedy novel in the children’s books category. The book, along with the next one in the series, has been adapted into a film.

Winston Smith, the protagonist of Nineteen Eighty-Four, is a member of the ruling party in the fictional town of Oceania in London. The Party’s leader is Big Brother, who monitors the private and public lives of the people. Posters of ""Big Brother Is Watching You"" dominate Oceania. Each and every action of the people including Winston, are closely monitored. The novel explores totalitarianism and Orwell’s opposition to it.

Winston Smith works in the Ministry of Truth and edits articles for the Party. The Party dominates the entire nation, including areas like language and history. The Party also forces the implementation of a new language called ‘Newspeak’. Its main aim is to prevent political rebellion through elimination of all the words related to it. The Thought Police of the Party restrict any thoughts which are against its Party and any thoughts against the State are regarded as Thoughtcrime.

As the novel progresses, Winston is deeply frustrated by the many rules and rigid oppression of the Party. Winston soon begins to detest the Party which prohibits sex, free thought, or individuality. He purchases a diary illegally and begins to record his criminal thoughts. He also begins an affair with the beautiful and dark-haired Julia. The criminal activities of Winston bring him to the opposition party’s notice. Winston also comes across the mysterious O’Brien. Winston thinks O’Brien is a secret member of the legendary group called the Brotherhood which aims to overthrow the ruling Party.

Will Winston ever be able to escape from Big Brother? How can one reason and think in a nation where everything is fabricated? Who is O'Brien and what does he want from Winston?

Published in 1949, Nineteen Eighty-Four is among Orwell’s best loved works. The novel exerts much influence among its readers and continues to be highly popular even to this day. It has been adapted to the television, radio, film, and theatre formats.

India 2020 is about to become a reality. Are we ready? In 1998, Dr Kalam and Y.S. Rajan published the now iconic India 2020, a vision document for the new millennium that charted how India could become one of the top five economic powers in the world by 2020. Sixteen years later, as the year 2020 approaches, it is time to take stock of how much India has achieved and what lies ahead. 

In many ways, India s growth story in the twenty-first century has been hamstrung by missed opportunities and slowdowns in project execution; but it has also been marked by new opportunities and emerging technologies that make faster and more inclusive growth viable. A renewed policy focus is now needed for agriculture, manufacturing, mining, the chemicals industry, health care and infrastructure to invigorate these sectors and boost economic growth, argue Kalam and Rajan. Alongside, education, job creation, emerging technologies, biodiversity, waste management, national security and the knowledge economy are some of the other vital areas that we need to build on as we look beyond 2020. 

India can still make it to the list of developed nations in a decade. Beyond 2020 provides an action plan for that transformation. (goodreads.com)",Beyond 2020 : A Vision for Tomorrows India,A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, , ,Penguin group,9780143426066,"1st Published,2014",281,India,English

Noam Chomsky is best placed to speak about geopolitics. His experience and voice carry weight and resonate throughout the halls of the government. This collection brings readers some of his speeches and interviews, speaking about myriad topics such as US Foreign Policy, the new global economy, food and Third World economic miracles. He delves into the roots of fascism, and explores the US, the CIA and the government’s clandestine activities. His views on religious fundamentalism, global inequality and the foundation of racism form an interesting read for all, for not only does he touch upon these topics, but also on the ecological catastrophe that is approaching us all, and the myth of the Third World debt.

In The Politics Aristotle addresses the questions that lie at the heart of political science. How should society be ordered to ensure the happiness of the individual? Which forms of government are best and how should they be maintained? By analysing a range of city constitutions - oligarchies, democracies and tyrannies - he seeks to establish the strengths and weaknesses of each system, and to decide which are the most effective, in theory and in practice. A hugely significant work, which has influenced thinkers as diverse as Thomas Aquinas and Machiavelli, The Politics remains an outstanding commentary on fundamental political issues and concerns, and provides fascinating insights into the workings and attitudes of the Greek city-state.

Mohan Kumar discovered the pleasures of sex when he was studying in the US. While he is at Princeton University, he loses his virginity to a lovely black woman, Jessica Brown. They continue their relationship for some time. While still in the US, Mohan Kumar also has a relationship with an older woman, Yasmeen, a Pakistani. Having learnt more about lust than probably anything else, he returns to India, to where his father lives. He then gets married.

Mohan Kumar still continues to indulge his lustful passions. When his wife gives birth to a son, it opens up new opportunities for him. One of the nurses hired to take care of the child, Mary Joseph, becomes another of his willing partners.

His wife Sonu is neurotic, and her disposition is not improved by her husband’s constant affairs. Finally, they separate and get a divorce. Mohan’s ruling passion is still sex. He has numerous relationships with many different women, starting with the maid Dhanno. A successful and wealthy businessman now, Mohan starts advertising for the company of women. He has a succeeding line of companions, from an English Professor to a sensual Sri Lankan woman named Susanthika.

In between all this, he has twinges of conscience that try to awaken him to a sense of responsibility, to take a look at where he is going. He also has the occasional need to find spiritual solace by visiting Haridwar, and seeing the Ganga Aarti. The sight of the holy river comforts him, but he still keeps returning to his preferred mode of life.

The Company Of Women deals with love, lust and passion, and obsessive indulgence. Mohan Kumar, despite his faults, has some redeeming moments, like the affection and respect he shows for his father, and the occasional spiritual journeys he has. However, none of these help him rein in his lust.

In Chariots Of The Gods, Erich Von Daniken puts forth the hypothesis than many of the religious and technological events of early human civilization were directly influenced by ancient astronauts or aliens who visited the earth.


Moreover, Daniken claims we are the descendants of these ancient beings. He even cites several archaeological discoveries to prove his claim. Some of these discoveries include a huge spaceport in the Andes, computer astronomy from Egyptian and Incan ruins, and spaceflight navigation charts that are a thousand years old.


Daniken highlights the fact that several complex structures existed well before the technological progress to manufacture them had been accomplished. Some of these structures include the Stonehenge, the Nazca lines in Peru, and the pyramids of Egypt. Daniken claims that the existence of such artifacts can only be explained by the presence of a strong extraterrestrial influence.


He also explains that the traditions of most religions contain references to extraterrestrial presence. However, such references have not withstood the test of time, and have been misinterpreted and obscured by the passage of generations.


The book is backed by the author’s research into lost cities, ancient ruins, and numerous scientific facts. Some of the information presented in the book was later refuted by the author himself, when fresh evidence came to light.


Chariots Of The Gods was first published in 1968. A German documentary based on the book was released in 1970. It was directed by Harald Reinl. It even went on to earn an Oscar nomination. Paradox Entertainment held the rights to the movie adaptation of the book as of March 2009. A theme park based on the book is also in the works. The book was originally written in German. It has been translated into 32 languages since then.

The Fabric Of The Cosmos: Space, Time And The Texture Of Reality is a popular science book that tackles the big questions. It directly asks and attempts to answer questions such as what is reality and whether existence is possible without space and time, can we travel to the past, and what the limits of the universe are. The book from start to finish is an exploration of all that human beings have understood about the makeup of the universe. It is a journey which begins with Classical Physics and ends in the mysterious ten-dimensional M-Theory.

Brian Greene, in this book, has sought to make the non-intuitive, and sometimes counter-intuitive, mathematical concepts and theories accessible to the general audience, and the non-specialists. Concepts and ideas such as String Theory, Inflationary Cosmology, and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle are explained by drawing analogies to common experiences. Undertaking such a task, daunting as it is, stems from Brian’s passion for science and an ability to convert abstract scientific and mathematical ideas into poetic images.

Brian Greene also discusses teleportation, albeit in a more philosophical platform. He then explains in much greater depth the paradoxes of time travel. Additionally, he introduces his readers to his vision of life in a three-brane universe. Towards the end of the book, Greene surveys likely discoveries of the coming decades. The Fabric Of The Cosmos: Space, Time And The Texture Of Reality garnered extensive praise from newspapers and magazines. While Sunday Times recommended it as a must-read, the reviews of the book in Guardian and The New York Times were positive. The book spent half a year on The New York Times Bestseller list.

Marked by a deep personal touch and a classic blend of quick witted humour and detailed analysis of the author’s personal experiences in his personal and professional journey, Truth, Love and A Little Malice may be described as a controversial yet bold attempt by the writer to unabashedly bring to light his personal life experiences.

The book has Singh tracing his familial roots and talking about his family legacy. The book opens up and outgrows into further detailed images of the author’s meetings with political dignitaries. As he openly discusses those meetings with his unique wit, the reader is bound to be surprised yet amazed by his approach.

Being exposed to many post independent events in India, and closely attached politically as a journalist and columnist, the author reveals the deepest secrets of Indian political history in a very different from what we know it as. An example would be when he talks about the welcoming of Maneka Gandhi, as a daughter-in-law into the Gandhi family.
Truth, Love and A Little Malice marks the eventful journey of a bold writer from outside and from within and also reveals details about his first ever relationship and the intimacy surrounding it. The author does not for a minute bother to care about himself or his image and projects himself as a man who has made mistakes in his life.

Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships helps provide the readers with insights into what goes on during most of their social interactions. Berne tells the readers about transactional analysis, which can be utilized for interpreting social interactions. He also examines three roles, which is that of a Parent, Child, and Adult. He explains that a vast majority of behavioral issues stem from confusion of these roles. Berne makes use of an example to illustrate his proposition, which is an office setting where a parent-like boss begins to exercise his authority on his employees. This often results in rebellion, and child-like reactions from his employees.

He also explains that infants can slip into irreversible physical and mental decline due to lack of physical handling. Berne also goes on to throw light on certain studies that elucidate that temporary psychosis may occur due to sensory deprivation in adults. He explains that adults need to interact with individuals, as much as children need to, however, it may not always be possible to do so. This causes an individual to seek emotional strokes from others, which Berne describes as the fundamental unit of social action. He then uses this illustration to explain that exchanging strokes is a transaction, hence the term, Transactional Analysis.

Berne begins to tackle the issue of games played by individuals. He examines one of the most common statements people make, especially married couples, which is ‘If it weren’t for you’. He says that one partner often complains that the other often poses a roadblock in their attempts to do something they want. However, Berne throws light on the fact that individuals actually make such statements to throw the ball in someone else’s court, as a means of camouflaging their own weaknesses.

Quantum theory confronts us with strange paradoxes which refute the logic of conventional physics. At the subatomic level, one particle seems to know what the rest are doing, and according to Heisenberg’s ground-breaking “uncertainty principle”, there is a limit on how precisely nature can be observed by us. And yet, his theory is astoundingly accurate and extensively applied, explaining all of chemistry and most of physics. In this title, the puzzle of the wave-particle dual nature is discussed. Also described are the two questions raised against Bohr’s “Copenhagen Interpretation”, the famous “dead and alive cat”, and the EPR paradox, both of which remain uncertain yet.

The battle for Stalingrad became the focus of Hitler and Stalin's determination to win the gruesome, vicious war on the eastern front. The citizens of Stalingrad endured unimaginable hardship; the battle, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting in each room of each building, was brutally destructive to both armies. But the eventual victory of the Red Army, and the failure of Hitler's Operation Barbarossa, was the first defeat of Hitler's territorial ambitions in Europe, and the start of his decline.

An extraordinary story of tactical genius, civilian bravery, obsession, carnage and the nature of war itself, Stalingrad will act as a testament to the vital role of the soviet war effort.

Untouchable, published in 1935, deals with India’s caste system. Almost 80 years later, the problem still exists in contemporary India.

The story is about Bakha, the protagonist, who is a 18 year old sweeper and toilet cleaner. Bakha is a young and attractive man but is not accepted in the society because he belongs to the lowest of the lower class. His occupation of cleaning toilet makes him an outcast. He is often insulted by people, he is forced to beg for food, is not allowed to touch higher-class Hindus, cannot enter temples and must follows their orders. He tries to dress like Englishmen in hopes that this westernization would rid him of this burden of casteism, but his friends humiliate him for dressing like a sahib to try and be what he is not.

Untouchable describes a day of great difficulty for Bakha. He accidentally touches a upper-caste Hindu and gets slapped for having ‘polluted’ the man. Later on in the day, as he cleans a lady’s gutter, though she gives him food, she throws it on him. Unfortunately, Bakha sister gets molested by a priest on that very day. And Bakha gets blamed for injuring a young boy after a hockey match. As his day goes on, it gets from bad to worse. Finally, Untouchable tells us how Bakha’s father throws him out of the house. Bakha becomes frustrated and tries to find why he has to lead such a miserable and tragic life. He learns about Christianity and about the ways of Mahatma Gandhi. As the plot thickens, Barkha comes to an surprising conclusion.

Untouchable was inspired by the author’s own experiences. His aunt was treated as an outcast in his own family because she had food with a Muslim and later committed suicide. Anand himself had gotten injured after a hockey match and was carried home by a boy of the lower caste. Instead of thanking him, Anand’s mother had beaten up the boy. The book is written in lucid and simple language. This controversial piece of literature established the author as one of India’s leading English writers.

Aristotle’s The Metaphysics is a large philosophical collection of 14 books. Aristotle’s philosophy became the central branch for Western philosophical thought. Aristotle’s metaphysics grew out a reaction against Plato’s idealist doctrine. Aristotle was always concerned with natural phenomena. As a result, he wrote The Metaphysics which combined the rational and natural aspects of the universe.

Aristotle’s principal subject is “being understood as being”. His philosophy asserts that something can be asserted about a thing because it exists, and not because that thing has special traits.

The entire collection of texts, are centered around principal questions such as what it means to exist, what kinds of things exist in this world, and how can beings continue to exist when they undergo change in the world. The first six books in The Metaphysics deal with concepts such as the principal cause of things, how humans acquire wisdom, problems with philosophy, contradiction principles, definitions of key terms, and the hierarchy of sciences. Books 7, 8, and 9, examine concepts such as the essence of being, substance, and the nature of being a human being.

Aristotle also discusses at length, concepts such potentiality and actuality. Books 10 to 14, address the philosophy of Mathematics, unity, and provide further commentaries on the concept of god.

Aristotle’s The Metaphysics is considered to be one of the the greatest philosophical works. In Lawson-Tancred’s translation of The Metaphysics, readers will find an introductory essay that highlights the central themes of the philosophy of metaphysics.

This edition of The Metaphysics was published in 1998, by Penguin Classics.

About Aristotle

Aristotle was a Greek philosopher, and the founder of the metaphysical branch of philosophy.

He wrote several treatises during his lifetime. Some of these were Politics, Physics, The Art Of Rhetoric, The Nicomachean Ethics, and Poetics.

Aristotle was the Head at the Royal Academy in Macedon. He had many notable people under his tutelage such as Alexander, Cassander, and Ptolemy. Aristotle was interested in learning about all things natural. As a result, he wrote many treatises on topics such as astronomy, embryology, literature, and foreign customs. At one point in his life, Aristotle established his own school, known as Lyceum. He wrote on numerous topics like linguistics, music, physics, logic, biology, zoology, and on the government. Aristotle had been married twice, and had a son named Nicomachus. He died in 322 BC from natural causes. The Aristotle Mountains, a group of mountains in Graham Land, Antarctica were named in his honor.",Metaphysics,Aristotle, , ,Penguin group,9780140446197,1st Edition,528,Abroad,English

Merging the life of a writer with the city of his childhood is a truly natural and exciting proposition. This becomes all the more true for an author who has come to symbolize the liberal face of Turkey. Istanbul: Memories And The City by Orhan Pamuk is a shimmering evocation of a city that is both intimate and panoramic. Written with a sense of melancholy, the author describes his life and how the change in the city has affected and shaped the manner in which he perceives the city. A personal memoir, the book also talks about prominent authors and writers who are in some way linked to the city.

Istanbul: Memories And The City is a book that revolves around a serious toddler who lives his life among the complicated lives of his family members. The entire household is ruled by the author’s grandmother, who though old and bedridden, controls the entire family but continuously mourns the fact that her sons are wasting the wealth and fortune of the family. Besides this, the author’s childhood is dominated by his uncle and aunts’ fights, and his parents’ collapsing marriage.

Split between his inner and outer reality, the author creates an alter ego and draws the readers into his dark house crammed with formal yet comfortable furniture, unused pianos, showcases with photographs and jewelry. The unloved and decayed city of Istanbul during the sixties and eighties is aptly described in the book. Applying his prose and skill through the book, the author weaves an intricate story about a city with all its customs and traditions and also provides some self-reflection. All in all, Istanbul: Memories And The City is a stunning novel that begins as the autobiography of the author and eventually becomes the story of an amazing and beautiful city.

About Orhan Pamuk

A Turkish novelist, academician and screenwriter, Orhan Pamuk is also the proud recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, 2006.

A major characteristic that is evident in Pamuk’s entire writing style is a loss of identity and confusion, that is a result of the conflict between the values of the East and West. Often troubling and alarming, the books have complex plots and characters. His works are also based on an admiration for various creative arts like literature and painting.

Other books by the author include The White Castle, My Name is Red, Snow, The Black Book, The Museum of Innocence, and The Silent House.

After graduating from the Institute of Journalism at the University of Istanbul, Pamuk became a full time writer. In March 1982, he married Aylin Türegün and they had a daughter named Rüya in 1991. The couple, however, divorced in 2001. Pamuk is currently in a relationship with Kiran Desai, a prominent author. One of the most prominent storytellers of Turkey, his books have sold more than eleven million copies around the world, and have been translated into almost 60 languages.",Istanbul: Memories of a City (Nobel Prize Winner's),Orhan Pamuk, , ,Penguin group,9780571218332, , ,Abroad,English

There have been innumerable questions that have been raised while talking about merging science and philosophy. Does God exist? Is science somewhere responsible for shaping the faith in God? Our culture and deep rooted values have conditioned us to believe in God, but some still question his existence. So, can one reach a common road between science and spirituality?

With the increasing philosophical scepticism and developments in science, man appeared to lose faith in God. But science itself has proved to be a false god, leaving in its wake a disillusioned and despondent mankind.

The author explains his personal journey that begins in a small town in Bengal, which was rife with turbulent periods that involved a famine and the chaos of the freedom struggle. His life journey, deeply influenced by his father’s and later by Mahatma Gandhi and Satyendranath Bose, is dealt with in detail, with a touch of spirituality.

The discoverer and pioneer of laser technology, thereafter facilitating the LASIK technique, Bhaumik explains, in his book, the reasons behind taking up research in spirituality and then takes a spiritual yet scientific approach to explain the existence and the strong presence of God in the universe.

The book can be seen as one that is divided into three parts. The first part deals with Bhaumik’s personal life amidst the extremities of poverty. The second part deals with his journey into the deep world of science and research, which were a turning point in his life and transformed him from a commoner to a multi-millionnaire. The third and final part is the author’s personal journey as he moves deep into the world of spirituality and begins to question certain realities.

Inspirational and deeply enriching, Code Name God attempts to provide the reader with a simple yet scientific approach to believe in God and to prove his existence.

The Communist Manifesto, which was originally titled as Manifesto of the Communist Party, is an influential political manuscript that lays out the Communist League’s aims and program. The Manifesto presents an analytical insight into the class struggle of the historical and contemporary era. The book also highlights the problems of capitalism.

The Communist Manifesto is divided into 4 sections. The first part is Bourgeois and Proletarians. It focuses on the Communist theory of the history and relation between the Bourgeois and the Proletarians. The next section, Proletarians and Communists, attempts to understand the relationship between Proletarians and Communists. The third part discusses the Socialist and Communist Literature and their flaws. The final part discusses the position of the Communists and its relation to the other opposition parties.

This edition of The Communist Manifesto has been edited by Gareth Stedman Jones. In this edition, he discusses The Reception of the Manifesto, The Communist League, The Spectre of Communism, and Engel’s and Marx’s contributions. Gareth Stedman Jones also discusses the The Young Hegelians including Hegel and Hegelianism, the Emergence of the Young Hegelians, and the Battle over Christianity. It also discuses the Political Economy, Communism, The True Natural History of Man, The Impact of Stirner, and the transformation from Republicanism to Communism.
Written after 4 years of collaboration between Engel and Marx, The Communist Manifesto was originally written in German and published on 21 February 1848. When it was originally published, it raised much controversy. Today, it is an important manifesto, a powerful historical document, and an important classical work.

Over the next forty years, Satyajit Ray came to be regarded as one of the world's finest film-makers ever. Today, more than a decade after his death, he continues to be India's most respected name in international film circles. Apart from his achievements as a director, Ray was also a prolific writer of novels, short stories, and essays on cinema. Speaking of Films brings together some of Ray's most memorable writings on film and film-making. With the masterly precision and clarity that characterize his films, Ray discusses a wide array of subjects: the structure and language of cinema with special reference to his adaptations of Tagore and Bibhuti Bhushan Bandopadhyay, the appropriate use of background music and dialogue in films, the relationship between a film-maker and a film critic, and important develoents in cinema like the advent of sound and colour. He also writes about his own experiences, the challenges of working with rank amateurs, and the innovations called for when making a film in the face of technological, financial and logistical constraints. In the process, Ray provides fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpses of the people who worked with him""the intricacies of getting Chhabi Biswas, who had no ear for music, to play a patron of classical music in Jalsaghar; the incredible memory of the seventy-five-year-old Chunibala Devi, Indir Thakrun of Pather Panchali, and her remarkable attention to details. This first-ever translation of Bishay Chalachitra, a seminal collection of essays on cinema, Speaking of Films retains the lucidity and simplicity that is a hallmark of Ray's writing, and gives an invaluable insight into the mind of a genius.",Speaking Of Films,Satyajit Ray, , ,Penguin group,9780144000265,"1st Published,2005",220,India,English

But when he accidentally kills a clansman, things begin to fall apart. Then Okonkwo returns from exile to find missionaries and colonial governors have arrived in the village. With his world thrown radically off-balance he can only hurtle towards tragedy. A classic in every sense, Chinua Achebe's stark, coolly ironic novel reshaped both Africa and world literature.
Introduction
Sometime in 1957, an advertisement appeared in the Spectator. The advertiser promised that, for a fee, ‘Authors’ Manuscripts [would be] Typed’. Several thousand miles away in Lagos, the bustling, seaside capital city of the soon-to-be independent British West African colony of Nigeria, an aspiring writer who happened to require the services of a typist came across the advertisement and promptly sent off his manuscript to England. The manuscript, named from a poem by the Irish poet W. B. Yeats, was entitled Things Fall Apart. Its author, the twenty-seven-year-old Chinua Achebe, was a producer with the Nigerian Broadcasting Service. For two years he had occupied his nights and his every free moment with the task of writing, and rigorously editing, the manuscript. It was a staggeringly ambitious work of invocation that was at once a celebration and an interrogation of the mores and culture of the South-eastern Igbo peoples, from whom Achebe descended, and an eloquent rebuttal of the all too casual denigration of Africans by, among others, European writers such as Joseph Conrad (whose quip, about the Congo setting of Heart of Darkness, that he was merely poking around in 'the dead cats of civilization’ has come to define Africa in the western imagination). 
For several months after posting his handwritten manuscript for typing, Achebe heard nothing from England. His polite but firm letters to the London address elicited no response. He was close to despair, convinced that it was lost. And it almost was lost but for the intervention of a friend, a British colleague at the Nigerian Broadcasting Service, who during her annual holiday in England took the time to track down the firm of typists. She returned to Nigeria with a typed copy of the manuscript. A year later, in 1958, William Heinemann published Things Fall Apart, the first title in what became the African Writers Series. The book received instant acclaim. It has since sold over ten million copies and has been translated into forty-five languages.
Chinua Achebe was born on I6 November 1930, in Ogidi, Eastern Nigeria. His great uncle, who brought up Achebe's father, had taken the highest-but-one title' in the clan, and was considered to be of such importance that when in the late nineteenth century Anglican missionaries came to Ogidi, and sought support for their work, they were shown to his compound. ‘For a short while he allowed them to operate from his compound,’ Achebe says in an essay written nearly a century later, ‘but after a few days he sent them packing again.’ Not because he found their theology offensive, but because he found their music alarming. ‘Your music is too sad to come from a man’s house,’ Achebe's great uncle told the missionaries, ‘my neighbours might think it was my funeral dirge.’ Achebe's father on the other hand had no such reservations about the new creed. He joined the missionaries, received an education from them, and became, in 1904, a teacher and catechist for the Anglican Church. Achebe grew up in a home where they sang hymns and read the Bible night and day. But he would often sneak across to his ‘heathen’ uncle's compound and partake in pagan festival’s of rice and stew. To his delight, he found in the food no flavour of idolatry. The converts to the new creed looked down on the non-Christians in the village, calling them 'the people of nothing.’ But Achebe did not suffer from an identity crisis over the two cultures contesting for his devotion. He lived at the crossroads of culture and although, as he grew up, he knew to reject, 'all that rubbish [about] the evil forces and irrational passions prowling through Africa's heart of darkness', he felt also that the crossroads did have a certain dangerous potency, ‘because a man might perish there wrestling with multiple-headed spirits, but also he might be lucky and return to his people with the boon of prophetic vision’. 
In 1953, at the age of twenty-three Achebe took a degree in English from the prestigious University College, Ibadan, becoming by definition a member of the select élite of educated West Africans who came into adulthood in the 1950s, and who were destined by history to inherit from the colonial powers the task of running the independent nation-states that came into being during the post-Second World War implosion of the empire 'where the sun never sets'. It was a highly educated generation, high achieving and boundless in its aspirations. Its confidence was an embodiment of the all-encompassing spirit of optimism that swept across Africa from desert to coast as emancipation approached. In the wake of the 'Hitler War’, Britain and France had found the task of rebuilding themselves impossible to reconcile with the bedevilled logistics of running empires of continually hostile and endlessly subversive subjects who clamoured for and were in many instances willing to die for — independence.
But the new dawn into which Achebe's generation woke was brief, a conjurer's trick. Even as independence approached, the African states which Winston Churchill had characterized as being nothing but ‘a mere geographical expression' were still afflicted with the debilitating psychosis of their nineteenth-century birth at the Berlin conference hosted by Bismarck. Here they were arbitrarily conjured into existence by an alliance of expansionist European powers who had come together to stake their claims to the treasure trove known as Africa, which they considered theirs to share, and to negotiate the ground rules for sharing it. They had gathered to partition 'the Dark Continent'. Thus began the so-called 'scramble for Africa', the age of empire. In partitioning Africa, they replaced the cartographer’s terra incognita with a map in which ancient foes were Balkanized and forced to live cheek-by-jowl, and whole nations were atomized and divided into states defined no longer by their shared culture, their common heritage, but by the European flags which now held sway over them. Bismarck's conference invented the topography of simmering hatred that would be later utilized by his African clones, that perennial infestation of little tyrants and tin-pot megalomaniacs spread all over Africa propagating internecine bloodbaths whose purpose is, and always has been, not only to unearth and annihilate all manifestations of dissent, but to divide and plunder.
Even as Kwame Nkrumah in the Gold Coast, Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya, Mrs Funmilayo Ransome Kuti in Nigeria and many others all over the continent dared to stare the…",Things Fall Apart (50th Anniversary Edition) (Award-Winning Authors' Books),Chinua Achebe, , ,Penguin group,9780141186887,"1st Edition,1994",200,Abroad,English

Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw aims at amusing the readers by describing Greg Heffley and his problems in life. The book traces his dislike for his father’s impositions, his disdain for Rodrick and the reluctance towards his mother’s demands of studying more.

The book covers the events in Greg’s life during the later half of seventh grade. It contains hilarious situations that Greg has to deal with such as the doing the laundry using laundry hoop gifted by Uncle Charlie. Greg is mortified when his father, impressed by a transformed nasty teenager, Lenwood Heath, who turned decent after attending a military school, decides to send Greg as well. Greg tries hard to distract his father from such terrifying prospects by talking incessantly about soccer and boy scouts. The book shows how an embarrassing incident leads to his father being grateful to him and allowing him to continue his studies in school.

The author expertly details Greg’s subtle and amusing encounters with his family and the lengths to which he goes to get out of troublesome situations.

The Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw is a popular comedy novel in the children’s books category. The book, along with the next one in the series, has been adapted into a film.

Winston Smith, the protagonist of Nineteen Eighty-Four, is a member of the ruling party in the fictional town of Oceania in London. The Party’s leader is Big Brother, who monitors the private and public lives of the people. Posters of ""Big Brother Is Watching You"" dominate Oceania. Each and every action of the people including Winston, are closely monitored. The novel explores totalitarianism and Orwell’s opposition to it.

Winston Smith works in the Ministry of Truth and edits articles for the Party. The Party dominates the entire nation, including areas like language and history. The Party also forces the implementation of a new language called ‘Newspeak’. Its main aim is to prevent political rebellion through elimination of all the words related to it. The Thought Police of the Party restrict any thoughts which are against its Party and any thoughts against the State are regarded as Thoughtcrime.

As the novel progresses, Winston is deeply frustrated by the many rules and rigid oppression of the Party. Winston soon begins to detest the Party which prohibits sex, free thought, or individuality. He purchases a diary illegally and begins to record his criminal thoughts. He also begins an affair with the beautiful and dark-haired Julia. The criminal activities of Winston bring him to the opposition party’s notice. Winston also comes across the mysterious O’Brien. Winston thinks O’Brien is a secret member of the legendary group called the Brotherhood which aims to overthrow the ruling Party.

Will Winston ever be able to escape from Big Brother? How can one reason and think in a nation where everything is fabricated? Who is O'Brien and what does he want from Winston?

Published in 1949, Nineteen Eighty-Four is among Orwell’s best loved works. The novel exerts much influence among its readers and continues to be highly popular even to this day. It has been adapted to the television, radio, film, and theatre formats.

India 2020 is about to become a reality. Are we ready? In 1998, Dr Kalam and Y.S. Rajan published the now iconic India 2020, a vision document for the new millennium that charted how India could become one of the top five economic powers in the world by 2020. Sixteen years later, as the year 2020 approaches, it is time to take stock of how much India has achieved and what lies ahead. 

In many ways, India s growth story in the twenty-first century has been hamstrung by missed opportunities and slowdowns in project execution; but it has also been marked by new opportunities and emerging technologies that make faster and more inclusive growth viable. A renewed policy focus is now needed for agriculture, manufacturing, mining, the chemicals industry, health care and infrastructure to invigorate these sectors and boost economic growth, argue Kalam and Rajan. Alongside, education, job creation, emerging technologies, biodiversity, waste management, national security and the knowledge economy are some of the other vital areas that we need to build on as we look beyond 2020. 

India can still make it to the list of developed nations in a decade. Beyond 2020 provides an action plan for that transformation. (goodreads.com)",Beyond 2020 : A Vision for Tomorrows India,A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, , ,Penguin group,9780143426066,"1st Published,2014",281,India,English

Noam Chomsky is best placed to speak about geopolitics. His experience and voice carry weight and resonate throughout the halls of the government. This collection brings readers some of his speeches and interviews, speaking about myriad topics such as US Foreign Policy, the new global economy, food and Third World economic miracles. He delves into the roots of fascism, and explores the US, the CIA and the government’s clandestine activities. His views on religious fundamentalism, global inequality and the foundation of racism form an interesting read for all, for not only does he touch upon these topics, but also on the ecological catastrophe that is approaching us all, and the myth of the Third World debt.

In The Politics Aristotle addresses the questions that lie at the heart of political science. How should society be ordered to ensure the happiness of the individual? Which forms of government are best and how should they be maintained? By analysing a range of city constitutions - oligarchies, democracies and tyrannies - he seeks to establish the strengths and weaknesses of each system, and to decide which are the most effective, in theory and in practice. A hugely significant work, which has influenced thinkers as diverse as Thomas Aquinas and Machiavelli, The Politics remains an outstanding commentary on fundamental political issues and concerns, and provides fascinating insights into the workings and attitudes of the Greek city-state.
The introductions by T. A. Sinclair and Trevor J. Saunders discuss the influence of The Politics on philosophers, its modern relevance and Aristotle's political beliefs.

Mohan Kumar discovered the pleasures of sex when he was studying in the US. While he is at Princeton University, he loses his virginity to a lovely black woman, Jessica Brown. They continue their relationship for some time. While still in the US, Mohan Kumar also has a relationship with an older woman, Yasmeen, a Pakistani. Having learnt more about lust than probably anything else, he returns to India, to where his father lives. He then gets married.

Mohan Kumar still continues to indulge his lustful passions. When his wife gives birth to a son, it opens up new opportunities for him. One of the nurses hired to take care of the child, Mary Joseph, becomes another of his willing partners.

His wife Sonu is neurotic, and her disposition is not improved by her husband’s constant affairs. Finally, they separate and get a divorce. Mohan’s ruling passion is still sex. He has numerous relationships with many different women, starting with the maid Dhanno. A successful and wealthy businessman now, Mohan starts advertising for the company of women. He has a succeeding line of companions, from an English Professor to a sensual Sri Lankan woman named Susanthika.

In between all this, he has twinges of conscience that try to awaken him to a sense of responsibility, to take a look at where he is going. He also has the occasional need to find spiritual solace by visiting Haridwar, and seeing the Ganga Aarti. The sight of the holy river comforts him, but he still keeps returning to his preferred mode of life.

The Company Of Women deals with love, lust and passion, and obsessive indulgence. Mohan Kumar, despite his faults, has some redeeming moments, like the affection and respect he shows for his father, and the occasional spiritual journeys he has. However, none of these help him rein in his lust.

In Chariots Of The Gods, Erich Von Daniken puts forth the hypothesis than many of the religious and technological events of early human civilization were directly influenced by ancient astronauts or aliens who visited the earth.


Moreover, Daniken claims we are the descendants of these ancient beings. He even cites several archaeological discoveries to prove his claim. Some of these discoveries include a huge spaceport in the Andes, computer astronomy from Egyptian and Incan ruins, and spaceflight navigation charts that are a thousand years old.


Daniken highlights the fact that several complex structures existed well before the technological progress to manufacture them had been accomplished. Some of these structures include the Stonehenge, the Nazca lines in Peru, and the pyramids of Egypt. Daniken claims that the existence of such artifacts can only be explained by the presence of a strong extraterrestrial influence.


He also explains that the traditions of most religions contain references to extraterrestrial presence. However, such references have not withstood the test of time, and have been misinterpreted and obscured by the passage of generations.


The book is backed by the author’s research into lost cities, ancient ruins, and numerous scientific facts. Some of the information presented in the book was later refuted by the author himself, when fresh evidence came to light.


Chariots Of The Gods was first published in 1968. A German documentary based on the book was released in 1970. It was directed by Harald Reinl. It even went on to earn an Oscar nomination. Paradox Entertainment held the rights to the movie adaptation of the book as of March 2009. A theme park based on the book is also in the works. The book was originally written in German. It has been translated into 32 languages since then.

The Fabric Of The Cosmos: Space, Time And The Texture Of Reality is a popular science book that tackles the big questions. It directly asks and attempts to answer questions such as what is reality and whether existence is possible without space and time, can we travel to the past, and what the limits of the universe are. The book from start to finish is an exploration of all that human beings have understood about the makeup of the universe. It is a journey which begins with Classical Physics and ends in the mysterious ten-dimensional M-Theory.

Brian Greene, in this book, has sought to make the non-intuitive, and sometimes counter-intuitive, mathematical concepts and theories accessible to the general audience, and the non-specialists. Concepts and ideas such as String Theory, Inflationary Cosmology, and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle are explained by drawing analogies to common experiences. Undertaking such a task, daunting as it is, stems from Brian’s passion for science and an ability to convert abstract scientific and mathematical ideas into poetic images.

Brian Greene also discusses teleportation, albeit in a more philosophical platform. He then explains in much greater depth the paradoxes of time travel. Additionally, he introduces his readers to his vision of life in a three-brane universe. Towards the end of the book, Greene surveys likely discoveries of the coming decades. The Fabric Of The Cosmos: Space, Time And The Texture Of Reality garnered extensive praise from newspapers and magazines. While Sunday Times recommended it as a must-read, the reviews of the book in Guardian and The New York Times were positive. The book spent half a year on The New York Times Bestseller list.

Marked by a deep personal touch and a classic blend of quick witted humour and detailed analysis of the author’s personal experiences in his personal and professional journey, Truth, Love and A Little Malice may be described as a controversial yet bold attempt by the writer to unabashedly bring to light his personal life experiences.

The book has Singh tracing his familial roots and talking about his family legacy. The book opens up and outgrows into further detailed images of the author’s meetings with political dignitaries. As he openly discusses those meetings with his unique wit, the reader is bound to be surprised yet amazed by his approach.

Being exposed to many post independent events in India, and closely attached politically as a journalist and columnist, the author reveals the deepest secrets of Indian political history in a very different from what we know it as. An example would be when he talks about the welcoming of Maneka Gandhi, as a daughter-in-law into the Gandhi family.
Truth, Love and A Little Malice marks the eventful journey of a bold writer from outside and from within and also reveals details about his first ever relationship and the intimacy surrounding it. The author does not for a minute bother to care about himself or his image and projects himself as a man who has made mistakes in his life.

Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships helps provide the readers with insights into what goes on during most of their social interactions. Berne tells the readers about transactional analysis, which can be utilized for interpreting social interactions. He also examines three roles, which is that of a Parent, Child, and Adult. He explains that a vast majority of behavioral issues stem from confusion of these roles. Berne makes use of an example to illustrate his proposition, which is an office setting where a parent-like boss begins to exercise his authority on his employees. This often results in rebellion, and child-like reactions from his employees.

He also explains that infants can slip into irreversible physical and mental decline due to lack of physical handling. Berne also goes on to throw light on certain studies that elucidate that temporary psychosis may occur due to sensory deprivation in adults. He explains that adults need to interact with individuals, as much as children need to, however, it may not always be possible to do so. This causes an individual to seek emotional strokes from others, which Berne describes as the fundamental unit of social action. He then uses this illustration to explain that exchanging strokes is a transaction, hence the term, Transactional Analysis.

Berne begins to tackle the issue of games played by individuals. He examines one of the most common statements people make, especially married couples, which is ‘If it weren’t for you’. He says that one partner often complains that the other often poses a roadblock in their attempts to do something they want. However, Berne throws light on the fact that individuals actually make such statements to throw the ball in someone else’s court, as a means of camouflaging their own weaknesses.

Quantum theory confronts us with strange paradoxes which refute the logic of conventional physics. At the subatomic level, one particle seems to know what the rest are doing, and according to Heisenberg’s ground-breaking “uncertainty principle”, there is a limit on how precisely nature can be observed by us. And yet, his theory is astoundingly accurate and extensively applied, explaining all of chemistry and most of physics. In this title, the puzzle of the wave-particle dual nature is discussed. Also described are the two questions raised against Bohr’s “Copenhagen Interpretation”, the famous “dead and alive cat”, and the EPR paradox, both of which remain uncertain yet.

The battle for Stalingrad became the focus of Hitler and Stalin's determination to win the gruesome, vicious war on the eastern front. The citizens of Stalingrad endured unimaginable hardship; the battle, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting in each room of each building, was brutally destructive to both armies. But the eventual victory of the Red Army, and the failure of Hitler's Operation Barbarossa, was the first defeat of Hitler's territorial ambitions in Europe, and the start of his decline.

An extraordinary story of tactical genius, civilian bravery, obsession, carnage and the nature of war itself, Stalingrad will act as a testament to the vital role of the soviet war effort.

Untouchable, published in 1935, deals with India’s caste system. Almost 80 years later, the problem still exists in contemporary India.

The story is about Bakha, the protagonist, who is a 18 year old sweeper and toilet cleaner. Bakha is a young and attractive man but is not accepted in the society because he belongs to the lowest of the lower class. His occupation of cleaning toilet makes him an outcast. He is often insulted by people, he is forced to beg for food, is not allowed to touch higher-class Hindus, cannot enter temples and must follows their orders. He tries to dress like Englishmen in hopes that this westernization would rid him of this burden of casteism, but his friends humiliate him for dressing like a sahib to try and be what he is not.

Untouchable describes a day of great difficulty for Bakha. He accidentally touches a upper-caste Hindu and gets slapped for having ‘polluted’ the man. Later on in the day, as he cleans a lady’s gutter, though she gives him food, she throws it on him. Unfortunately, Bakha sister gets molested by a priest on that very day. And Bakha gets blamed for injuring a young boy after a hockey match. As his day goes on, it gets from bad to worse. Finally, Untouchable tells us how Bakha’s father throws him out of the house. Bakha becomes frustrated and tries to find why he has to lead such a miserable and tragic life. He learns about Christianity and about the ways of Mahatma Gandhi. As the plot thickens, Barkha comes to an surprising conclusion.

Untouchable was inspired by the author’s own experiences. His aunt was treated as an outcast in his own family because she had food with a Muslim and later committed suicide. Anand himself had gotten injured after a hockey match and was carried home by a boy of the lower caste. Instead of thanking him, Anand’s mother had beaten up the boy. The book is written in lucid and simple language. This controversial piece of literature established the author as one of India’s leading English writers.

Aristotle’s The Metaphysics is a large philosophical collection of 14 books. Aristotle’s philosophy became the central branch for Western philosophical thought. Aristotle’s metaphysics grew out a reaction against Plato’s idealist doctrine. Aristotle was always concerned with natural phenomena. As a result, he wrote The Metaphysics which combined the rational and natural aspects of the universe.

Aristotle’s principal subject is “being understood as being”. His philosophy asserts that something can be asserted about a thing because it exists, and not because that thing has special traits.

The entire collection of texts, are centered around principal questions such as what it means to exist, what kinds of things exist in this world, and how can beings continue to exist when they undergo change in the world. The first six books in The Metaphysics deal with concepts such as the principal cause of things, how humans acquire wisdom, problems with philosophy, contradiction principles, definitions of key terms, and the hierarchy of sciences. Books 7, 8, and 9, examine concepts such as the essence of being, substance, and the nature of being a human being.

Aristotle also discusses at length, concepts such potentiality and actuality. Books 10 to 14, address the philosophy of Mathematics, unity, and provide further commentaries on the concept of god.

Aristotle’s The Metaphysics is considered to be one of the the greatest philosophical works. In Lawson-Tancred’s translation of The Metaphysics, readers will find an introductory essay that highlights the central themes of the philosophy of metaphysics.

This edition of The Metaphysics was published in 1998, by Penguin Classics.

About Aristotle

At one point in his life, Aristotle established his own school, known as Lyceum. He wrote on numerous topics like linguistics, music, physics, logic, biology, zoology, and on the government. Aristotle had been married twice, and had a son named Nicomachus. He died in 322 BC from natural causes.

A personal memoir, the book also talks about prominent authors and writers who are in some way linked to the city.

Istanbul: Memories And The City is a book that revolves around a serious toddler who lives his life among the complicated lives of his family members. The entire household is ruled by the author’s grandmother, who though old and bedridden, controls the entire family but continuously mourns the fact that her sons are wasting the wealth and fortune of the family. Besides this, the author’s childhood is dominated by his uncle and aunts’ fights, and his parents’ collapsing marriage.

Split between his inner and outer reality, the author creates an alter ego and draws the readers into his dark house crammed with formal yet comfortable furniture, unused pianos, showcases with photographs and jewelry. The unloved and decayed city of Istanbul during the sixties and eighties is aptly described in the book. Applying his prose and skill through the book, the author weaves an intricate story about a city with all its customs and traditions and also provides some self-reflection. All in all, Istanbul: Memories And The City is a stunning novel that begins as the autobiography of the author and eventually becomes the story of an amazing and beautiful city.

About Orhan Pamuk

A Turkish novelist, academician and screenwriter, Orhan Pamuk is also the proud recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, 2006.

A major characteristic that is evident in Pamuk’s entire writing style is a loss of identity and confusion, that is a result of the conflict between the values of the East and West. Often troubling and alarming, the books have complex plots and characters. His works are also based on an admiration for various creative arts like literature and painting.

Other books by the author include The White Castle, My Name is Red, Snow, The Black Book, The Museum of Innocence, and The Silent House.

After graduating from the Institute of Journalism at the University of Istanbul, Pamuk became a full time writer. In March 1982, he married Aylin Türegün and they had a daughter named Rüya in 1991. The couple, however, divorced in 2001. Pamuk is currently in a relationship with Kiran Desai, a prominent author. One of the most prominent storytellers of Turkey, his books have sold more than eleven million copies around the world, and have been translated into almost 60 languages.",Istanbul: Memories of a City (Nobel Prize Winner's),Orhan Pamuk, , ,Penguin group,9780571218332, , ,Abroad,English

There have been innumerable questions that have been raised while talking about merging science and philosophy. Does God exist? Is science somewhere responsible for shaping the faith in God? Our culture and deep rooted values have conditioned us to believe in God, but some still question his existence. So, can one reach a common road between science and spirituality?

With the increasing philosophical scepticism and developments in science, man appeared to lose faith in God. But science itself has proved to be a false god, leaving in its wake a disillusioned and despondent mankind.

The author explains his personal journey that begins in a small town in Bengal, which was rife with turbulent periods that involved a famine and the chaos of the freedom struggle. His life journey, deeply influenced by his father’s and later by Mahatma Gandhi and Satyendranath Bose, is dealt with in detail, with a touch of spirituality.

The discoverer and pioneer of laser technology, thereafter facilitating the LASIK technique, Bhaumik explains, in his book, the reasons behind taking up research in spirituality and then takes a spiritual yet scientific approach to explain the existence and the strong presence of God in the universe.

The book can be seen as one that is divided into three parts. The first part deals with Bhaumik’s personal life amidst the extremities of poverty. The second part deals with his journey into the deep world of science and research, which were a turning point in his life and transformed him from a commoner to a multi-millionnaire. The third and final part is the author’s personal journey as he moves deep into the world of spirituality and begins to question certain realities.

Inspirational and deeply enriching, Code Name God attempts to provide the reader with a simple yet scientific approach to believe in God and to prove his existence.

The Communist Manifesto, which was originally titled as Manifesto of the Communist Party, is an influential political manuscript that lays out the Communist League’s aims and program. The Manifesto presents an analytical insight into the class struggle of the historical and contemporary era. The book also highlights the problems of capitalism.

The Communist Manifesto is divided into 4 sections. The first part is Bourgeois and Proletarians. It focuses on the Communist theory of the history and relation between the Bourgeois and the Proletarians. The next section, Proletarians and Communists, attempts to understand the relationship between Proletarians and Communists. The third part discusses the Socialist and Communist Literature and their flaws. The final part discusses the position of the Communists and its relation to the other opposition parties.

This edition of The Communist Manifesto has been edited by Gareth Stedman Jones. In this edition, he discusses The Reception of the Manifesto, The Communist League, The Spectre of Communism, and Engel’s and Marx’s contributions. Gareth Stedman Jones also discusses the The Young Hegelians including Hegel and Hegelianism, the Emergence of the Young Hegelians, and the Battle over Christianity. It also discuses the Political Economy, Communism, The True Natural History of Man, The Impact of Stirner, and the transformation from Republicanism to Communism.
Written after 4 years of collaboration between Engel and Marx, The Communist Manifesto was originally written in German and published on 21 February 1848. When it was originally published, it raised much controversy. Today, it is an important manifesto, a powerful historical document, and an important classical work.

Over the next forty years, Satyajit Ray came to be regarded as one of the world's finest film-makers ever. Today, more than a decade after his death, he continues to be India's most respected name in international film circles. Apart from his achievements as a director, Ray was also a prolific writer of novels, short stories, and essays on cinema. Speaking of Films brings together some of Ray's most memorable writings on film and film-making. With the masterly precision and clarity that characterize his films, Ray discusses a wide array of subjects: the structure and language of cinema with special reference to his adaptations of Tagore and Bibhuti Bhushan Bandopadhyay, the appropriate use of background music and dialogue in films, the relationship between a film-maker and a film critic, and important develoents in cinema like the advent of sound and colour. He also writes about his own experiences, the challenges of working with rank amateurs, and the innovations called for when making a film in the face of technological, financial and logistical constraints. In the process, Ray provides fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpses of the people who worked with him""the intricacies of getting Chhabi Biswas, who had no ear for music, to play a patron of classical music in Jalsaghar; the incredible memory of the seventy-five-year-old Chunibala Devi, Indir Thakrun of Pather Panchali, and her remarkable attention to details.

But when he accidentally kills a clansman, things begin to fall apart. Then Okonkwo returns from exile to find missionaries and colonial governors have arrived in the village. With his world thrown radically off-balance he can only hurtle towards tragedy. A classic in every sense, Chinua Achebe's stark, coolly ironic novel reshaped both Africa and world literature.
Introduction
Sometime in 1957, an advertisement appeared in the Spectator. The advertiser promised that, for a fee, ‘Authors’ Manuscripts [would be] Typed’. Several thousand miles away in Lagos, the bustling, seaside capital city of the soon-to-be independent British West African colony of Nigeria, an aspiring writer who happened to require the services of a typist came across the advertisement and promptly sent off his manuscript to England. The manuscript, named from a poem by the Irish poet W. B. Yeats, was entitled Things Fall Apart. Its author, the twenty-seven-year-old Chinua Achebe, was a producer with the Nigerian Broadcasting Service. For two years he had occupied his nights and his every free moment with the task of writing, and rigorously editing, the manuscript. It was a staggeringly ambitious work of invocation that was at once a celebration and an interrogation of the mores and culture of the South-eastern Igbo peoples, from whom Achebe descended, and an eloquent rebuttal of the all too casual denigration of Africans by, among others, European writers such as Joseph Conrad (whose quip, about the Congo setting of Heart of Darkness, that he was merely poking around in 'the dead cats of civilization’ has come to define Africa in the western imagination). 
For several months after posting his handwritten manuscript for typing, Achebe heard nothing from England. His polite but firm letters to the London address elicited no response. He was close to despair, convinced that it was lost. And it almost was lost but for the intervention of a friend, a British colleague at the Nigerian Broadcasting Service, who during her annual holiday in England took the time to track down the firm of typists. She returned to Nigeria with a typed copy of the manuscript. A year later, in 1958, William Heinemann published Things Fall Apart, the first title in what became the African Writers Series. The book received instant acclaim. It has since sold over ten million copies and has been translated into forty-five languages.
Chinua Achebe was born on I6 November 1930, in Ogidi, Eastern Nigeria. His great uncle, who brought up Achebe's father, had taken the highest-but-one title' in the clan, and was considered to be of such importance that when in the late nineteenth century Anglican missionaries came to Ogidi, and sought support for their work, they were shown to his compound. ‘For a short while he allowed them to operate from his compound,’ Achebe says in an essay written nearly a century later, ‘but after a few days he sent them packing again.’ Not because he found their theology offensive, but because he found their music alarming. ‘Your music is too sad to come from a man’s house,’ Achebe's great uncle told the missionaries, ‘my neighbours might think it was my funeral dirge.’ Achebe's father on the other hand had no such reservations about the new creed. He joined the missionaries, received an education from them, and became, in 1904, a teacher and catechist for the Anglican Church. Achebe grew up in a home where they sang hymns and read the Bible night and day. But he would often sneak across to his ‘heathen’ uncle's compound and partake in pagan festival’s of rice and stew. To his delight, he found in the food no flavour of idolatry. The converts to the new creed looked down on the non-Christians in the village, calling them 'the people of nothing.’ But Achebe did not suffer from an identity crisis over the two cultures contesting for his devotion. He lived at the crossroads of culture and although, as he grew up, he knew to reject, 'all that rubbish [about] the evil forces and irrational passions prowling through Africa's heart of darkness', he felt also that the crossroads did have a certain dangerous potency, ‘because a man might perish there wrestling with multiple-headed spirits, but also he might be lucky and return to his people with the boon of prophetic vision’. 
In 1953, at the age of twenty-three Achebe took a degree in English from the prestigious University College, Ibadan, becoming by definition a member of the select élite of educated West Africans who came into adulthood in the 1950s, and who were destined by history to inherit from the colonial powers the task of running the independent nation-states that came into being during the post-Second World War implosion of the empire 'where the sun never sets'. It was a highly educated generation, high achieving and boundless in its aspirations. Its confidence was an embodiment of the all-encompassing spirit of optimism that swept across Africa from desert to coast as emancipation approached. In the wake of the 'Hitler War’, Britain and France had found the task of rebuilding themselves impossible to reconcile with the bedevilled logistics of running empires of continually hostile and endlessly subversive subjects who clamoured for and were in many instances willing to die for — independence.
But the new dawn into which Achebe's generation woke was brief, a conjurer's trick. Even as independence approached, the African states which Winston Churchill had characterized as being nothing but ‘a mere geographical expression' were still afflicted with the debilitating psychosis of their nineteenth-century birth at the Berlin conference hosted by Bismarck. Here they were arbitrarily conjured into existence by an alliance of expansionist European powers who had come together to stake their claims to the treasure trove known as Africa, which they considered theirs to share, and to negotiate the ground rules for sharing it. They had gathered to partition 'the Dark Continent'. Thus began the so-called 'scramble for Africa', the age of empire. In partitioning Africa, they replaced the cartographer’s terra incognita with a map in which ancient foes were Balkanized and forced to live cheek-by-jowl, and whole nations were atomized and divided into states defined no longer by their shared culture, their common heritage, but by the European flags which now held sway over them. Bismarck's conference invented the topography of simmering hatred that would be later utilized by his African clones, that perennial infestation of little tyrants and tin-pot megalomaniacs spread all over Africa propagating internecine bloodbaths whose purpose is, and always has been, not only to unearth and annihilate all manifestations of dissent, but to divide and plunder.
Even as Kwame Nkrumah in the Gold Coast, Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya, Mrs Funmilayo Ransome Kuti in Nigeria and many others all over the continent dared to stare the…",Things Fall Apart (50th Anniversary Edition) (Award-Winning Authors' Books),Chinua Achebe, , ,Penguin group,9780141186887,"1st Edition,1994",200,Abroad,English

Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw aims at amusing the readers by describing Greg Heffley and his problems in life. The book traces his dislike for his father’s impositions, his disdain for Rodrick and the reluctance towards his mother’s demands of studying more.

The book covers the events in Greg’s life during the later half of seventh grade. It contains hilarious situations that Greg has to deal with such as the doing the laundry using laundry hoop gifted by Uncle Charlie. Greg is mortified when his father, impressed by a transformed nasty teenager, Lenwood Heath, who turned decent after attending a military school, decides to send Greg as well. Greg tries hard to distract his father from such terrifying prospects by talking incessantly about soccer and boy scouts. The book shows how an embarrassing incident leads to his father being grateful to him and allowing him to continue his studies in school.

The author expertly details Greg’s subtle and amusing encounters with his family and the lengths to which he goes to get out of troublesome situations.

The Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw is a popular comedy novel in the children’s books category. The book, along with the next one in the series, has been adapted into a film.

Winston Smith, the protagonist of Nineteen Eighty-Four, is a member of the ruling party in the fictional town of Oceania in London. The Party’s leader is Big Brother, who monitors the private and public lives of the people. Posters of ""Big Brother Is Watching You"" dominate Oceania. Each and every action of the people including Winston, are closely monitored. The novel explores totalitarianism and Orwell’s opposition to it.

Winston Smith works in the Ministry of Truth and edits articles for the Party. The Party dominates the entire nation, including areas like language and history. The Party also forces the implementation of a new language called ‘Newspeak’. Its main aim is to prevent political rebellion through elimination of all the words related to it. The Thought Police of the Party restrict any thoughts which are against its Party and any thoughts against the State are regarded as Thoughtcrime.

As the novel progresses, Winston is deeply frustrated by the many rules and rigid oppression of the Party. Winston soon begins to detest the Party which prohibits sex, free thought, or individuality. He purchases a diary illegally and begins to record his criminal thoughts. He also begins an affair with the beautiful and dark-haired Julia. The criminal activities of Winston bring him to the opposition party’s notice. Winston also comes across the mysterious O’Brien. Winston thinks O’Brien is a secret member of the legendary group called the Brotherhood which aims to overthrow the ruling Party.

Will Winston ever be able to escape from Big Brother? How can one reason and think in a nation where everything is fabricated? Who is O'Brien and what does he want from Winston?

Published in 1949, Nineteen Eighty-Four is among Orwell’s best loved works. The novel exerts much influence among its readers and continues to be highly popular even to this day. It has been adapted to the television, radio, film, and theatre formats.

India 2020 is about to become a reality. Are we ready? In 1998, Dr Kalam and Y.S. Rajan published the now iconic India 2020, a vision document for the new millennium that charted how India could become one of the top five economic powers in the world by 2020. Sixteen years later, as the year 2020 approaches, it is time to take stock of how much India has achieved and what lies ahead. 

In many ways, India s growth story in the twenty-first century has been hamstrung by missed opportunities and slowdowns in project execution; but it has also been marked by new opportunities and emerging technologies that make faster and more inclusive growth viable. A renewed policy focus is now needed for agriculture, manufacturing, mining, the chemicals industry, health care and infrastructure to invigorate these sectors and boost economic growth, argue Kalam and Rajan. Alongside, education, job creation, emerging technologies, biodiversity, waste management, national security and the knowledge economy are some of the other vital areas that we need to build on as we look beyond 2020. 

India can still make it to the list of developed nations in a decade. Beyond 2020 provides an action plan for that transformation. (goodreads.com)",Beyond 2020 : A Vision for Tomorrows India,A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, , ,Penguin group,9780143426066,"1st Published,2014",281,India,English

Noam Chomsky is best placed to speak about geopolitics. His experience and voice carry weight and resonate throughout the halls of the government. This collection brings readers some of his speeches and interviews, speaking about myriad topics such as US Foreign Policy, the new global economy, food and Third World economic miracles. He delves into the roots of fascism, and explores the US, the CIA and the government’s clandestine activities. His views on religious fundamentalism, global inequality and the foundation of racism form an interesting read for all, for not only does he touch upon these topics, but also on the ecological catastrophe that is approaching us all, and the myth of the Third World debt.

In The Politics Aristotle addresses the questions that lie at the heart of political science. How should society be ordered to ensure the happiness of the individual? Which forms of government are best and how should they be maintained? By analysing a range of city constitutions - oligarchies, democracies and tyrannies - he seeks to establish the strengths and weaknesses of each system, and to decide which are the most effective, in theory and in practice. A hugely significant work, which has influenced thinkers as diverse as Thomas Aquinas and Machiavelli, The Politics remains an outstanding commentary on fundamental political issues and concerns, and provides fascinating insights into the workings and attitudes of the Greek city-state.

Mohan Kumar discovered the pleasures of sex when he was studying in the US. While he is at Princeton University, he loses his virginity to a lovely black woman, Jessica Brown. They continue their relationship for some time. While still in the US, Mohan Kumar also has a relationship with an older woman, Yasmeen, a Pakistani. Having learnt more about lust than probably anything else, he returns to India, to where his father lives. He then gets married.

Mohan Kumar still continues to indulge his lustful passions. When his wife gives birth to a son, it opens up new opportunities for him. One of the nurses hired to take care of the child, Mary Joseph, becomes another of his willing partners.

His wife Sonu is neurotic, and her disposition is not improved by her husband’s constant affairs. Finally, they separate and get a divorce. Mohan’s ruling passion is still sex. He has numerous relationships with many different women, starting with the maid Dhanno. A successful and wealthy businessman now, Mohan starts advertising for the company of women. He has a succeeding line of companions, from an English Professor to a sensual Sri Lankan woman named Susanthika.

In between all this, he has twinges of conscience that try to awaken him to a sense of responsibility, to take a look at where he is going. He also has the occasional need to find spiritual solace by visiting Haridwar, and seeing the Ganga Aarti. The sight of the holy river comforts him, but he still keeps returning to his preferred mode of life.

The Company Of Women deals with love, lust and passion, and obsessive indulgence. Mohan Kumar, despite his faults, has some redeeming moments, like the affection and respect he shows for his father, and the occasional spiritual journeys he has. However, none of these help him rein in his lust.

In Chariots Of The Gods, Erich Von Daniken puts forth the hypothesis than many of the religious and technological events of early human civilization were directly influenced by ancient astronauts or aliens who visited the earth.


Moreover, Daniken claims we are the descendants of these ancient beings. He even cites several archaeological discoveries to prove his claim. Some of these discoveries include a huge spaceport in the Andes, computer astronomy from Egyptian and Incan ruins, and spaceflight navigation charts that are a thousand years old.


Daniken highlights the fact that several complex structures existed well before the technological progress to manufacture them had been accomplished. Some of these structures include the Stonehenge, the Nazca lines in Peru, and the pyramids of Egypt. Daniken claims that the existence of such artifacts can only be explained by the presence of a strong extraterrestrial influence.


He also explains that the traditions of most religions contain references to extraterrestrial presence. However, such references have not withstood the test of time, and have been misinterpreted and obscured by the passage of generations.


The book is backed by the author’s research into lost cities, ancient ruins, and numerous scientific facts. Some of the information presented in the book was later refuted by the author himself, when fresh evidence came to light.


Chariots Of The Gods was first published in 1968. A German documentary based on the book was released in 1970. It was directed by Harald Reinl. It even went on to earn an Oscar nomination. Paradox Entertainment held the rights to the movie adaptation of the book as of March 2009. A theme park based on the book is also in the works. The book was originally written in German. It has been translated into 32 languages since then.

The Fabric Of The Cosmos: Space, Time And The Texture Of Reality is a popular science book that tackles the big questions. It directly asks and attempts to answer questions such as what is reality and whether existence is possible without space and time, can we travel to the past, and what the limits of the universe are. The book from start to finish is an exploration of all that human beings have understood about the makeup of the universe. It is a journey which begins with Classical Physics and ends in the mysterious ten-dimensional M-Theory.

Brian Greene, in this book, has sought to make the non-intuitive, and sometimes counter-intuitive, mathematical concepts and theories accessible to the general audience, and the non-specialists. Concepts and ideas such as String Theory, Inflationary Cosmology, and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle are explained by drawing analogies to common experiences. Undertaking such a task, daunting as it is, stems from Brian’s passion for science and an ability to convert abstract scientific and mathematical ideas into poetic images.

Brian Greene also discusses teleportation, albeit in a more philosophical platform. He then explains in much greater depth the paradoxes of time travel. Additionally, he introduces his readers to his vision of life in a three-brane universe. Towards the end of the book, Greene surveys likely discoveries of the coming decades. The Fabric Of The Cosmos: Space, Time And The Texture Of Reality garnered extensive praise from newspapers and magazines. While Sunday Times recommended it as a must-read, the reviews of the book in Guardian and The New York Times were positive. The book spent half a year on The New York Times Bestseller list.

Marked by a deep personal touch and a classic blend of quick witted humour and detailed analysis of the author’s personal experiences in his personal and professional journey, Truth, Love and A Little Malice may be described as a controversial yet bold attempt by the writer to unabashedly bring to light his personal life experiences.

The book has Singh tracing his familial roots and talking about his family legacy. The book opens up and outgrows into further detailed images of the author’s meetings with political dignitaries. As he openly discusses those meetings with his unique wit, the reader is bound to be surprised yet amazed by his approach.

Being exposed to many post independent events in India, and closely attached politically as a journalist and columnist, the author reveals the deepest secrets of Indian political history in a very different from what we know it as. An example would be when he talks about the welcoming of Maneka Gandhi, as a daughter-in-law into the Gandhi family.
Truth, Love and A Little Malice marks the eventful journey of a bold writer from outside and from within and also reveals details about his first ever relationship and the intimacy surrounding it. The author does not for a minute bother to care about himself or his image and projects himself as a man who has made mistakes in his life.

Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships helps provide the readers with insights into what goes on during most of their social interactions. Berne tells the readers about transactional analysis, which can be utilized for interpreting social interactions. He also examines three roles, which is that of a Parent, Child, and Adult. He explains that a vast majority of behavioral issues stem from confusion of these roles. Berne makes use of an example to illustrate his proposition, which is an office setting where a parent-like boss begins to exercise his authority on his employees. This often results in rebellion, and child-like reactions from his employees.

He also explains that infants can slip into irreversible physical and mental decline due to lack of physical handling. Berne also goes on to throw light on certain studies that elucidate that temporary psychosis may occur due to sensory deprivation in adults. He explains that adults need to interact with individuals, as much as children need to, however, it may not always be possible to do so. This causes an individual to seek emotional strokes from others, which Berne describes as the fundamental unit of social action. He then uses this illustration to explain that exchanging strokes is a transaction, hence the term, Transactional Analysis.

Berne begins to tackle the issue of games played by individuals. He examines one of the most common statements people make, especially married couples, which is ‘If it weren’t for you’. He says that one partner often complains that the other often poses a roadblock in their attempts to do something they want. However, Berne throws light on the fact that individuals actually make such statements to throw the ball in someone else’s court, as a means of camouflaging their own weaknesses.

Quantum theory confronts us with strange paradoxes which refute the logic of conventional physics. At the subatomic level, one particle seems to know what the rest are doing, and according to Heisenberg’s ground-breaking “uncertainty principle”, there is a limit on how precisely nature can be observed by us. And yet, his theory is astoundingly accurate and extensively applied, explaining all of chemistry and most of physics. In this title, the puzzle of the wave-particle dual nature is discussed. Also described are the two questions raised against Bohr’s “Copenhagen Interpretation”, the famous “dead and alive cat”, and the EPR paradox, both of which remain uncertain yet.

The citizens of Stalingrad endured unimaginable hardship; the battle, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting in each room of each building, was brutally destructive to both armies. But the eventual victory of the Red Army, and the failure of Hitler's Operation Barbarossa, was the first defeat of Hitler's territorial ambitions in Europe, and the start of his decline.

An extraordinary story of tactical genius, civilian bravery, obsession, carnage and the nature of war itself, Stalingrad will act as a testament to the vital role of the soviet war effort.

Dyer has researched intention as a force in the universe that allows the act of creation to take place. This book explores intention-not as something you do-but as an energy you're a part of.

Untouchable, published in 1935, deals with India’s caste system. Almost 80 years later, the problem still exists in contemporary India.

The story is about Bakha, the protagonist, who is a 18 year old sweeper and toilet cleaner. Bakha is a young and attractive man but is not accepted in the society because he belongs to the lowest of the lower class. His occupation of cleaning toilet makes him an outcast. He is often insulted by people, he is forced to beg for food, is not allowed to touch higher-class Hindus, cannot enter temples and must follows their orders. He tries to dress like Englishmen in hopes that this westernization would rid him of this burden of casteism, but his friends humiliate him for dressing like a sahib to try and be what he is not.

Untouchable describes a day of great difficulty for Bakha. He accidentally touches a upper-caste Hindu and gets slapped for having ‘polluted’ the man. Later on in the day, as he cleans a lady’s gutter, though she gives him food, she throws it on him. Unfortunately, Bakha sister gets molested by a priest on that very day. And Bakha gets blamed for injuring a young boy after a hockey match. As his day goes on, it gets from bad to worse. Finally, Untouchable tells us how Bakha’s father throws him out of the house. Bakha becomes frustrated and tries to find why he has to lead such a miserable and tragic life. He learns about Christianity and about the ways of Mahatma Gandhi. As the plot thickens, Barkha comes to an surprising conclusion.

Untouchable was inspired by the author’s own experiences. His aunt was treated as an outcast in his own family because she had food with a Muslim and later committed suicide. Anand himself had gotten injured after a hockey match and was carried home by a boy of the lower caste. Instead of thanking him, Anand’s mother had beaten up the boy. The book is written in lucid and simple language. This controversial piece of literature established the author as one of India’s leading English writers.

Aristotle’s The Metaphysics is a large philosophical collection of 14 books. Aristotle’s philosophy became the central branch for Western philosophical thought. Aristotle’s metaphysics grew out a reaction against Plato’s idealist doctrine. Aristotle was always concerned with natural phenomena. As a result, he wrote The Metaphysics which combined the rational and natural aspects of the universe.

Aristotle’s principal subject is “being understood as being”. His philosophy asserts that something can be asserted about a thing because it exists, and not because that thing has special traits.

The entire collection of texts, are centered around principal questions such as what it means to exist, what kinds of things exist in this world, and how can beings continue to exist when they undergo change in the world. The first six books in The Metaphysics deal with concepts such as the principal cause of things, how humans acquire wisdom, problems with philosophy, contradiction principles, definitions of key terms, and the hierarchy of sciences. Books 7, 8, and 9, examine concepts such as the essence of being, substance, and the nature of being a human being.

Aristotle also discusses at length, concepts such potentiality and actuality. Books 10 to 14, address the philosophy of Mathematics, unity, and provide further commentaries on the concept of god.

Aristotle’s The Metaphysics is considered to be one of the the greatest philosophical works. In Lawson-Tancred’s translation of The Metaphysics, readers will find an introductory essay that highlights the central themes of the philosophy of metaphysics.

This edition of The Metaphysics was published in 1998, by Penguin Classics.

About Aristotle

Aristotle was a Greek philosopher, and the founder of the metaphysical branch of philosophy.

Aristotle was the Head at the Royal Academy in Macedon. He had many notable people under his tutelage such as Alexander, Cassander, and Ptolemy. Aristotle was interested in learning about all things natural. As a result, he wrote many treatises on topics such as astronomy, embryology, literature, and foreign customs. At one point in his life, Aristotle established his own school, known as Lyceum. He wrote on numerous topics like linguistics, music, physics, logic, biology, zoology, and on the government. Aristotle had been married twice, and had a son named Nicomachus. He died in 322 BC from natural causes.

Merging the life of a writer with the city of his childhood is a truly natural and exciting proposition. This becomes all the more true for an author who has come to symbolize the liberal face of Turkey. Istanbul: Memories And The City by Orhan Pamuk is a shimmering evocation of a city that is both intimate and panoramic. Written with a sense of melancholy, the author describes his life and how the change in the city has affected and shaped the manner in which he perceives the city. A personal memoir, the book also talks about prominent authors and writers who are in some way linked to the city.

Istanbul: Memories And The City is a book that revolves around a serious toddler who lives his life among the complicated lives of his family members. The entire household is ruled by the author’s grandmother, who though old and bedridden, controls the entire family but continuously mourns the fact that her sons are wasting the wealth and fortune of the family. Besides this, the author’s childhood is dominated by his uncle and aunts’ fights, and his parents’ collapsing marriage.

Split between his inner and outer reality, the author creates an alter ego and draws the readers into his dark house crammed with formal yet comfortable furniture, unused pianos, showcases with photographs and jewelry. The unloved and decayed city of Istanbul during the sixties and eighties is aptly described in the book. Applying his prose and skill through the book, the author weaves an intricate story about a city with all its customs and traditions and also provides some self-reflection. All in all, Istanbul: Memories And The City is a stunning novel that begins as the autobiography of the author and eventually becomes the story of an amazing and beautiful city.

About Orhan Pamuk

A Turkish novelist, academician and screenwriter, Orhan Pamuk is also the proud recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, 2006.

A major characteristic that is evident in Pamuk’s entire writing style is a loss of identity and confusion, that is a result of the conflict between the values of the East and West. Often troubling and alarming, the books have complex plots and characters. His works are also based on an admiration for various creative arts like literature and painting.

Other books by the author include The White Castle, My Name is Red, Snow, The Black Book, The Museum of Innocence, and The Silent House.

After graduating from the Institute of Journalism at the University of Istanbul, Pamuk became a full time writer. In March 1982, he married Aylin Türegün and they had a daughter named Rüya in 1991. The couple, however, divorced in 2001. Pamuk is currently in a relationship with Kiran Desai, a prominent author. One of the most prominent storytellers of Turkey, his books have sold more than eleven million copies around the world, and have been translated into almost 60 languages.",Istanbul: Memories of a City (Nobel Prize Winner's),Orhan Pamuk, , ,Penguin group,9780571218332, , ,Abroad,English

There have been innumerable questions that have been raised while talking about merging science and philosophy. Does God exist? Is science somewhere responsible for shaping the faith in God? Our culture and deep rooted values have conditioned us to believe in God, but some still question his existence. So, can one reach a common road between science and spirituality?

With the increasing philosophical scepticism and developments in science, man appeared to lose faith in God. But science itself has proved to be a false god, leaving in its wake a disillusioned and despondent mankind.

The author explains his personal journey that begins in a small town in Bengal, which was rife with turbulent periods that involved a famine and the chaos of the freedom struggle. His life journey, deeply influenced by his father’s and later by Mahatma Gandhi and Satyendranath Bose, is dealt with in detail, with a touch of spirituality.

The discoverer and pioneer of laser technology, thereafter facilitating the LASIK technique, Bhaumik explains, in his book, the reasons behind taking up research in spirituality and then takes a spiritual yet scientific approach to explain the existence and the strong presence of God in the universe.

The book can be seen as one that is divided into three parts. The first part deals with Bhaumik’s personal life amidst the extremities of poverty. The second part deals with his journey into the deep world of science and research, which were a turning point in his life and transformed him from a commoner to a multi-millionnaire. The third and final part is the author’s personal journey as he moves deep into the world of spirituality and begins to question certain realities.

Inspirational and deeply enriching, Code Name God attempts to provide the reader with a simple yet scientific approach to believe in God and to prove his existence.

Over the next forty years, Satyajit Ray came to be regarded as one of the world's finest film-makers ever. Today, more than a decade after his death, he continues to be India's most respected name in international film circles. Apart from his achievements as a director, Ray was also a prolific writer of novels, short stories, and essays on cinema. Speaking of Films brings together some of Ray's most memorable writings on film and film-making. With the masterly precision and clarity that characterize his films, Ray discusses a wide array of subjects: the structure and language of cinema with special reference to his adaptations of Tagore and Bibhuti Bhushan Bandopadhyay, the appropriate use of background music and dialogue in films, the relationship between a film-maker and a film critic, and important develoents in cinema like the advent of sound and colour. He also writes about his own experiences, the challenges of working with rank amateurs, and the innovations called for when making a film in the face of technological, financial and logistical constraints. In the process, Ray provides fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpses of the people who worked with him""the intricacies of getting Chhabi Biswas, who had no ear for music, to play a patron of classical music in Jalsaghar; the incredible memory of the seventy-five-year-old Chunibala Devi, Indir Thakrun of Pather Panchali, and her remarkable attention to details. This first-ever translation of Bishay Chalachitra, a seminal collection of essays on cinema, Speaking of Films retains the lucidity and simplicity that is a hallmark of Ray's writing, and gives an invaluable insight into the mind of a genius.",Speaking Of Films,Satyajit Ray, , ,Penguin group,9780144000265,"1st Published,2005",220,India,English

But when he accidentally kills a clansman, things begin to fall apart. Then Okonkwo returns from exile to find missionaries and colonial governors have arrived in the village. With his world thrown radically off-balance he can only hurtle towards tragedy. A classic in every sense, Chinua Achebe's stark, coolly ironic novel reshaped both Africa and world literature.
Introduction
Sometime in 1957, an advertisement appeared in the Spectator. The advertiser promised that, for a fee, ‘Authors’ Manuscripts [would be] Typed’. Several thousand miles away in Lagos, the bustling, seaside capital city of the soon-to-be independent British West African colony of Nigeria, an aspiring writer who happened to require the services of a typist came across the advertisement and promptly sent off his manuscript to England. The manuscript, named from a poem by the Irish poet W. B. Yeats, was entitled Things Fall Apart. Its author, the twenty-seven-year-old Chinua Achebe, was a producer with the Nigerian Broadcasting Service. For two years he had occupied his nights and his every free moment with the task of writing, and rigorously editing, the manuscript. It was a staggeringly ambitious work of invocation that was at once a celebration and an interrogation of the mores and culture of the South-eastern Igbo peoples, from whom Achebe descended, and an eloquent rebuttal of the all too casual denigration of Africans by, among others, European writers such as Joseph Conrad (whose quip, about the Congo setting of Heart of Darkness, that he was merely poking around in 'the dead cats of civilization’ has come to define Africa in the western imagination). 
For several months after posting his handwritten manuscript for typing, Achebe heard nothing from England. His polite but firm letters to the London address elicited no response. He was close to despair, convinced that it was lost. And it almost was lost but for the intervention of a friend, a British colleague at the Nigerian Broadcasting Service, who during her annual holiday in England took the time to track down the firm of typists. She returned to Nigeria with a typed copy of the manuscript. A year later, in 1958, William Heinemann published Things Fall Apart, the first title in what became the African Writers Series. The book received instant acclaim. It has since sold over ten million copies and has been translated into forty-five languages.
Chinua Achebe was born on I6 November 1930, in Ogidi, Eastern Nigeria. His great uncle, who brought up Achebe's father, had taken the highest-but-one title' in the clan, and was considered to be of such importance that when in the late nineteenth century Anglican missionaries came to Ogidi, and sought support for their work, they were shown to his compound. ‘For a short while he allowed them to operate from his compound,’ Achebe says in an essay written nearly a century later, ‘but after a few days he sent them packing again.’ Not because he found their theology offensive, but because he found their music alarming. ‘Your music is too sad to come from a man’s house,’ Achebe's great uncle told the missionaries, ‘my neighbours might think it was my funeral dirge.’ Achebe's father on the other hand had no such reservations about the new creed. He joined the missionaries, received an education from them, and became, in 1904, a teacher and catechist for the Anglican Church. Achebe grew up in a home where they sang hymns and read the Bible night and day. But he would often sneak across to his ‘heathen’ uncle's compound and partake in pagan festival’s of rice and stew. To his delight, he found in the food no flavour of idolatry. The converts to the new creed looked down on the non-Christians in the village, calling them 'the people of nothing.’ But Achebe did not suffer from an identity crisis over the two cultures contesting for his devotion. He lived at the crossroads of culture and although, as he grew up, he knew to reject, 'all that rubbish [about] the evil forces and irrational passions prowling through Africa's heart of darkness', he felt also that the crossroads did have a certain dangerous potency, ‘because a man might perish there wrestling with multiple-headed spirits, but also he might be lucky and return to his people with the boon of prophetic vision’. 
In 1953, at the age of twenty-three Achebe took a degree in English from the prestigious University College, Ibadan, becoming by definition a member of the select élite of educated West Africans who came into adulthood in the 1950s, and who were destined by history to inherit from the colonial powers the task of running the independent nation-states that came into being during the post-Second World War implosion of the empire 'where the sun never sets'. It was a highly educated generation, high achieving and boundless in its aspirations. Its confidence was an embodiment of the all-encompassing spirit of optimism that swept across Africa from desert to coast as emancipation approached. In the wake of the 'Hitler War’, Britain and France had found the task of rebuilding themselves impossible to reconcile with the bedevilled logistics of running empires of continually hostile and endlessly subversive subjects who clamoured for and were in many instances willing to die for — independence.
But the new dawn into which Achebe's generation woke was brief, a conjurer's trick. Even as independence approached, the African states which Winston Churchill had characterized as being nothing but ‘a mere geographical expression' were still afflicted with the debilitating psychosis of their nineteenth-century birth at the Berlin conference hosted by Bismarck. Here they were arbitrarily conjured into existence by an alliance of expansionist European powers who had come together to stake their claims to the treasure trove known as Africa, which they considered theirs to share, and to negotiate the ground rules for sharing it. They had gathered to partition 'the Dark Continent'. Thus began the so-called 'scramble for Africa', the age of empire. In partitioning Africa, they replaced the cartographer’s terra incognita with a map in which ancient foes were Balkanized and forced to live cheek-by-jowl, and whole nations were atomized and divided into states defined no longer by their shared culture, their common heritage, but by the European flags which now held sway over them. Bismarck's conference invented the topography of simmering hatred that would be later utilized by his African clones, that perennial infestation of little tyrants and tin-pot megalomaniacs spread all over Africa propagating internecine bloodbaths whose purpose is, and always has been, not only to unearth and annihilate all manifestations of dissent, but to divide and plunder.
Even as Kwame Nkrumah in the Gold Coast, Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya, Mrs Funmilayo Ransome Kuti in Nigeria and many others all over the continent dared to stare the…",Things Fall Apart (50th Anniversary Edition) (Award-Winning Authors' Books),Chinua Achebe, , ,Penguin group,9780141186887,"1st Edition,1994",200,Abroad,English

Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw aims at amusing the readers by describing Greg Heffley and his problems in life. The book traces his dislike for his father’s impositions, his disdain for Rodrick and the reluctance towards his mother’s demands of studying more.

The book covers the events in Greg’s life during the later half of seventh grade. It contains hilarious situations that Greg has to deal with such as the doing the laundry using laundry hoop gifted by Uncle Charlie. Greg is mortified when his father, impressed by a transformed nasty teenager, Lenwood Heath, who turned decent after attending a military school, decides to send Greg as well. Greg tries hard to distract his father from such terrifying prospects by talking incessantly about soccer and boy scouts. The book shows how an embarrassing incident leads to his father being grateful to him and allowing him to continue his studies in school.

The author expertly details Greg’s subtle and amusing encounters with his family and the lengths to which he goes to get out of troublesome situations.

The Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw is a popular comedy novel in the children’s books category. The book, along with the next one in the series, has been adapted into a film.

Winston Smith, the protagonist of Nineteen Eighty-Four, is a member of the ruling party in the fictional town of Oceania in London. The Party’s leader is Big Brother, who monitors the private and public lives of the people. Posters of ""Big Brother Is Watching You"" dominate Oceania. Each and every action of the people including Winston, are closely monitored. The novel explores totalitarianism and Orwell’s opposition to it.

Winston Smith works in the Ministry of Truth and edits articles for the Party. The Party dominates the entire nation, including areas like language and history. The Party also forces the implementation of a new language called ‘Newspeak’. Its main aim is to prevent political rebellion through elimination of all the words related to it. The Thought Police of the Party restrict any thoughts which are against its Party and any thoughts against the State are regarded as Thoughtcrime.

As the novel progresses, Winston is deeply frustrated by the many rules and rigid oppression of the Party. Winston soon begins to detest the Party which prohibits sex, free thought, or individuality. He purchases a diary illegally and begins to record his criminal thoughts. He also begins an affair with the beautiful and dark-haired Julia. The criminal activities of Winston bring him to the opposition party’s notice. Winston also comes across the mysterious O’Brien. Winston thinks O’Brien is a secret member of the legendary group called the Brotherhood which aims to overthrow the ruling Party.

Will Winston ever be able to escape from Big Brother? How can one reason and think in a nation where everything is fabricated? Who is O'Brien and what does he want from Winston?

Published in 1949, Nineteen Eighty-Four is among Orwell’s best loved works. The novel exerts much influence among its readers and continues to be highly popular even to this day. It has been adapted to the television, radio, film, and theatre formats.

India 2020 is about to become a reality. Are we ready? In 1998, Dr Kalam and Y.S. Rajan published the now iconic India 2020, a vision document for the new millennium that charted how India could become one of the top five economic powers in the world by 2020. Sixteen years later, as the year 2020 approaches, it is time to take stock of how much India has achieved and what lies ahead. 

In many ways, India s growth story in the twenty-first century has been hamstrung by missed opportunities and slowdowns in project execution; but it has also been marked by new opportunities and emerging technologies that make faster and more inclusive growth viable. A renewed policy focus is now needed for agriculture, manufacturing, mining, the chemicals industry, health care and infrastructure to invigorate these sectors and boost economic growth, argue Kalam and Rajan. Alongside, education, job creation, emerging technologies, biodiversity, waste management, national security and the knowledge economy are some of the other vital areas that we need to build on as we look beyond 2020. 

India can still make it to the list of developed nations in a decade. Beyond 2020 provides an action plan for that transformation. (goodreads.com)",Beyond 2020 : A Vision for Tomorrows India,A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, , ,Penguin group,9780143426066,"1st Published,2014",281,India,English

Noam Chomsky is best placed to speak about geopolitics. His experience and voice carry weight and resonate throughout the halls of the government. This collection brings readers some of his speeches and interviews, speaking about myriad topics such as US Foreign Policy, the new global economy, food and Third World economic miracles. He delves into the roots of fascism, and explores the US, the CIA and the government’s clandestine activities. His views on religious fundamentalism, global inequality and the foundation of racism form an interesting read for all, for not only does he touch upon these topics, but also on the ecological catastrophe that is approaching us all, and the myth of the Third World debt.

In The Politics Aristotle addresses the questions that lie at the heart of political science. How should society be ordered to ensure the happiness of the individual? Which forms of government are best and how should they be maintained? By analysing a range of city constitutions - oligarchies, democracies and tyrannies - he seeks to establish the strengths and weaknesses of each system, and to decide which are the most effective, in theory and in practice. A hugely significant work, which has influenced thinkers as diverse as Thomas Aquinas and Machiavelli, The Politics remains an outstanding commentary on fundamental political issues and concerns, and provides fascinating insights into the workings and attitudes of the Greek city-state.
The introductions by T. A. Sinclair and Trevor J. Saunders discuss the influence of The Politics on philosophers, its modern relevance and Aristotle's political beliefs.

Mohan Kumar discovered the pleasures of sex when he was studying in the US. While he is at Princeton University, he loses his virginity to a lovely black woman, Jessica Brown. They continue their relationship for some time. While still in the US, Mohan Kumar also has a relationship with an older woman, Yasmeen, a Pakistani. Having learnt more about lust than probably anything else, he returns to India, to where his father lives. He then gets married.

Mohan Kumar still continues to indulge his lustful passions. When his wife gives birth to a son, it opens up new opportunities for him. One of the nurses hired to take care of the child, Mary Joseph, becomes another of his willing partners.

His wife Sonu is neurotic, and her disposition is not improved by her husband’s constant affairs. Finally, they separate and get a divorce. Mohan’s ruling passion is still sex. He has numerous relationships with many different women, starting with the maid Dhanno. A successful and wealthy businessman now, Mohan starts advertising for the company of women. He has a succeeding line of companions, from an English Professor to a sensual Sri Lankan woman named Susanthika.

In between all this, he has twinges of conscience that try to awaken him to a sense of responsibility, to take a look at where he is going. He also has the occasional need to find spiritual solace by visiting Haridwar, and seeing the Ganga Aarti. The sight of the holy river comforts him, but he still keeps returning to his preferred mode of life.

The Company Of Women deals with love, lust and passion, and obsessive indulgence. Mohan Kumar, despite his faults, has some redeeming moments, like the affection and respect he shows for his father, and the occasional spiritual journeys he has. However, none of these help him rein in his lust.

In Chariots Of The Gods, Erich Von Daniken puts forth the hypothesis than many of the religious and technological events of early human civilization were directly influenced by ancient astronauts or aliens who visited the earth.


Moreover, Daniken claims we are the descendants of these ancient beings. He even cites several archaeological discoveries to prove his claim. Some of these discoveries include a huge spaceport in the Andes, computer astronomy from Egyptian and Incan ruins, and spaceflight navigation charts that are a thousand years old.


Daniken highlights the fact that several complex structures existed well before the technological progress to manufacture them had been accomplished. Some of these structures include the Stonehenge, the Nazca lines in Peru, and the pyramids of Egypt. Daniken claims that the existence of such artifacts can only be explained by the presence of a strong extraterrestrial influence.


He also explains that the traditions of most religions contain references to extraterrestrial presence. However, such references have not withstood the test of time, and have been misinterpreted and obscured by the passage of generations.


The book is backed by the author’s research into lost cities, ancient ruins, and numerous scientific facts. Some of the information presented in the book was later refuted by the author himself, when fresh evidence came to light.


Chariots Of The Gods was first published in 1968. A German documentary based on the book was released in 1970. It was directed by Harald Reinl. It even went on to earn an Oscar nomination. Paradox Entertainment held the rights to the movie adaptation of the book as of March 2009. A theme park based on the book is also in the works. The book was originally written in German. It has been translated into 32 languages since then.

The Fabric Of The Cosmos: Space, Time And The Texture Of Reality is a popular science book that tackles the big questions. It directly asks and attempts to answer questions such as what is reality and whether existence is possible without space and time, can we travel to the past, and what the limits of the universe are. The book from start to finish is an exploration of all that human beings have understood about the makeup of the universe. It is a journey which begins with Classical Physics and ends in the mysterious ten-dimensional M-Theory.

Brian Greene, in this book, has sought to make the non-intuitive, and sometimes counter-intuitive, mathematical concepts and theories accessible to the general audience, and the non-specialists. Concepts and ideas such as String Theory, Inflationary Cosmology, and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle are explained by drawing analogies to common experiences. Undertaking such a task, daunting as it is, stems from Brian’s passion for science and an ability to convert abstract scientific and mathematical ideas into poetic images.

Brian Greene also discusses teleportation, albeit in a more philosophical platform. He then explains in much greater depth the paradoxes of time travel. Additionally, he introduces his readers to his vision of life in a three-brane universe. Towards the end of the book, Greene surveys likely discoveries of the coming decades. The Fabric Of The Cosmos: Space, Time And The Texture Of Reality garnered extensive praise from newspapers and magazines. While Sunday Times recommended it as a must-read, the reviews of the book in Guardian and The New York Times were positive. The book spent half a year on The New York Times Bestseller list.

Marked by a deep personal touch and a classic blend of quick witted humour and detailed analysis of the author’s personal experiences in his personal and professional journey, Truth, Love and A Little Malice may be described as a controversial yet bold attempt by the writer to unabashedly bring to light his personal life experiences.

The book has Singh tracing his familial roots and talking about his family legacy. The book opens up and outgrows into further detailed images of the author’s meetings with political dignitaries. As he openly discusses those meetings with his unique wit, the reader is bound to be surprised yet amazed by his approach.

Being exposed to many post independent events in India, and closely attached politically as a journalist and columnist, the author reveals the deepest secrets of Indian political history in a very different from what we know it as. An example would be when he talks about the welcoming of Maneka Gandhi, as a daughter-in-law into the Gandhi family.
Truth, Love and A Little Malice marks the eventful journey of a bold writer from outside and from within and also reveals details about his first ever relationship and the intimacy surrounding it. The author does not for a minute bother to care about himself or his image and projects himself as a man who has made mistakes in his life.

Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships helps provide the readers with insights into what goes on during most of their social interactions. Berne tells the readers about transactional analysis, which can be utilized for interpreting social interactions. He also examines three roles, which is that of a Parent, Child, and Adult. He explains that a vast majority of behavioral issues stem from confusion of these roles. Berne makes use of an example to illustrate his proposition, which is an office setting where a parent-like boss begins to exercise his authority on his employees. This often results in rebellion, and child-like reactions from his employees.

He also explains that infants can slip into irreversible physical and mental decline due to lack of physical handling. Berne also goes on to throw light on certain studies that elucidate that temporary psychosis may occur due to sensory deprivation in adults. He explains that adults need to interact with individuals, as much as children need to, however, it may not always be possible to do so. This causes an individual to seek emotional strokes from others, which Berne describes as the fundamental unit of social action. He then uses this illustration to explain that exchanging strokes is a transaction, hence the term, Transactional Analysis.

Berne begins to tackle the issue of games played by individuals. He examines one of the most common statements people make, especially married couples, which is ‘If it weren’t for you’. He says that one partner often complains that the other often poses a roadblock in their attempts to do something they want. However, Berne throws light on the fact that individuals actually make such statements to throw the ball in someone else’s court, as a means of camouflaging their own weaknesses.

Quantum theory confronts us with strange paradoxes which refute the logic of conventional physics. At the subatomic level, one particle seems to know what the rest are doing, and according to Heisenberg’s ground-breaking “uncertainty principle”, there is a limit on how precisely nature can be observed by us. And yet, his theory is astoundingly accurate and extensively applied, explaining all of chemistry and most of physics. In this title, the puzzle of the wave-particle dual nature is discussed. Also described are the two questions raised against Bohr’s “Copenhagen Interpretation”, the famous “dead and alive cat”, and the EPR paradox, both of which remain uncertain yet.

The battle for Stalingrad became the focus of Hitler and Stalin's determination to win the gruesome, vicious war on the eastern front. The citizens of Stalingrad endured unimaginable hardship; the battle, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting in each room of each building, was brutally destructive to both armies. But the eventual victory of the Red Army, and the failure of Hitler's Operation Barbarossa, was the first defeat of Hitler's territorial ambitions in Europe, and the start of his decline.

An extraordinary story of tactical genius, civilian bravery, obsession, carnage and the nature of war itself, Stalingrad will act as a testament to the vital role of the soviet war effort.

Untouchable, published in 1935, deals with India’s caste system. Almost 80 years later, the problem still exists in contemporary India.

The story is about Bakha, the protagonist, who is a 18 year old sweeper and toilet cleaner. Bakha is a young and attractive man but is not accepted in the society because he belongs to the lowest of the lower class. His occupation of cleaning toilet makes him an outcast. He is often insulted by people, he is forced to beg for food, is not allowed to touch higher-class Hindus, cannot enter temples and must follows their orders. He tries to dress like Englishmen in hopes that this westernization would rid him of this burden of casteism, but his friends humiliate him for dressing like a sahib to try and be what he is not.

Untouchable describes a day of great difficulty for Bakha. He accidentally touches a upper-caste Hindu and gets slapped for having ‘polluted’ the man. Later on in the day, as he cleans a lady’s gutter, though she gives him food, she throws it on him. Unfortunately, Bakha sister gets molested by a priest on that very day. And Bakha gets blamed for injuring a young boy after a hockey match. As his day goes on, it gets from bad to worse. Finally, Untouchable tells us how Bakha’s father throws him out of the house. Bakha becomes frustrated and tries to find why he has to lead such a miserable and tragic life. He learns about Christianity and about the ways of Mahatma Gandhi. As the plot thickens, Barkha comes to an surprising conclusion.

Untouchable was inspired by the author’s own experiences. His aunt was treated as an outcast in his own family because she had food with a Muslim and later committed suicide. Anand himself had gotten injured after a hockey match and was carried home by a boy of the lower caste. Instead of thanking him, Anand’s mother had beaten up the boy. The book is written in lucid and simple language. This controversial piece of literature established the author as one of India’s leading English writers.

Aristotle’s The Metaphysics is a large philosophical collection of 14 books. Aristotle’s philosophy became the central branch for Western philosophical thought. Aristotle’s metaphysics grew out a reaction against Plato’s idealist doctrine. Aristotle was always concerned with natural phenomena. As a result, he wrote The Metaphysics which combined the rational and natural aspects of the universe.

Aristotle’s principal subject is “being understood as being”. His philosophy asserts that something can be asserted about a thing because it exists, and not because that thing has special traits.

The entire collection of texts, are centered around principal questions such as what it means to exist, what kinds of things exist in this world, and how can beings continue to exist when they undergo change in the world. The first six books in The Metaphysics deal with concepts such as the principal cause of things, how humans acquire wisdom, problems with philosophy, contradiction principles, definitions of key terms, and the hierarchy of sciences. Books 7, 8, and 9, examine concepts such as the essence of being, substance, and the nature of being a human being.

Aristotle also discusses at length, concepts such potentiality and actuality. Books 10 to 14, address the philosophy of Mathematics, unity, and provide further commentaries on the concept of god.

Aristotle’s The Metaphysics is considered to be one of the the greatest philosophical works. In Lawson-Tancred’s translation of The Metaphysics, readers will find an introductory essay that highlights the central themes of the philosophy of metaphysics.

This edition of The Metaphysics was published in 1998, by Penguin Classics.

About Aristotle

Aristotle was a Greek philosopher, and the founder of the metaphysical branch of philosophy.

He wrote several treatises during his lifetime. Some of these were Politics, Physics, The Art Of Rhetoric, The Nicomachean Ethics, and Poetics.

Aristotle was the Head at the Royal Academy in Macedon. He had many notable people under his tutelage such as Alexander, Cassander, and Ptolemy. Aristotle was interested in learning about all things natural. As a result, he wrote many treatises on topics such as astronomy, embryology, literature, and foreign customs. At one point in his life, Aristotle established his own school, known as Lyceum. He wrote on numerous topics like linguistics, music, physics, logic, biology, zoology, and on the government. Aristotle had been married twice, and had a son named Nicomachus. He died in 322 BC from natural causes.

Merging the life of a writer with the city of his childhood is a truly natural and exciting proposition. This becomes all the more true for an author who has come to symbolize the liberal face of Turkey. Istanbul: Memories And The City by Orhan Pamuk is a shimmering evocation of a city that is both intimate and panoramic. Written with a sense of melancholy, the author describes his life and how the change in the city has affected and shaped the manner in which he perceives the city. A personal memoir, the book also talks about prominent authors and writers who are in some way linked to the city.

Istanbul: Memories And The City is a book that revolves around a serious toddler who lives his life among the complicated lives of his family members. The entire household is ruled by the author’s grandmother, who though old and bedridden, controls the entire family but continuously mourns the fact that her sons are wasting the wealth and fortune of the family. Besides this, the author’s childhood is dominated by his uncle and aunts’ fights, and his parents’ collapsing marriage.

Split between his inner and outer reality, the author creates an alter ego and draws the readers into his dark house crammed with formal yet comfortable furniture, unused pianos, showcases with photographs and jewelry. The unloved and decayed city of Istanbul during the sixties and eighties is aptly described in the book. Applying his prose and skill through the book, the author weaves an intricate story about a city with all its customs and traditions and also provides some self-reflection. All in all, Istanbul: Memories And The City is a stunning novel that begins as the autobiography of the author and eventually becomes the story of an amazing and beautiful city.

About Orhan Pamuk

A Turkish novelist, academician and screenwriter, Orhan Pamuk is also the proud recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, 2006.

A major characteristic that is evident in Pamuk’s entire writing style is a loss of identity and confusion, that is a result of the conflict between the values of the East and West. Often troubling and alarming, the books have complex plots and characters. His works are also based on an admiration for various creative arts like literature and painting.

Other books by the author include The White Castle, My Name is Red, Snow, The Black Book, The Museum of Innocence, and The Silent House.

After graduating from the Institute of Journalism at the University of Istanbul, Pamuk became a full time writer. In March 1982, he married Aylin Türegün and they had a daughter named Rüya in 1991. The couple, however, divorced in 2001. Pamuk is currently in a relationship with Kiran Desai, a prominent author. One of the most prominent storytellers of Turkey, his books have sold more than eleven million copies around the world, and have been translated into almost 60 languages.",Istanbul: Memories of a City (Nobel Prize Winner's),Orhan Pamuk, , ,Penguin group,9780571218332, , ,Abroad,English

There have been innumerable questions that have been raised while talking about merging science and philosophy. Does God exist? Is science somewhere responsible for shaping the faith in God? Our culture and deep rooted values have conditioned us to believe in God, but some still question his existence. So, can one reach a common road between science and spirituality?

With the increasing philosophical scepticism and developments in science, man appeared to lose faith in God. But science itself has proved to be a false god, leaving in its wake a disillusioned and despondent mankind.

The author explains his personal journey that begins in a small town in Bengal, which was rife with turbulent periods that involved a famine and the chaos of the freedom struggle. His life journey, deeply influenced by his father’s and later by Mahatma Gandhi and Satyendranath Bose, is dealt with in detail, with a touch of spirituality.

The discoverer and pioneer of laser technology, thereafter facilitating the LASIK technique, Bhaumik explains, in his book, the reasons behind taking up research in spirituality and then takes a spiritual yet scientific approach to explain the existence and the strong presence of God in the universe.

The book can be seen as one that is divided into three parts. The first part deals with Bhaumik’s personal life amidst the extremities of poverty. The second part deals with his journey into the deep world of science and research, which were a turning point in his life and transformed him from a commoner to a multi-millionnaire. The third and final part is the author’s personal journey as he moves deep into the world of spirituality and begins to question certain realities.

Inspirational and deeply enriching, Code Name God attempts to provide the reader with a simple yet scientific approach to believe in God and to prove his existence.

The Communist Manifesto, which was originally titled as Manifesto of the Communist Party, is an influential political manuscript that lays out the Communist League’s aims and program. The Manifesto presents an analytical insight into the class struggle of the historical and contemporary era. The book also highlights the problems of capitalism.

The Communist Manifesto is divided into 4 sections. The first part is Bourgeois and Proletarians. It focuses on the Communist theory of the history and relation between the Bourgeois and the Proletarians. The next section, Proletarians and Communists, attempts to understand the relationship between Proletarians and Communists. The third part discusses the Socialist and Communist Literature and their flaws. The final part discusses the position of the Communists and its relation to the other opposition parties.

This edition of The Communist Manifesto has been edited by Gareth Stedman Jones. In this edition, he discusses The Reception of the Manifesto, The Communist League, The Spectre of Communism, and Engel’s and Marx’s contributions. Gareth Stedman Jones also discusses the The Young Hegelians including Hegel and Hegelianism, the Emergence of the Young Hegelians, and the Battle over Christianity. It also discuses the Political Economy, Communism, The True Natural History of Man, The Impact of Stirner, and the transformation from Republicanism to Communism.
Written after 4 years of collaboration between Engel and Marx, The Communist Manifesto was originally written in German and published on 21 February 1848. When it was originally published, it raised much controversy. Today, it is an important manifesto, a powerful historical document, and an important classical work.

Over the next forty years, Satyajit Ray came to be regarded as one of the world's finest film-makers ever. Today, more than a decade after his death, he continues to be India's most respected name in international film circles. Apart from his achievements as a director, Ray was also a prolific writer of novels, short stories, and essays on cinema. Speaking of Films brings together some of Ray's most memorable writings on film and film-making. With the masterly precision and clarity that characterize his films, Ray discusses a wide array of subjects: the structure and language of cinema with special reference to his adaptations of Tagore and Bibhuti Bhushan Bandopadhyay, the appropriate use of background music and dialogue in films, the relationship between a film-maker and a film critic, and important develoents in cinema like the advent of sound and colour. He also writes about his own experiences, the challenges of working with rank amateurs, and the innovations called for when making a film in the face of technological, financial and logistical constraints. In the process, Ray provides fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpses of the people who worked with him""the intricacies of getting Chhabi Biswas, who had no ear for music, to play a patron of classical music in Jalsaghar; the incredible memory of the seventy-five-year-old Chunibala Devi, Indir Thakrun of Pather Panchali, and her remarkable attention to details.

With his world thrown radically off-balance he can only hurtle towards tragedy. A classic in every sense, Chinua Achebe's stark, coolly ironic novel reshaped both Africa and world literature.
Introduction
Sometime in 1957, an advertisement appeared in the Spectator. The advertiser promised that, for a fee, ‘Authors’ Manuscripts [would be] Typed’. Several thousand miles away in Lagos, the bustling, seaside capital city of the soon-to-be independent British West African colony of Nigeria, an aspiring writer who happened to require the services of a typist came across the advertisement and promptly sent off his manuscript to England. The manuscript, named from a poem by the Irish poet W. B. Yeats, was entitled Things Fall Apart. Its author, the twenty-seven-year-old Chinua Achebe, was a producer with the Nigerian Broadcasting Service. For two years he had occupied his nights and his every free moment with the task of writing, and rigorously editing, the manuscript. It was a staggeringly ambitious work of invocation that was at once a celebration and an interrogation of the mores and culture of the South-eastern Igbo peoples, from whom Achebe descended, and an eloquent rebuttal of the all too casual denigration of Africans by, among others, European writers such as Joseph Conrad (whose quip, about the Congo setting of Heart of Darkness, that he was merely poking around in 'the dead cats of civilization’ has come to define Africa in the western imagination). 
For several months after posting his handwritten manuscript for typing, Achebe heard nothing from England. His polite but firm letters to the London address elicited no response. He was close to despair, convinced that it was lost. And it almost was lost but for the intervention of a friend, a British colleague at the Nigerian Broadcasting Service, who during her annual holiday in England took the time to track down the firm of typists. She returned to Nigeria with a typed copy of the manuscript. A year later, in 1958, William Heinemann published Things Fall Apart, the first title in what became the African Writers Series. The book received instant acclaim. It has since sold over ten million copies and has been translated into forty-five languages.
Chinua Achebe was born on I6 November 1930, in Ogidi, Eastern Nigeria. His great uncle, who brought up Achebe's father, had taken the highest-but-one title' in the clan, and was considered to be of such importance that when in the late nineteenth century Anglican missionaries came to Ogidi, and sought support for their work, they were shown to his compound. ‘For a short while he allowed them to operate from his compound,’ Achebe says in an essay written nearly a century later, ‘but after a few days he sent them packing again.’ Not because he found their theology offensive, but because he found their music alarming. ‘Your music is too sad to come from a man’s house,’ Achebe's great uncle told the missionaries, ‘my neighbours might think it was my funeral dirge.’ Achebe's father on the other hand had no such reservations about the new creed. He joined the missionaries, received an education from them, and became, in 1904, a teacher and catechist for the Anglican Church. Achebe grew up in a home where they sang hymns and read the Bible night and day. But he would often sneak across to his ‘heathen’ uncle's compound and partake in pagan festival’s of rice and stew. To his delight, he found in the food no flavour of idolatry. The converts to the new creed looked down on the non-Christians in the village, calling them 'the people of nothing.’ But Achebe did not suffer from an identity crisis over the two cultures contesting for his devotion. He lived at the crossroads of culture and although, as he grew up, he knew to reject, 'all that rubbish [about] the evil forces and irrational passions prowling through Africa's heart of darkness', he felt also that the crossroads did have a certain dangerous potency, ‘because a man might perish there wrestling with multiple-headed spirits, but also he might be lucky and return to his people with the boon of prophetic vision’. 
In 1953, at the age of twenty-three Achebe took a degree in English from the prestigious University College, Ibadan, becoming by definition a member of the select élite of educated West Africans who came into adulthood in the 1950s, and who were destined by history to inherit from the colonial powers the task of running the independent nation-states that came into being during the post-Second World War implosion of the empire 'where the sun never sets'. It was a highly educated generation, high achieving and boundless in its aspirations. Its confidence was an embodiment of the all-encompassing spirit of optimism that swept across Africa from desert to coast as emancipation approached. In the wake of the 'Hitler War’, Britain and France had found the task of rebuilding themselves impossible to reconcile with the bedevilled logistics of running empires of continually hostile and endlessly subversive subjects who clamoured for and were in many instances willing to die for — independence.
But the new dawn into which Achebe's generation woke was brief, a conjurer's trick. Even as independence approached, the African states which Winston Churchill had characterized as being nothing but ‘a mere geographical expression' were still afflicted with the debilitating psychosis of their nineteenth-century birth at the Berlin conference hosted by Bismarck. Here they were arbitrarily conjured into existence by an alliance of expansionist European powers who had come together to stake their claims to the treasure trove known as Africa, which they considered theirs to share, and to negotiate the ground rules for sharing it. They had gathered to partition 'the Dark Continent'. Thus began the so-called 'scramble for Africa', the age of empire. In partitioning Africa, they replaced the cartographer’s terra incognita with a map in which ancient foes were Balkanized and forced to live cheek-by-jowl, and whole nations were atomized and divided into states defined no longer by their shared culture, their common heritage, but by the European flags which now held sway over them. Bismarck's conference invented the topography of simmering hatred that would be later utilized by his African clones, that perennial infestation of little tyrants and tin-pot megalomaniacs spread all over Africa propagating internecine bloodbaths whose purpose is, and always has been, not only to unearth and annihilate all manifestations of dissent, but to divide and plunder.
Even as Kwame Nkrumah in the Gold Coast, Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya, Mrs Funmilayo Ransome Kuti in Nigeria and many others all over the continent dared to stare the…",Things Fall Apart (50th Anniversary Edition) (Award-Winning Authors' Books),Chinua Achebe, , ,Penguin group,9780141186887,"1st Edition,1994",200,Abroad,English

Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw aims at amusing the readers by describing Greg Heffley and his problems in life. The book traces his dislike for his father’s impositions, his disdain for Rodrick and the reluctance towards his mother’s demands of studying more.

The book covers the events in Greg’s life during the later half of seventh grade. It contains hilarious situations that Greg has to deal with such as the doing the laundry using laundry hoop gifted by Uncle Charlie. Greg is mortified when his father, impressed by a transformed nasty teenager, Lenwood Heath, who turned decent after attending a military school, decides to send Greg as well. Greg tries hard to distract his father from such terrifying prospects by talking incessantly about soccer and boy scouts. The book shows how an embarrassing incident leads to his father being grateful to him and allowing him to continue his studies in school.

The author expertly details Greg’s subtle and amusing encounters with his family and the lengths to which he goes to get out of troublesome situations.

The Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw is a popular comedy novel in the children’s books category. The book, along with the next one in the series, has been adapted into a film.

Winston Smith, the protagonist of Nineteen Eighty-Four, is a member of the ruling party in the fictional town of Oceania in London. The Party’s leader is Big Brother, who monitors the private and public lives of the people. Posters of ""Big Brother Is Watching You"" dominate Oceania. Each and every action of the people including Winston, are closely monitored. The novel explores totalitarianism and Orwell’s opposition to it.

Winston Smith works in the Ministry of Truth and edits articles for the Party. The Party dominates the entire nation, including areas like language and history. The Party also forces the implementation of a new language called ‘Newspeak’. Its main aim is to prevent political rebellion through elimination of all the words related to it. The Thought Police of the Party restrict any thoughts which are against its Party and any thoughts against the State are regarded as Thoughtcrime.

As the novel progresses, Winston is deeply frustrated by the many rules and rigid oppression of the Party. Winston soon begins to detest the Party which prohibits sex, free thought, or individuality. He purchases a diary illegally and begins to record his criminal thoughts. He also begins an affair with the beautiful and dark-haired Julia. The criminal activities of Winston bring him to the opposition party’s notice. Winston also comes across the mysterious O’Brien.

India 2020 is about to become a reality. Are we ready? In 1998, Dr Kalam and Y.S. Rajan published the now iconic India 2020, a vision document for the new millennium that charted how India could become one of the top five economic powers in the world by 2020. Sixteen years later, as the year 2020 approaches, it is time to take stock of how much India has achieved and what lies ahead. 

In many ways, India s growth story in the twenty-first century has been hamstrung by missed opportunities and slowdowns in project execution; but it has also been marked by new opportunities and emerging technologies that make faster and more inclusive growth viable. A renewed policy focus is now needed for agriculture, manufacturing, mining, the chemicals industry, health care and infrastructure to invigorate these sectors and boost economic growth, argue Kalam and Rajan. Alongside, education, job creation, emerging technologies, biodiversity, waste management, national security and the knowledge economy are some of the other vital areas that we need to build on as we look beyond 2020. 

India can still make it to the list of developed nations in a decade. Beyond 2020 provides an action plan for that transformation. (goodreads.com)",Beyond 2020 : A Vision for Tomorrows India,A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, , ,Penguin group,9780143426066,"1st Published,2014",281,India,English

He delves into the roots of fascism, and explores the US, the CIA and the government’s clandestine activities. His views on religious fundamentalism, global inequality and the foundation of racism form an interesting read for all, for not only does he touch upon these topics, but also on the ecological catastrophe that is approaching us all, and the myth of the Third World debt.

In The Politics Aristotle addresses the questions that lie at the heart of political science. How should society be ordered to ensure the happiness of the individual? Which forms of government are best and how should they be maintained? By analysing a range of city constitutions - oligarchies, democracies and tyrannies - he seeks to establish the strengths and weaknesses of each system, and to decide which are the most effective, in theory and in practice. A hugely significant work, which has influenced thinkers as diverse as Thomas Aquinas and Machiavelli, The Politics remains an outstanding commentary on fundamental political issues and concerns, and provides fascinating insights into the workings and attitudes of the Greek city-state.
The introductions by T. A. Sinclair and Trevor J. Saunders discuss the influence of The Politics on philosophers, its modern relevance and Aristotle's political beliefs.

Mohan Kumar discovered the pleasures of sex when he was studying in the US. While he is at Princeton University, he loses his virginity to a lovely black woman, Jessica Brown. They continue their relationship for some time. While still in the US, Mohan Kumar also has a relationship with an older woman, Yasmeen, a Pakistani. Having learnt more about lust than probably anything else, he returns to India, to where his father lives. He then gets married.

Mohan Kumar still continues to indulge his lustful passions. When his wife gives birth to a son, it opens up new opportunities for him. One of the nurses hired to take care of the child, Mary Joseph, becomes another of his willing partners.

His wife Sonu is neurotic, and her disposition is not improved by her husband’s constant affairs. Finally, they separate and get a divorce. Mohan’s ruling passion is still sex. He has numerous relationships with many different women, starting with the maid Dhanno. A successful and wealthy businessman now, Mohan starts advertising for the company of women. He has a succeeding line of companions, from an English Professor to a sensual Sri Lankan woman named Susanthika.

In between all this, he has twinges of conscience that try to awaken him to a sense of responsibility, to take a look at where he is going. He also has the occasional need to find spiritual solace by visiting Haridwar, and seeing the Ganga Aarti. The sight of the holy river comforts him, but he still keeps returning to his preferred mode of life.

The Company Of Women deals with love, lust and passion, and obsessive indulgence. Mohan Kumar, despite his faults, has some redeeming moments, like the affection and respect he shows for his father, and the occasional spiritual journeys he has. However, none of these help him rein in his lust.

In Chariots Of The Gods, Erich Von Daniken puts forth the hypothesis than many of the religious and technological events of early human civilization were directly influenced by ancient astronauts or aliens who visited the earth.


Moreover, Daniken claims we are the descendants of these ancient beings. He even cites several archaeological discoveries to prove his claim. Some of these discoveries include a huge spaceport in the Andes, computer astronomy from Egyptian and Incan ruins, and spaceflight navigation charts that are a thousand years old.


Daniken highlights the fact that several complex structures existed well before the technological progress to manufacture them had been accomplished. Some of these structures include the Stonehenge, the Nazca lines in Peru, and the pyramids of Egypt. Daniken claims that the existence of such artifacts can only be explained by the presence of a strong extraterrestrial influence.


He also explains that the traditions of most religions contain references to extraterrestrial presence. However, such references have not withstood the test of time, and have been misinterpreted and obscured by the passage of generations.


The book is backed by the author’s research into lost cities, ancient ruins, and numerous scientific facts. Some of the information presented in the book was later refuted by the author himself, when fresh evidence came to light.


Chariots Of The Gods was first published in 1968. A German documentary based on the book was released in 1970. It was directed by Harald Reinl. It even went on to earn an Oscar nomination. Paradox Entertainment held the rights to the movie adaptation of the book as of March 2009. A theme park based on the book is also in the works. The book was originally written in German. It has been translated into 32 languages since then.

Daniken was born Erich Anton Paul Von Daniken on April 14, 1935, in Zofingen, Aargau, Switzerland. He attended the Saint Michel Catholic school in Fribourg, Switzerland. While in school, he became fascinated with astronomy and the concept of flying saucers. Later, he was convicted on several charges of embezzlement and fraud and served time in prison.

The Fabric Of The Cosmos: Space, Time And The Texture Of Reality is a popular science book that tackles the big questions. It directly asks and attempts to answer questions such as what is reality and whether existence is possible without space and time, can we travel to the past, and what the limits of the universe are. The book from start to finish is an exploration of all that human beings have understood about the makeup of the universe. It is a journey which begins with Classical Physics and ends in the mysterious ten-dimensional M-Theory.

Brian Greene, in this book, has sought to make the non-intuitive, and sometimes counter-intuitive, mathematical concepts and theories accessible to the general audience, and the non-specialists. Concepts and ideas such as String Theory, Inflationary Cosmology, and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle are explained by drawing analogies to common experiences. Undertaking such a task, daunting as it is, stems from Brian’s passion for science and an ability to convert abstract scientific and mathematical ideas into poetic images.

Brian Greene also discusses teleportation, albeit in a more philosophical platform. He then explains in much greater depth the paradoxes of time travel. Additionally, he introduces his readers to his vision of life in a three-brane universe. Towards the end of the book, Greene surveys likely discoveries of the coming decades. The Fabric Of The Cosmos: Space, Time And The Texture Of Reality garnered extensive praise from newspapers and magazines. While Sunday Times recommended it as a must-read, the reviews of the book in Guardian and The New York Times were positive. The book spent half a year on The New York Times Bestseller list.

As he openly discusses those meetings with his unique wit, the reader is bound to be surprised yet amazed by his approach.

Being exposed to many post independent events in India, and closely attached politically as a journalist and columnist, the author reveals the deepest secrets of Indian political history in a very different from what we know it as. An example would be when he talks about the welcoming of Maneka Gandhi, as a daughter-in-law into the Gandhi family.
Truth, Love and A Little Malice marks the eventful journey of a bold writer from outside and from within and also reveals details about his first ever relationship and the intimacy surrounding it. The author does not for a minute bother to care about himself or his image and projects himself as a man who has made mistakes in his life.

Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships helps provide the readers with insights into what goes on during most of their social interactions. Berne tells the readers about transactional analysis, which can be utilized for interpreting social interactions. He also examines three roles, which is that of a Parent, Child, and Adult. He explains that a vast majority of behavioral issues stem from confusion of these roles. Berne makes use of an example to illustrate his proposition, which is an office setting where a parent-like boss begins to exercise his authority on his employees. This often results in rebellion, and child-like reactions from his employees.

He also explains that infants can slip into irreversible physical and mental decline due to lack of physical handling. Berne also goes on to throw light on certain studies that elucidate that temporary psychosis may occur due to sensory deprivation in adults. He explains that adults need to interact with individuals, as much as children need to, however, it may not always be possible to do so. This causes an individual to seek emotional strokes from others, which Berne describes as the fundamental unit of social action. He then uses this illustration to explain that exchanging strokes is a transaction, hence the term, Transactional Analysis.

Berne begins to tackle the issue of games played by individuals. He examines one of the most common statements people make, especially married couples, which is ‘If it weren’t for you’. He says that one partner often complains that the other often poses a roadblock in their attempts to do something they want. However, Berne throws light on the fact that individuals actually make such statements to throw the ball in someone else’s court, as a means of camouflaging their own weaknesses.

Quantum theory confronts us with strange paradoxes which refute the logic of conventional physics. At the subatomic level, one particle seems to know what the rest are doing, and according to Heisenberg’s ground-breaking “uncertainty principle”, there is a limit on how precisely nature can be observed by us. And yet, his theory is astoundingly accurate and extensively applied, explaining all of chemistry and most of physics. In this title, the puzzle of the wave-particle dual nature is discussed. Also described are the two questions raised against Bohr’s “Copenhagen Interpretation”, the famous “dead and alive cat”, and the EPR paradox, both of which remain uncertain yet.

The battle for Stalingrad became the focus of Hitler and Stalin's determination to win the gruesome, vicious war on the eastern front. The citizens of Stalingrad endured unimaginable hardship; the battle, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting in each room of each building, was brutally destructive to both armies. But the eventual victory of the Red Army, and the failure of Hitler's Operation Barbarossa, was the first defeat of Hitler's territorial ambitions in Europe, and the start of his decline.

An extraordinary story of tactical genius, civilian bravery, obsession, carnage and the nature of war itself, Stalingrad will act as a testament to the vital role of the soviet war effort.

Untouchable, published in 1935, deals with India’s caste system. Almost 80 years later, the problem still exists in contemporary India.

The story is about Bakha, the protagonist, who is a 18 year old sweeper and toilet cleaner. Bakha is a young and attractive man but is not accepted in the society because he belongs to the lowest of the lower class. His occupation of cleaning toilet makes him an outcast. He is often insulted by people, he is forced to beg for food, is not allowed to touch higher-class Hindus, cannot enter temples and must follows their orders. He tries to dress like Englishmen in hopes that this westernization would rid him of this burden of casteism, but his friends humiliate him for dressing like a sahib to try and be what he is not.

Untouchable describes a day of great difficulty for Bakha. He accidentally touches a upper-caste Hindu and gets slapped for having ‘polluted’ the man. Later on in the day, as he cleans a lady’s gutter, though she gives him food, she throws it on him. Unfortunately, Bakha sister gets molested by a priest on that very day. And Bakha gets blamed for injuring a young boy after a hockey match. As his day goes on, it gets from bad to worse. Finally, Untouchable tells us how Bakha’s father throws him out of the house. Bakha becomes frustrated and tries to find why he has to lead such a miserable and tragic life. He learns about Christianity and about the ways of Mahatma Gandhi. As the plot thickens, Barkha comes to an surprising conclusion.

Untouchable was inspired by the author’s own experiences. His aunt was treated as an outcast in his own family because she had food with a Muslim and later committed suicide. Anand himself had gotten injured after a hockey match and was carried home by a boy of the lower caste. Instead of thanking him, Anand’s mother had beaten up the boy. The book is written in lucid and simple language. This controversial piece of literature established the author as one of India’s leading English writers.

Aristotle’s The Metaphysics is a large philosophical collection of 14 books. Aristotle’s philosophy became the central branch for Western philosophical thought. Aristotle’s metaphysics grew out a reaction against Plato’s idealist doctrine. Aristotle was always concerned with natural phenomena. As a result, he wrote The Metaphysics which combined the rational and natural aspects of the universe.

Aristotle’s principal subject is “being understood as being”. His philosophy asserts that something can be asserted about a thing because it exists, and not because that thing has special traits.

The entire collection of texts, are centered around principal questions such as what it means to exist, what kinds of things exist in this world, and how can beings continue to exist when they undergo change in the world. The first six books in The Metaphysics deal with concepts such as the principal cause of things, how humans acquire wisdom, problems with philosophy, contradiction principles, definitions of key terms, and the hierarchy of sciences. Books 7, 8, and 9, examine concepts such as the essence of being, substance, and the nature of being a human being.

Aristotle also discusses at length, concepts such potentiality and actuality. Books 10 to 14, address the philosophy of Mathematics, unity, and provide further commentaries on the concept of god.

Aristotle’s The Metaphysics is considered to be one of the the greatest philosophical works. In Lawson-Tancred’s translation of The Metaphysics, readers will find an introductory essay that highlights the central themes of the philosophy of metaphysics.

This edition of The Metaphysics was published in 1998, by Penguin Classics.

About Aristotle

Aristotle was a Greek philosopher, and the founder of the metaphysical branch of philosophy.

He wrote several treatises during his lifetime. Some of these were Politics, Physics, The Art Of Rhetoric, The Nicomachean Ethics, and Poetics.

Aristotle was the Head at the Royal Academy in Macedon. He had many notable people under his tutelage such as Alexander, Cassander, and Ptolemy. Aristotle was interested in learning about all things natural. As a result, he wrote many treatises on topics such as astronomy, embryology, literature, and foreign customs. At one point in his life, Aristotle established his own school, known as Lyceum. He wrote on numerous topics like linguistics, music, physics, logic, biology, zoology, and on the government. Aristotle had been married twice, and had a son named Nicomachus. He died in 322 BC from natural causes. The Aristotle Mountains, a group of mountains in Graham Land, Antarctica were named in his honor.",Metaphysics,Aristotle, , ,Penguin group,9780140446197,1st Edition,528,Abroad,English

Merging the life of a writer with the city of his childhood is a truly natural and exciting proposition. This becomes all the more true for an author who has come to symbolize the liberal face of Turkey. Istanbul: Memories And The City by Orhan Pamuk is a shimmering evocation of a city that is both intimate and panoramic. Written with a sense of melancholy, the author describes his life and how the change in the city has affected and shaped the manner in which he perceives the city. A personal memoir, the book also talks about prominent authors and writers who are in some way linked to the city.

Istanbul: Memories And The City is a book that revolves around a serious toddler who lives his life among the complicated lives of his family members. The entire household is ruled by the author’s grandmother, who though old and bedridden, controls the entire family but continuously mourns the fact that her sons are wasting the wealth and fortune of the family. Besides this, the author’s childhood is dominated by his uncle and aunts’ fights, and his parents’ collapsing marriage.

Split between his inner and outer reality, the author creates an alter ego and draws the readers into his dark house crammed with formal yet comfortable furniture, unused pianos, showcases with photographs and jewelry. The unloved and decayed city of Istanbul during the sixties and eighties is aptly described in the book. Applying his prose and skill through the book, the author weaves an intricate story about a city with all its customs and traditions and also provides some self-reflection. All in all, Istanbul: Memories And The City is a stunning novel that begins as the autobiography of the author and eventually becomes the story of an amazing and beautiful city.

About Orhan Pamuk

A Turkish novelist, academician and screenwriter, Orhan Pamuk is also the proud recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, 2006.

A major characteristic that is evident in Pamuk’s entire writing style is a loss of identity and confusion, that is a result of the conflict between the values of the East and West. Often troubling and alarming, the books have complex plots and characters. His works are also based on an admiration for various creative arts like literature and painting.

Other books by the author include The White Castle, My Name is Red, Snow, The Black Book, The Museum of Innocence, and The Silent House.

After graduating from the Institute of Journalism at the University of Istanbul, Pamuk became a full time writer. In March 1982, he married Aylin Türegün and they had a daughter named Rüya in 1991. The couple, however, divorced in 2001. Pamuk is currently in a relationship with Kiran Desai, a prominent author. One of the most prominent storytellers of Turkey, his books have sold more than eleven million copies around the world, and have been translated into almost 60 languages.",Istanbul: Memories of a City (Nobel Prize Winner's),Orhan Pamuk, , ,Penguin group,9780571218332, , ,Abroad,English

There have been innumerable questions that have been raised while talking about merging science and philosophy. Does God exist? Is science somewhere responsible for shaping the faith in God? Our culture and deep rooted values have conditioned us to believe in God, but some still question his existence. So, can one reach a common road between science and spirituality?

With the increasing philosophical scepticism and developments in science, man appeared to lose faith in God. But science itself has proved to be a false god, leaving in its wake a disillusioned and despondent mankind.

The author explains his personal journey that begins in a small town in Bengal, which was rife with turbulent periods that involved a famine and the chaos of the freedom struggle. His life journey, deeply influenced by his father’s and later by Mahatma Gandhi and Satyendranath Bose, is dealt with in detail, with a touch of spirituality.

The discoverer and pioneer of laser technology, thereafter facilitating the LASIK technique, Bhaumik explains, in his book, the reasons behind taking up research in spirituality and then takes a spiritual yet scientific approach to explain the existence and the strong presence of God in the universe.

The book can be seen as one that is divided into three parts. The first part deals with Bhaumik’s personal life amidst the extremities of poverty. The second part deals with his journey into the deep world of science and research, which were a turning point in his life and transformed him from a commoner to a multi-millionnaire. The third and final part is the author’s personal journey as he moves deep into the world of spirituality and begins to question certain realities.

Inspirational and deeply enriching, Code Name God attempts to provide the reader with a simple yet scientific approach to believe in God and to prove his existence.

Today, more than a decade after his death, he continues to be India's most respected name in international film circles. Apart from his achievements as a director, Ray was also a prolific writer of novels, short stories, and essays on cinema. Speaking of Films brings together some of Ray's most memorable writings on film and film-making. With the masterly precision and clarity that characterize his films, Ray discusses a wide array of subjects: the structure and language of cinema with special reference to his adaptations of Tagore and Bibhuti Bhushan Bandopadhyay, the appropriate use of background music and dialogue in films, the relationship between a film-maker and a film critic, and important develoents in cinema like the advent of sound and colour. He also writes about his own experiences, the challenges of working with rank amateurs, and the innovations called for when making a film in the face of technological, financial and logistical constraints. In the process, Ray provides fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpses of the people who worked with him""the intricacies of getting Chhabi Biswas, who had no ear for music, to play a patron of classical music in Jalsaghar; the incredible memory of the seventy-five-year-old Chunibala Devi, Indir Thakrun of Pather Panchali, and her remarkable attention to details. This first-ever translation of Bishay Chalachitra, a seminal collection of essays on cinema, Speaking of Films retains the lucidity and simplicity that is a hallmark of Ray's writing, and gives an invaluable insight into the mind of a genius.",Speaking Of Films,Satyajit Ray, , ,Penguin group,9780144000265,"1st Published,2005",220,India,English

But when he accidentally kills a clansman, things begin to fall apart. Then Okonkwo returns from exile to find missionaries and colonial governors have arrived in the village. With his world thrown radically off-balance he can only hurtle towards tragedy. A classic in every sense, Chinua Achebe's stark, coolly ironic novel reshaped both Africa and world literature.
Introduction
Sometime in 1957, an advertisement appeared in the Spectator. The advertiser promised that, for a fee, ‘Authors’ Manuscripts [would be] Typed’. Several thousand miles away in Lagos, the bustling, seaside capital city of the soon-to-be independent British West African colony of Nigeria, an aspiring writer who happened to require the services of a typist came across the advertisement and promptly sent off his manuscript to England. The manuscript, named from a poem by the Irish poet W. B. Yeats, was entitled Things Fall Apart. Its author, the twenty-seven-year-old Chinua Achebe, was a producer with the Nigerian Broadcasting Service. For two years he had occupied his nights and his every free moment with the task of writing, and rigorously editing, the manuscript. It was a staggeringly ambitious work of invocation that was at once a celebration and an interrogation of the mores and culture of the South-eastern Igbo peoples, from whom Achebe descended, and an eloquent rebuttal of the all too casual denigration of Africans by, among others, European writers such as Joseph Conrad (whose quip, about the Congo setting of Heart of Darkness, that he was merely poking around in 'the dead cats of civilization’ has come to define Africa in the western imagination). 
For several months after posting his handwritten manuscript for typing, Achebe heard nothing from England. His polite but firm letters to the London address elicited no response. He was close to despair, convinced that it was lost. And it almost was lost but for the intervention of a friend, a British colleague at the Nigerian Broadcasting Service, who during her annual holiday in England took the time to track down the firm of typists. She returned to Nigeria with a typed copy of the manuscript. A year later, in 1958, William Heinemann published Things Fall Apart, the first title in what became the African Writers Series. The book received instant acclaim. It has since sold over ten million copies and has been translated into forty-five languages.
Chinua Achebe was born on I6 November 1930, in Ogidi, Eastern Nigeria. His great uncle, who brought up Achebe's father, had taken the highest-but-one title' in the clan, and was considered to be of such importance that when in the late nineteenth century Anglican missionaries came to Ogidi, and sought support for their work, they were shown to his compound. ‘For a short while he allowed them to operate from his compound,’ Achebe says in an essay written nearly a century later, ‘but after a few days he sent them packing again.’ Not because he found their theology offensive, but because he found their music alarming. ‘Your music is too sad to come from a man’s house,’ Achebe's great uncle told the missionaries, ‘my neighbours might think it was my funeral dirge.’ Achebe's father on the other hand had no such reservations about the new creed. He joined the missionaries, received an education from them, and became, in 1904, a teacher and catechist for the Anglican Church. Achebe grew up in a home where they sang hymns and read the Bible night and day. But he would often sneak across to his ‘heathen’ uncle's compound and partake in pagan festival’s of rice and stew. To his delight, he found in the food no flavour of idolatry. The converts to the new creed looked down on the non-Christians in the village, calling them 'the people of nothing.’ But Achebe did not suffer from an identity crisis over the two cultures contesting for his devotion. He lived at the crossroads of culture and although, as he grew up, he knew to reject, 'all that rubbish [about] the evil forces and irrational passions prowling through Africa's heart of darkness', he felt also that the crossroads did have a certain dangerous potency, ‘because a man might perish there wrestling with multiple-headed spirits, but also he might be lucky and return to his people with the boon of prophetic vision’. 
In 1953, at the age of twenty-three Achebe took a degree in English from the prestigious University College, Ibadan, becoming by definition a member of the select élite of educated West Africans who came into adulthood in the 1950s, and who were destined by history to inherit from the colonial powers the task of running the independent nation-states that came into being during the post-Second World War implosion of the empire 'where the sun never sets'. It was a highly educated generation, high achieving and boundless in its aspirations. Its confidence was an embodiment of the all-encompassing spirit of optimism that swept across Africa from desert to coast as emancipation approached. In the wake of the 'Hitler War’, Britain and France had found the task of rebuilding themselves impossible to reconcile with the bedevilled logistics of running empires of continually hostile and endlessly subversive subjects who clamoured for and were in many instances willing to die for — independence.
But the new dawn into which Achebe's generation woke was brief, a conjurer's trick. Even as independence approached, the African states which Winston Churchill had characterized as being nothing but ‘a mere geographical expression' were still afflicted with the debilitating psychosis of their nineteenth-century birth at the Berlin conference hosted by Bismarck. Here they were arbitrarily conjured into existence by an alliance of expansionist European powers who had come together to stake their claims to the treasure trove known as Africa, which they considered theirs to share, and to negotiate the ground rules for sharing it. They had gathered to partition 'the Dark Continent'. Thus began the so-called 'scramble for Africa', the age of empire. In partitioning Africa, they replaced the cartographer’s terra incognita with a map in which ancient foes were Balkanized and forced to live cheek-by-jowl, and whole nations were atomized and divided into states defined no longer by their shared culture, their common heritage, but by the European flags which now held sway over them. Bismarck's conference invented the topography of simmering hatred that would be later utilized by his African clones, that perennial infestation of little tyrants and tin-pot megalomaniacs spread all over Africa propagating internecine bloodbaths whose purpose is, and always has been, not only to unearth and annihilate all manifestations of dissent, but to divide and plunder.
Even as Kwame Nkrumah in the Gold Coast, Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya, Mrs Funmilayo Ransome Kuti in Nigeria and many others all over the continent dared to stare the…",Things Fall Apart (50th Anniversary Edition) (Award-Winning Authors' Books),Chinua Achebe, , ,Penguin group,9780141186887,"1st Edition,1994",200,Abroad,English

Winston Smith, the protagonist of Nineteen Eighty-Four, is a member of the ruling party in the fictional town of Oceania in London. The Party’s leader is Big Brother, who monitors the private and public lives of the people. Posters of ""Big Brother Is Watching You"" dominate Oceania. Each and every action of the people including Winston, are closely monitored. The novel explores totalitarianism and Orwell’s opposition to it.

Winston Smith works in the Ministry of Truth and edits articles for the Party. The Party dominates the entire nation, including areas like language and history. The Party also forces the implementation of a new language called ‘Newspeak’. Its main aim is to prevent political rebellion through elimination of all the words related to it. The Thought Police of the Party restrict any thoughts which are against its Party and any thoughts against the State are regarded as Thoughtcrime.

As the novel progresses, Winston is deeply frustrated by the many rules and rigid oppression of the Party. Winston soon begins to detest the Party which prohibits sex, free thought, or individuality. He purchases a diary illegally and begins to record his criminal thoughts. He also begins an affair with the beautiful and dark-haired Julia. The criminal activities of Winston bring him to the opposition party’s notice. Winston also comes across the mysterious O’Brien. Winston thinks O’Brien is a secret member of the legendary group called the Brotherhood which aims to overthrow the ruling Party.

Will Winston ever be able to escape from Big Brother? How can one reason and think in a nation where everything is fabricated? Who is O'Brien and what does he want from Winston?

Published in 1949, Nineteen Eighty-Four is among Orwell’s best loved works. The novel exerts much influence among its readers and continues to be highly popular even to this day. It has been adapted to the television, radio, film, and theatre formats.

India 2020 is about to become a reality. Are we ready? In 1998, Dr Kalam and Y.S. Rajan published the now iconic India 2020, a vision document for the new millennium that charted how India could become one of the top five economic powers in the world by 2020. Sixteen years later, as the year 2020 approaches, it is time to take stock of how much India has achieved and what lies ahead. 

In many ways, India s growth story in the twenty-first century has been hamstrung by missed opportunities and slowdowns in project execution; but it has also been marked by new opportunities and emerging technologies that make faster and more inclusive growth viable. A renewed policy focus is now needed for agriculture, manufacturing, mining, the chemicals industry, health care and infrastructure to invigorate these sectors and boost economic growth, argue Kalam and Rajan. Alongside, education, job creation, emerging technologies, biodiversity, waste management, national security and the knowledge economy are some of the other vital areas that we need to build on as we look beyond 2020.

Noam Chomsky is best placed to speak about geopolitics. His experience and voice carry weight and resonate throughout the halls of the government. This collection brings readers some of his speeches and interviews, speaking about myriad topics such as US Foreign Policy, the new global economy, food and Third World economic miracles. He delves into the roots of fascism, and explores the US, the CIA and the government’s clandestine activities. His views on religious fundamentalism, global inequality and the foundation of racism form an interesting read for all, for not only does he touch upon these topics, but also on the ecological catastrophe that is approaching us all, and the myth of the Third World debt.

In The Politics Aristotle addresses the questions that lie at the heart of political science. How should society be ordered to ensure the happiness of the individual? Which forms of government are best and how should they be maintained? By analysing a range of city constitutions - oligarchies, democracies and tyrannies - he seeks to establish the strengths and weaknesses of each system, and to decide which are the most effective, in theory and in practice. A hugely significant work, which has influenced thinkers as diverse as Thomas Aquinas and Machiavelli, The Politics remains an outstanding commentary on fundamental political issues and concerns, and provides fascinating insights into the workings and attitudes of the Greek city-state.
The introductions by T. A. Sinclair and Trevor J. Saunders discuss the influence of The Politics on philosophers, its modern relevance and Aristotle's political beliefs.

Mohan Kumar discovered the pleasures of sex when he was studying in the US. While he is at Princeton University, he loses his virginity to a lovely black woman, Jessica Brown. They continue their relationship for some time. While still in the US, Mohan Kumar also has a relationship with an older woman, Yasmeen, a Pakistani. Having learnt more about lust than probably anything else, he returns to India, to where his father lives. He then gets married.

Mohan Kumar still continues to indulge his lustful passions. When his wife gives birth to a son, it opens up new opportunities for him. One of the nurses hired to take care of the child, Mary Joseph, becomes another of his willing partners.

His wife Sonu is neurotic, and her disposition is not improved by her husband’s constant affairs. Finally, they separate and get a divorce. Mohan’s ruling passion is still sex. He has numerous relationships with many different women, starting with the maid Dhanno. A successful and wealthy businessman now, Mohan starts advertising for the company of women. He has a succeeding line of companions, from an English Professor to a sensual Sri Lankan woman named Susanthika.

In between all this, he has twinges of conscience that try to awaken him to a sense of responsibility, to take a look at where he is going. He also has the occasional need to find spiritual solace by visiting Haridwar, and seeing the Ganga Aarti. The sight of the holy river comforts him, but he still keeps returning to his preferred mode of life.

The Company Of Women deals with love, lust and passion, and obsessive indulgence. Mohan Kumar, despite his faults, has some redeeming moments, like the affection and respect he shows for his father, and the occasional spiritual journeys he has. However, none of these help him rein in his lust.

In Chariots Of The Gods, Erich Von Daniken puts forth the hypothesis than many of the religious and technological events of early human civilization were directly influenced by ancient astronauts or aliens who visited the earth.


Moreover, Daniken claims we are the descendants of these ancient beings. He even cites several archaeological discoveries to prove his claim. Some of these discoveries include a huge spaceport in the Andes, computer astronomy from Egyptian and Incan ruins, and spaceflight navigation charts that are a thousand years old.


Daniken highlights the fact that several complex structures existed well before the technological progress to manufacture them had been accomplished. Some of these structures include the Stonehenge, the Nazca lines in Peru, and the pyramids of Egypt. Daniken claims that the existence of such artifacts can only be explained by the presence of a strong extraterrestrial influence.


He also explains that the traditions of most religions contain references to extraterrestrial presence. However, such references have not withstood the test of time, and have been misinterpreted and obscured by the passage of generations.


The book is backed by the author’s research into lost cities, ancient ruins, and numerous scientific facts. Some of the information presented in the book was later refuted by the author himself, when fresh evidence came to light.


Chariots Of The Gods was first published in 1968. A German documentary based on the book was released in 1970. It was directed by Harald Reinl. It even went on to earn an Oscar nomination. Paradox Entertainment held the rights to the movie adaptation of the book as of March 2009. A theme park based on the book is also in the works. The book was originally written in German. It has been translated into 32 languages since then.

Daniken was born Erich Anton Paul Von Daniken on April 14, 1935, in Zofingen, Aargau, Switzerland. He attended the Saint Michel Catholic school in Fribourg, Switzerland. While in school, he became fascinated with astronomy and the concept of flying saucers. Later, he was convicted on several charges of embezzlement and fraud and served time in prison.

The Fabric Of The Cosmos: Space, Time And The Texture Of Reality is a popular science book that tackles the big questions. It directly asks and attempts to answer questions such as what is reality and whether existence is possible without space and time, can we travel to the past, and what the limits of the universe are. The book from start to finish is an exploration of all that human beings have understood about the makeup of the universe. It is a journey which begins with Classical Physics and ends in the mysterious ten-dimensional M-Theory.

Brian Greene, in this book, has sought to make the non-intuitive, and sometimes counter-intuitive, mathematical concepts and theories accessible to the general audience, and the non-specialists. Concepts and ideas such as String Theory, Inflationary Cosmology, and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle are explained by drawing analogies to common experiences. Undertaking such a task, daunting as it is, stems from Brian’s passion for science and an ability to convert abstract scientific and mathematical ideas into poetic images.

Brian Greene also discusses teleportation, albeit in a more philosophical platform. He then explains in much greater depth the paradoxes of time travel. Additionally, he introduces his readers to his vision of life in a three-brane universe. Towards the end of the book, Greene surveys likely discoveries of the coming decades. The Fabric Of The Cosmos: Space, Time And The Texture Of Reality garnered extensive praise from newspapers and magazines. While Sunday Times recommended it as a must-read, the reviews of the book in Guardian and The New York Times were positive. The book spent half a year on The New York Times Bestseller list.

Marked by a deep personal touch and a classic blend of quick witted humour and detailed analysis of the author’s personal experiences in his personal and professional journey, Truth, Love and A Little Malice may be described as a controversial yet bold attempt by the writer to unabashedly bring to light his personal life experiences.

The book has Singh tracing his familial roots and talking about his family legacy. The book opens up and outgrows into further detailed images of the author’s meetings with political dignitaries. As he openly discusses those meetings with his unique wit, the reader is bound to be surprised yet amazed by his approach.

Being exposed to many post independent events in India, and closely attached politically as a journalist and columnist, the author reveals the deepest secrets of Indian political history in a very different from what we know it as. An example would be when he talks about the welcoming of Maneka Gandhi, as a daughter-in-law into the Gandhi family.
Truth, Love and A Little Malice marks the eventful journey of a bold writer from outside and from within and also reveals details about his first ever relationship and the intimacy surrounding it. The author does not for a minute bother to care about himself or his image and projects himself as a man who has made mistakes in his life.

Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships helps provide the readers with insights into what goes on during most of their social interactions. Berne tells the readers about transactional analysis, which can be utilized for interpreting social interactions. He also examines three roles, which is that of a Parent, Child, and Adult. He explains that a vast majority of behavioral issues stem from confusion of these roles. Berne makes use of an example to illustrate his proposition, which is an office setting where a parent-like boss begins to exercise his authority on his employees. This often results in rebellion, and child-like reactions from his employees.

He also explains that infants can slip into irreversible physical and mental decline due to lack of physical handling. Berne also goes on to throw light on certain studies that elucidate that temporary psychosis may occur due to sensory deprivation in adults. He explains that adults need to interact with individuals, as much as children need to, however, it may not always be possible to do so. This causes an individual to seek emotional strokes from others, which Berne describes as the fundamental unit of social action. He then uses this illustration to explain that exchanging strokes is a transaction, hence the term, Transactional Analysis.

Berne begins to tackle the issue of games played by individuals. He examines one of the most common statements people make, especially married couples, which is ‘If it weren’t for you’. He says that one partner often complains that the other often poses a roadblock in their attempts to do something they want. However, Berne throws light on the fact that individuals actually make such statements to throw the ball in someone else’s court, as a means of camouflaging their own weaknesses.

Quantum theory confronts us with strange paradoxes which refute the logic of conventional physics. At the subatomic level, one particle seems to know what the rest are doing, and according to Heisenberg’s ground-breaking “uncertainty principle”, there is a limit on how precisely nature can be observed by us. And yet, his theory is astoundingly accurate and extensively applied, explaining all of chemistry and most of physics. In this title, the puzzle of the wave-particle dual nature is discussed. Also described are the two questions raised against Bohr’s “Copenhagen Interpretation”, the famous “dead and alive cat”, and the EPR paradox, both of which remain uncertain yet.

The battle for Stalingrad became the focus of Hitler and Stalin's determination to win the gruesome, vicious war on the eastern front. The citizens of Stalingrad endured unimaginable hardship; the battle, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting in each room of each building, was brutally destructive to both armies. But the eventual victory of the Red Army, and the failure of Hitler's Operation Barbarossa, was the first defeat of Hitler's territorial ambitions in Europe, and the start of his decline.

An extraordinary story of tactical genius, civilian bravery, obsession, carnage and the nature of war itself, Stalingrad will act as a testament to the vital role of the soviet war effort.

Untouchable, published in 1935, deals with India’s caste system. Almost 80 years later, the problem still exists in contemporary India.

The story is about Bakha, the protagonist, who is a 18 year old sweeper and toilet cleaner. Bakha is a young and attractive man but is not accepted in the society because he belongs to the lowest of the lower class. His occupation of cleaning toilet makes him an outcast. He is often insulted by people, he is forced to beg for food, is not allowed to touch higher-class Hindus, cannot enter temples and must follows their orders. He tries to dress like Englishmen in hopes that this westernization would rid him of this burden of casteism, but his friends humiliate him for dressing like a sahib to try and be what he is not.

Untouchable describes a day of great difficulty for Bakha. He accidentally touches a upper-caste Hindu and gets slapped for having ‘polluted’ the man. Later on in the day, as he cleans a lady’s gutter, though she gives him food, she throws it on him. Unfortunately, Bakha sister gets molested by a priest on that very day. And Bakha gets blamed for injuring a young boy after a hockey match. As his day goes on, it gets from bad to worse. Finally, Untouchable tells us how Bakha’s father throws him out of the house. Bakha becomes frustrated and tries to find why he has to lead such a miserable and tragic life. He learns about Christianity and about the ways of Mahatma Gandhi. As the plot thickens, Barkha comes to an surprising conclusion.

Untouchable was inspired by the author’s own experiences. His aunt was treated as an outcast in his own family because she had food with a Muslim and later committed suicide. Anand himself had gotten injured after a hockey match and was carried home by a boy of the lower caste. Instead of thanking him, Anand’s mother had beaten up the boy. The book is written in lucid and simple language. This controversial piece of literature established the author as one of India’s leading English writers.

Aristotle’s The Metaphysics is a large philosophical collection of 14 books. Aristotle’s philosophy became the central branch for Western philosophical thought. Aristotle’s metaphysics grew out a reaction against Plato’s idealist doctrine. Aristotle was always concerned with natural phenomena. As a result, he wrote The Metaphysics which combined the rational and natural aspects of the universe.

Aristotle’s principal subject is “being understood as being”. His philosophy asserts that something can be asserted about a thing because it exists, and not because that thing has special traits.

The entire collection of texts, are centered around principal questions such as what it means to exist, what kinds of things exist in this world, and how can beings continue to exist when they undergo change in the world. The first six books in The Metaphysics deal with concepts such as the principal cause of things, how humans acquire wisdom, problems with philosophy, contradiction principles, definitions of key terms, and the hierarchy of sciences. Books 7, 8, and 9, examine concepts such as the essence of being, substance, and the nature of being a human being.

Aristotle also discusses at length, concepts such potentiality and actuality. Books 10 to 14, address the philosophy of Mathematics, unity, and provide further commentaries on the concept of god.

Aristotle’s The Metaphysics is considered to be one of the the greatest philosophical works. In Lawson-Tancred’s translation of The Metaphysics, readers will find an introductory essay that highlights the central themes of the philosophy of metaphysics.

This edition of The Metaphysics was published in 1998, by Penguin Classics.

About Aristotle

Aristotle was a Greek philosopher, and the founder of the metaphysical branch of philosophy.

He wrote several treatises during his lifetime. Some of these were Politics, Physics, The Art Of Rhetoric, The Nicomachean Ethics, and Poetics.

Aristotle was the Head at the Royal Academy in Macedon. He had many notable people under his tutelage such as Alexander, Cassander, and Ptolemy. Aristotle was interested in learning about all things natural. As a result, he wrote many treatises on topics such as astronomy, embryology, literature, and foreign customs. At one point in his life, Aristotle established his own school, known as Lyceum. He wrote on numerous topics like linguistics, music, physics, logic, biology, zoology, and on the government. Aristotle had been married twice, and had a son named Nicomachus. He died in 322 BC from natural causes.

Merging the life of a writer with the city of his childhood is a truly natural and exciting proposition. This becomes all the more true for an author who has come to symbolize the liberal face of Turkey. Istanbul: Memories And The City by Orhan Pamuk is a shimmering evocation of a city that is both intimate and panoramic. Written with a sense of melancholy, the author describes his life and how the change in the city has affected and shaped the manner in which he perceives the city. A personal memoir, the book also talks about prominent authors and writers who are in some way linked to the city.

Istanbul: Memories And The City is a book that revolves around a serious toddler who lives his life among the complicated lives of his family members. The entire household is ruled by the author’s grandmother, who though old and bedridden, controls the entire family but continuously mourns the fact that her sons are wasting the wealth and fortune of the family. Besides this, the author’s childhood is dominated by his uncle and aunts’ fights, and his parents’ collapsing marriage.

Split between his inner and outer reality, the author creates an alter ego and draws the readers into his dark house crammed with formal yet comfortable furniture, unused pianos, showcases with photographs and jewelry. The unloved and decayed city of Istanbul during the sixties and eighties is aptly described in the book. Applying his prose and skill through the book, the author weaves an intricate story about a city with all its customs and traditions and also provides some self-reflection. All in all, Istanbul: Memories And The City is a stunning novel that begins as the autobiography of the author and eventually becomes the story of an amazing and beautiful city.

About Orhan Pamuk

A Turkish novelist, academician and screenwriter, Orhan Pamuk is also the proud recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, 2006.

A major characteristic that is evident in Pamuk’s entire writing style is a loss of identity and confusion, that is a result of the conflict between the values of the East and West. Often troubling and alarming, the books have complex plots and characters. His works are also based on an admiration for various creative arts like literature and painting.

Other books by the author include The White Castle, My Name is Red, Snow, The Black Book, The Museum of Innocence, and The Silent House.

After graduating from the Institute of Journalism at the University of Istanbul, Pamuk became a full time writer. In March 1982, he married Aylin Türegün and they had a daughter named Rüya in 1991. The couple, however, divorced in 2001. Pamuk is currently in a relationship with Kiran Desai, a prominent author. One of the most prominent storytellers of Turkey, his books have sold more than eleven million copies around the world, and have been translated into almost 60 languages.",Istanbul: Memories of a City (Nobel Prize Winner's),Orhan Pamuk, , ,Penguin group,9780571218332, , ,Abroad,English

Our culture and deep rooted values have conditioned us to believe in God, but some still question his existence. So, can one reach a common road between science and spirituality?

With the increasing philosophical scepticism and developments in science, man appeared to lose faith in God. But science itself has proved to be a false god, leaving in its wake a disillusioned and despondent mankind.

The author explains his personal journey that begins in a small town in Bengal, which was rife with turbulent periods that involved a famine and the chaos of the freedom struggle. His life journey, deeply influenced by his father’s and later by Mahatma Gandhi and Satyendranath Bose, is dealt with in detail, with a touch of spirituality.

The discoverer and pioneer of laser technology, thereafter facilitating the LASIK technique, Bhaumik explains, in his book, the reasons behind taking up research in spirituality and then takes a spiritual yet scientific approach to explain the existence and the strong presence of God in the universe.

The book can be seen as one that is divided into three parts. The first part deals with Bhaumik’s personal life amidst the extremities of poverty. The second part deals with his journey into the deep world of science and research, which were a turning point in his life and transformed him from a commoner to a multi-millionnaire. The third and final part is the author’s personal journey as he moves deep into the world of spirituality and begins to question certain realities.

Inspirational and deeply enriching, Code Name God attempts to provide the reader with a simple yet scientific approach to believe in God and to prove his existence.
