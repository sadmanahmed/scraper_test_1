Eagerly anticipated by millions of programmers, Java SE 8 is the most important Java update in many years. The addition of lambda expressions (closures) and streams represents the biggest change to Java programming since the introduction of generics and annotations.

Now, with Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient, internationally renowned Java author Cay S. Horstmann concisely introduces Java 8's most valuable new features (plus a few Java 7 innovations that haven't gotten the attention they deserve). If you're an experienced Java programmer, Horstmann's practical insights and sample code will help you quickly take advantage of these and other Java language and platform improvements. This indispensable guide includes
• Coverage of using lambda expressions (closures) to write computation ""snippets"" that can be passed to utility
functions
• The brand-new streams API that makes Java collections far more flexible and efficient
• Major updates to concurrent programming that make use of lambda expressions (filter/map/reduce) and that
provide dramatic performance improvements for shared counters and hash tables
• A full chapter with advice on how you can put lambda expressions to work in your own programs
• Coverage of the long-awaited introduction of a well-designed date/time/calendar library (JSR 310) • A concise introduction to JavaFX, which is positioned to replace Swing Guls, and to the Nashorn Javascript engine
• A thorough discussion of many small library changes that make Java programming more productive and enjoyable
This is the first title to cover all of these highly anticipated improvements and is invaluable for anyone who wants to write tomorrow's most robust, efficient, and secure Java code.

Cay S. Horstmann is the author of Scala for the Impatient (Addison-Wesley, 2012), is principal author of Core Java"", Volumes I and II, Ninth Edition (Prentice Hall, 2013), and has written a dozen other books for professional programmers and computer science students.

The book offers a crisp introduction to options markets and futures.


Since the study of derivatives requires plenty of mathematics and because all the readers might not have a solid mathematical background, the authors have tried to strike a balance between essential and non-essential mathematics and present many numerical problems for better and thorough understanding.


The book is tailored for beginners and no prior knowledge of options markets and futures is required.


The seventh edition of the book is new and improved and contains a variety of newly introduced topics. For instance, it discusses a lot of issues pertaining to the Indian market. Other topics covered include credit derivatives, swaps, Greek letters, binomial trees, volatility smiles, and interest rate futures.


The CD that comes with this edition is an added bonus and lets the users create useful applications in a few simple steps.


The numerical examples and practice questions help in easily understanding the concepts that have been explained. The minimal text in the book offers extensive knowledge and information in the form of theory. The book also features real life accounts and sound logical reasoning.

Eagerly anticipated by millions of programmers, Java SE 8 is the most important Java update in many years. The addition of lambda expressions (closures) and streams represents the biggest change to Java programming since the introduction of generics and annotations.

Now, with Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient, internationally renowned Java author Cay S. Horstmann concisely introduces Java 8's most valuable new features (plus a few Java 7 innovations that haven't gotten the attention they deserve). If you're an experienced Java programmer, Horstmann's practical insights and sample code will help you quickly take advantage of these and other Java language and platform improvements. This indispensable guide includes
• Coverage of using lambda expressions (closures) to write computation ""snippets"" that can be passed to utility
functions
• The brand-new streams API that makes Java collections far more flexible and efficient
• Major updates to concurrent programming that make use of lambda expressions (filter/map/reduce) and that
provide dramatic performance improvements for shared counters and hash tables
• A full chapter with advice on how you can put lambda expressions to work in your own programs
• Coverage of the long-awaited introduction of a well-designed date/time/calendar library (JSR 310) • A concise introduction to JavaFX, which is positioned to replace Swing Guls, and to the Nashorn Javascript engine
• A thorough discussion of many small library changes that make Java programming more productive and enjoyable
This is the first title to cover all of these highly anticipated improvements and is invaluable for anyone who wants to write tomorrow's most robust, efficient, and secure Java code.

Cay S. Horstmann is the author of Scala for the Impatient (Addison-Wesley, 2012), is principal author of Core Java"", Volumes I and II, Ninth Edition (Prentice Hall, 2013), and has written a dozen other books for professional programmers and computer science students.

The book offers a crisp introduction to options markets and futures.


Since the study of derivatives requires plenty of mathematics and because all the readers might not have a solid mathematical background, the authors have tried to strike a balance between essential and non-essential mathematics and present many numerical problems for better and thorough understanding.


The book is tailored for beginners and no prior knowledge of options markets and futures is required.


The seventh edition of the book is new and improved and contains a variety of newly introduced topics. For instance, it discusses a lot of issues pertaining to the Indian market. Other topics covered include credit derivatives, swaps, Greek letters, binomial trees, volatility smiles, and interest rate futures.


The CD that comes with this edition is an added bonus and lets the users create useful applications in a few simple steps.


The numerical examples and practice questions help in easily understanding the concepts that have been explained. The minimal text in the book offers extensive knowledge and information in the form of theory. The book also features real life accounts and sound logical reasoning.

Eagerly anticipated by millions of programmers, Java SE 8 is the most important Java update in many years. The addition of lambda expressions (closures) and streams represents the biggest change to Java programming since the introduction of generics and annotations.

Now, with Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient, internationally renowned Java author Cay S. Horstmann concisely introduces Java 8's most valuable new features (plus a few Java 7 innovations that haven't gotten the attention they deserve). If you're an experienced Java programmer, Horstmann's practical insights and sample code will help you quickly take advantage of these and other Java language and platform improvements. This indispensable guide includes
• Coverage of using lambda expressions (closures) to write computation ""snippets"" that can be passed to utility
functions
• The brand-new streams API that makes Java collections far more flexible and efficient
• Major updates to concurrent programming that make use of lambda expressions (filter/map/reduce) and that
provide dramatic performance improvements for shared counters and hash tables
• A full chapter with advice on how you can put lambda expressions to work in your own programs
• Coverage of the long-awaited introduction of a well-designed date/time/calendar library (JSR 310) • A concise introduction to JavaFX, which is positioned to replace Swing Guls, and to the Nashorn Javascript engine
• A thorough discussion of many small library changes that make Java programming more productive and enjoyable
This is the first title to cover all of these highly anticipated improvements and is invaluable for anyone who wants to write tomorrow's most robust, efficient, and secure Java code.

Cay S. Horstmann is the author of Scala for the Impatient (Addison-Wesley, 2012), is principal author of Core Java"", Volumes I and II, Ninth Edition (Prentice Hall, 2013), and has written a dozen other books for professional programmers and computer science students.

The book offers a crisp introduction to options markets and futures.


Since the study of derivatives requires plenty of mathematics and because all the readers might not have a solid mathematical background, the authors have tried to strike a balance between essential and non-essential mathematics and present many numerical problems for better and thorough understanding.


The book is tailored for beginners and no prior knowledge of options markets and futures is required.


The seventh edition of the book is new and improved and contains a variety of newly introduced topics. For instance, it discusses a lot of issues pertaining to the Indian market. Other topics covered include credit derivatives, swaps, Greek letters, binomial trees, volatility smiles, and interest rate futures.


The CD that comes with this edition is an added bonus and lets the users create useful applications in a few simple steps.


The numerical examples and practice questions help in easily understanding the concepts that have been explained. The minimal text in the book offers extensive knowledge and information in the form of theory. The book also features real life accounts and sound logical reasoning.


Options, Futures And Other Derivatives (With CD) was published in 2009 by Pearson.

Eagerly anticipated by millions of programmers, Java SE 8 is the most important Java update in many years. The addition of lambda expressions (closures) and streams represents the biggest change to Java programming since the introduction of generics and annotations.

Now, with Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient, internationally renowned Java author Cay S. Horstmann concisely introduces Java 8's most valuable new features (plus a few Java 7 innovations that haven't gotten the attention they deserve). If you're an experienced Java programmer, Horstmann's practical insights and sample code will help you quickly take advantage of these and other Java language and platform improvements. This indispensable guide includes
• Coverage of using lambda expressions (closures) to write computation ""snippets"" that can be passed to utility
functions
• The brand-new streams API that makes Java collections far more flexible and efficient
• Major updates to concurrent programming that make use of lambda expressions (filter/map/reduce) and that
provide dramatic performance improvements for shared counters and hash tables
• A full chapter with advice on how you can put lambda expressions to work in your own programs
• Coverage of the long-awaited introduction of a well-designed date/time/calendar library (JSR 310) • A concise introduction to JavaFX, which is positioned to replace Swing Guls, and to the Nashorn Javascript engine
• A thorough discussion of many small library changes that make Java programming more productive and enjoyable
This is the first title to cover all of these highly anticipated improvements and is invaluable for anyone who wants to write tomorrow's most robust, efficient, and secure Java code.

Cay S. Horstmann is the author of Scala for the Impatient (Addison-Wesley, 2012), is principal author of Core Java"", Volumes I and II, Ninth Edition (Prentice Hall, 2013), and has written a dozen other books for professional programmers and computer science students. He is a professor of computer science at San Jose State University and is a Java Champion.",Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient,Cay S.

The book offers a crisp introduction to options markets and futures.


Since the study of derivatives requires plenty of mathematics and because all the readers might not have a solid mathematical background, the authors have tried to strike a balance between essential and non-essential mathematics and present many numerical problems for better and thorough understanding.


The book is tailored for beginners and no prior knowledge of options markets and futures is required.


The seventh edition of the book is new and improved and contains a variety of newly introduced topics. For instance, it discusses a lot of issues pertaining to the Indian market. Other topics covered include credit derivatives, swaps, Greek letters, binomial trees, volatility smiles, and interest rate futures.


The CD that comes with this edition is an added bonus and lets the users create useful applications in a few simple steps.


The numerical examples and practice questions help in easily understanding the concepts that have been explained. The minimal text in the book offers extensive knowledge and information in the form of theory. The book also features real life accounts and sound logical reasoning.


Options, Futures And Other Derivatives (With CD) was published in 2009 by Pearson.

Eagerly anticipated by millions of programmers, Java SE 8 is the most important Java update in many years. The addition of lambda expressions (closures) and streams represents the biggest change to Java programming since the introduction of generics and annotations.

Now, with Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient, internationally renowned Java author Cay S. Horstmann concisely introduces Java 8's most valuable new features (plus a few Java 7 innovations that haven't gotten the attention they deserve). If you're an experienced Java programmer, Horstmann's practical insights and sample code will help you quickly take advantage of these and other Java language and platform improvements. This indispensable guide includes
• Coverage of using lambda expressions (closures) to write computation ""snippets"" that can be passed to utility
functions
• The brand-new streams API that makes Java collections far more flexible and efficient
• Major updates to concurrent programming that make use of lambda expressions (filter/map/reduce) and that
provide dramatic performance improvements for shared counters and hash tables
• A full chapter with advice on how you can put lambda expressions to work in your own programs
• Coverage of the long-awaited introduction of a well-designed date/time/calendar library (JSR 310) • A concise introduction to JavaFX, which is positioned to replace Swing Guls, and to the Nashorn Javascript engine
• A thorough discussion of many small library changes that make Java programming more productive and enjoyable
This is the first title to cover all of these highly anticipated improvements and is invaluable for anyone who wants to write tomorrow's most robust, efficient, and secure Java code.

Cay S. Horstmann is the author of Scala for the Impatient (Addison-Wesley, 2012), is principal author of Core Java"", Volumes I and II, Ninth Edition (Prentice Hall, 2013), and has written a dozen other books for professional programmers and computer science students. He is a professor of computer science at San Jose State University and is a Java Champion.",Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient,Cay S.

The book offers a crisp introduction to options markets and futures.


Since the study of derivatives requires plenty of mathematics and because all the readers might not have a solid mathematical background, the authors have tried to strike a balance between essential and non-essential mathematics and present many numerical problems for better and thorough understanding.


The book is tailored for beginners and no prior knowledge of options markets and futures is required.


The seventh edition of the book is new and improved and contains a variety of newly introduced topics. For instance, it discusses a lot of issues pertaining to the Indian market. Other topics covered include credit derivatives, swaps, Greek letters, binomial trees, volatility smiles, and interest rate futures.


The CD that comes with this edition is an added bonus and lets the users create useful applications in a few simple steps.


The numerical examples and practice questions help in easily understanding the concepts that have been explained. The minimal text in the book offers extensive knowledge and information in the form of theory. The book also features real life accounts and sound logical reasoning.


Options, Futures And Other Derivatives (With CD) was published in 2009 by Pearson.

Eagerly anticipated by millions of programmers, Java SE 8 is the most important Java update in many years. The addition of lambda expressions (closures) and streams represents the biggest change to Java programming since the introduction of generics and annotations.

Now, with Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient, internationally renowned Java author Cay S. Horstmann concisely introduces Java 8's most valuable new features (plus a few Java 7 innovations that haven't gotten the attention they deserve). If you're an experienced Java programmer, Horstmann's practical insights and sample code will help you quickly take advantage of these and other Java language and platform improvements. This indispensable guide includes
• Coverage of using lambda expressions (closures) to write computation ""snippets"" that can be passed to utility
functions
• The brand-new streams API that makes Java collections far more flexible and efficient
• Major updates to concurrent programming that make use of lambda expressions (filter/map/reduce) and that
provide dramatic performance improvements for shared counters and hash tables
• A full chapter with advice on how you can put lambda expressions to work in your own programs
• Coverage of the long-awaited introduction of a well-designed date/time/calendar library (JSR 310) • A concise introduction to JavaFX, which is positioned to replace Swing Guls, and to the Nashorn Javascript engine
• A thorough discussion of many small library changes that make Java programming more productive and enjoyable
This is the first title to cover all of these highly anticipated improvements and is invaluable for anyone who wants to write tomorrow's most robust, efficient, and secure Java code.

Cay S. Horstmann is the author of Scala for the Impatient (Addison-Wesley, 2012), is principal author of Core Java"", Volumes I and II, Ninth Edition (Prentice Hall, 2013), and has written a dozen other books for professional programmers and computer science students. He is a professor of computer science at San Jose State University and is a Java Champion.",Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient,Cay S.

The book offers a crisp introduction to options markets and futures.


Since the study of derivatives requires plenty of mathematics and because all the readers might not have a solid mathematical background, the authors have tried to strike a balance between essential and non-essential mathematics and present many numerical problems for better and thorough understanding.


The book is tailored for beginners and no prior knowledge of options markets and futures is required.


The seventh edition of the book is new and improved and contains a variety of newly introduced topics. For instance, it discusses a lot of issues pertaining to the Indian market. Other topics covered include credit derivatives, swaps, Greek letters, binomial trees, volatility smiles, and interest rate futures.


The CD that comes with this edition is an added bonus and lets the users create useful applications in a few simple steps.


The numerical examples and practice questions help in easily understanding the concepts that have been explained. The minimal text in the book offers extensive knowledge and information in the form of theory. The book also features real life accounts and sound logical reasoning.


Options, Futures And Other Derivatives (With CD) was published in 2009 by Pearson.

Eagerly anticipated by millions of programmers, Java SE 8 is the most important Java update in many years. The addition of lambda expressions (closures) and streams represents the biggest change to Java programming since the introduction of generics and annotations.

Now, with Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient, internationally renowned Java author Cay S. Horstmann concisely introduces Java 8's most valuable new features (plus a few Java 7 innovations that haven't gotten the attention they deserve). If you're an experienced Java programmer, Horstmann's practical insights and sample code will help you quickly take advantage of these and other Java language and platform improvements. This indispensable guide includes
• Coverage of using lambda expressions (closures) to write computation ""snippets"" that can be passed to utility
functions
• The brand-new streams API that makes Java collections far more flexible and efficient
• Major updates to concurrent programming that make use of lambda expressions (filter/map/reduce) and that
provide dramatic performance improvements for shared counters and hash tables
• A full chapter with advice on how you can put lambda expressions to work in your own programs
• Coverage of the long-awaited introduction of a well-designed date/time/calendar library (JSR 310) • A concise introduction to JavaFX, which is positioned to replace Swing Guls, and to the Nashorn Javascript engine
• A thorough discussion of many small library changes that make Java programming more productive and enjoyable
This is the first title to cover all of these highly anticipated improvements and is invaluable for anyone who wants to write tomorrow's most robust, efficient, and secure Java code.

Cay S. Horstmann is the author of Scala for the Impatient (Addison-Wesley, 2012), is principal author of Core Java"", Volumes I and II, Ninth Edition (Prentice Hall, 2013), and has written a dozen other books for professional programmers and computer science students.

The book offers a crisp introduction to options markets and futures.


Since the study of derivatives requires plenty of mathematics and because all the readers might not have a solid mathematical background, the authors have tried to strike a balance between essential and non-essential mathematics and present many numerical problems for better and thorough understanding.


The book is tailored for beginners and no prior knowledge of options markets and futures is required.


The seventh edition of the book is new and improved and contains a variety of newly introduced topics. For instance, it discusses a lot of issues pertaining to the Indian market. Other topics covered include credit derivatives, swaps, Greek letters, binomial trees, volatility smiles, and interest rate futures.


The CD that comes with this edition is an added bonus and lets the users create useful applications in a few simple steps.


The numerical examples and practice questions help in easily understanding the concepts that have been explained. The minimal text in the book offers extensive knowledge and information in the form of theory. The book also features real life accounts and sound logical reasoning.

Eagerly anticipated by millions of programmers, Java SE 8 is the most important Java update in many years. The addition of lambda expressions (closures) and streams represents the biggest change to Java programming since the introduction of generics and annotations.

Now, with Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient, internationally renowned Java author Cay S. Horstmann concisely introduces Java 8's most valuable new features (plus a few Java 7 innovations that haven't gotten the attention they deserve). If you're an experienced Java programmer, Horstmann's practical insights and sample code will help you quickly take advantage of these and other Java language and platform improvements. This indispensable guide includes
• Coverage of using lambda expressions (closures) to write computation ""snippets"" that can be passed to utility
functions
• The brand-new streams API that makes Java collections far more flexible and efficient
• Major updates to concurrent programming that make use of lambda expressions (filter/map/reduce) and that
provide dramatic performance improvements for shared counters and hash tables
• A full chapter with advice on how you can put lambda expressions to work in your own programs
• Coverage of the long-awaited introduction of a well-designed date/time/calendar library (JSR 310) • A concise introduction to JavaFX, which is positioned to replace Swing Guls, and to the Nashorn Javascript engine
• A thorough discussion of many small library changes that make Java programming more productive and enjoyable
This is the first title to cover all of these highly anticipated improvements and is invaluable for anyone who wants to write tomorrow's most robust, efficient, and secure Java code.

Cay S. Horstmann is the author of Scala for the Impatient (Addison-Wesley, 2012), is principal author of Core Java"", Volumes I and II, Ninth Edition (Prentice Hall, 2013), and has written a dozen other books for professional programmers and computer science students.

The book offers a crisp introduction to options markets and futures.


Since the study of derivatives requires plenty of mathematics and because all the readers might not have a solid mathematical background, the authors have tried to strike a balance between essential and non-essential mathematics and present many numerical problems for better and thorough understanding.


The book is tailored for beginners and no prior knowledge of options markets and futures is required.


The seventh edition of the book is new and improved and contains a variety of newly introduced topics. For instance, it discusses a lot of issues pertaining to the Indian market. Other topics covered include credit derivatives, swaps, Greek letters, binomial trees, volatility smiles, and interest rate futures.


The CD that comes with this edition is an added bonus and lets the users create useful applications in a few simple steps.


The numerical examples and practice questions help in easily understanding the concepts that have been explained. The minimal text in the book offers extensive knowledge and information in the form of theory. The book also features real life accounts and sound logical reasoning.

Eagerly anticipated by millions of programmers, Java SE 8 is the most important Java update in many years. The addition of lambda expressions (closures) and streams represents the biggest change to Java programming since the introduction of generics and annotations.

Now, with Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient, internationally renowned Java author Cay S. Horstmann concisely introduces Java 8's most valuable new features (plus a few Java 7 innovations that haven't gotten the attention they deserve). If you're an experienced Java programmer, Horstmann's practical insights and sample code will help you quickly take advantage of these and other Java language and platform improvements. This indispensable guide includes
• Coverage of using lambda expressions (closures) to write computation ""snippets"" that can be passed to utility
functions
• The brand-new streams API that makes Java collections far more flexible and efficient
• Major updates to concurrent programming that make use of lambda expressions (filter/map/reduce) and that
provide dramatic performance improvements for shared counters and hash tables
• A full chapter with advice on how you can put lambda expressions to work in your own programs
• Coverage of the long-awaited introduction of a well-designed date/time/calendar library (JSR 310) • A concise introduction to JavaFX, which is positioned to replace Swing Guls, and to the Nashorn Javascript engine
• A thorough discussion of many small library changes that make Java programming more productive and enjoyable
This is the first title to cover all of these highly anticipated improvements and is invaluable for anyone who wants to write tomorrow's most robust, efficient, and secure Java code.

Cay S. Horstmann is the author of Scala for the Impatient (Addison-Wesley, 2012), is principal author of Core Java"", Volumes I and II, Ninth Edition (Prentice Hall, 2013), and has written a dozen other books for professional programmers and computer science students.

The book offers a crisp introduction to options markets and futures.


Since the study of derivatives requires plenty of mathematics and because all the readers might not have a solid mathematical background, the authors have tried to strike a balance between essential and non-essential mathematics and present many numerical problems for better and thorough understanding.


The book is tailored for beginners and no prior knowledge of options markets and futures is required.


The seventh edition of the book is new and improved and contains a variety of newly introduced topics. For instance, it discusses a lot of issues pertaining to the Indian market. Other topics covered include credit derivatives, swaps, Greek letters, binomial trees, volatility smiles, and interest rate futures.


The CD that comes with this edition is an added bonus and lets the users create useful applications in a few simple steps.


The numerical examples and practice questions help in easily understanding the concepts that have been explained. The minimal text in the book offers extensive knowledge and information in the form of theory. The book also features real life accounts and sound logical reasoning.

In fact, entrepreneurial development is a key to economic development. Similarily, small-scale industries (SSIs)/small business enterprises (SBEs) today constitute a very important segment in the Indian economy and are also closely linked to entrepreneurial and economic development. However, the process of liberalisation and economic reforms, since 1991, while creating tremendous opportunities for the growth of entrepreneurship and SSIs, have thrown up new challenges of building competitive strengths, introducing technology upgradation and quality improvement, and increasing productivity. Divided into two parts, namely, Entrepreneurship Development, and Management of Small Business Enterprise, this book dwells into these issues and offers valuable inputs to the students of the subject as well as to the professionals and budding entrepreneurs.",Entrepreneurship Development and Small Business Enterprise,Poornima M.

Eagerly anticipated by millions of programmers, Java SE 8 is the most important Java update in many years. The addition of lambda expressions (closures) and streams represents the biggest change to Java programming since the introduction of generics and annotations.

Now, with Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient, internationally renowned Java author Cay S. Horstmann concisely introduces Java 8's most valuable new features (plus a few Java 7 innovations that haven't gotten the attention they deserve). If you're an experienced Java programmer, Horstmann's practical insights and sample code will help you quickly take advantage of these and other Java language and platform improvements. This indispensable guide includes
• Coverage of using lambda expressions (closures) to write computation ""snippets"" that can be passed to utility
functions
• The brand-new streams API that makes Java collections far more flexible and efficient
• Major updates to concurrent programming that make use of lambda expressions (filter/map/reduce) and that
provide dramatic performance improvements for shared counters and hash tables
• A full chapter with advice on how you can put lambda expressions to work in your own programs
• Coverage of the long-awaited introduction of a well-designed date/time/calendar library (JSR 310) • A concise introduction to JavaFX, which is positioned to replace Swing Guls, and to the Nashorn Javascript engine
• A thorough discussion of many small library changes that make Java programming more productive and enjoyable
This is the first title to cover all of these highly anticipated improvements and is invaluable for anyone who wants to write tomorrow's most robust, efficient, and secure Java code.

Cay S. Horstmann is the author of Scala for the Impatient (Addison-Wesley, 2012), is principal author of Core Java"", Volumes I and II, Ninth Edition (Prentice Hall, 2013), and has written a dozen other books for professional programmers and computer science students.

The book offers a crisp introduction to options markets and futures.


Since the study of derivatives requires plenty of mathematics and because all the readers might not have a solid mathematical background, the authors have tried to strike a balance between essential and non-essential mathematics and present many numerical problems for better and thorough understanding.


The book is tailored for beginners and no prior knowledge of options markets and futures is required.


The seventh edition of the book is new and improved and contains a variety of newly introduced topics. For instance, it discusses a lot of issues pertaining to the Indian market. Other topics covered include credit derivatives, swaps, Greek letters, binomial trees, volatility smiles, and interest rate futures.


The CD that comes with this edition is an added bonus and lets the users create useful applications in a few simple steps.


The numerical examples and practice questions help in easily understanding the concepts that have been explained. The minimal text in the book offers extensive knowledge and information in the form of theory. The book also features real life accounts and sound logical reasoning.

Eagerly anticipated by millions of programmers, Java SE 8 is the most important Java update in many years. The addition of lambda expressions (closures) and streams represents the biggest change to Java programming since the introduction of generics and annotations.

Now, with Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient, internationally renowned Java author Cay S. Horstmann concisely introduces Java 8's most valuable new features (plus a few Java 7 innovations that haven't gotten the attention they deserve). If you're an experienced Java programmer, Horstmann's practical insights and sample code will help you quickly take advantage of these and other Java language and platform improvements. This indispensable guide includes
• Coverage of using lambda expressions (closures) to write computation ""snippets"" that can be passed to utility
functions
• The brand-new streams API that makes Java collections far more flexible and efficient
• Major updates to concurrent programming that make use of lambda expressions (filter/map/reduce) and that
provide dramatic performance improvements for shared counters and hash tables
• A full chapter with advice on how you can put lambda expressions to work in your own programs
• Coverage of the long-awaited introduction of a well-designed date/time/calendar library (JSR 310) • A concise introduction to JavaFX, which is positioned to replace Swing Guls, and to the Nashorn Javascript engine
• A thorough discussion of many small library changes that make Java programming more productive and enjoyable
This is the first title to cover all of these highly anticipated improvements and is invaluable for anyone who wants to write tomorrow's most robust, efficient, and secure Java code.

Cay S. Horstmann is the author of Scala for the Impatient (Addison-Wesley, 2012), is principal author of Core Java"", Volumes I and II, Ninth Edition (Prentice Hall, 2013), and has written a dozen other books for professional programmers and computer science students. He is a professor of computer science at San Jose State University and is a Java Champion.",Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient,Cay S.

The book offers a crisp introduction to options markets and futures.


Since the study of derivatives requires plenty of mathematics and because all the readers might not have a solid mathematical background, the authors have tried to strike a balance between essential and non-essential mathematics and present many numerical problems for better and thorough understanding.


The book is tailored for beginners and no prior knowledge of options markets and futures is required.


The seventh edition of the book is new and improved and contains a variety of newly introduced topics. For instance, it discusses a lot of issues pertaining to the Indian market. Other topics covered include credit derivatives, swaps, Greek letters, binomial trees, volatility smiles, and interest rate futures.


The CD that comes with this edition is an added bonus and lets the users create useful applications in a few simple steps.


The numerical examples and practice questions help in easily understanding the concepts that have been explained. The minimal text in the book offers extensive knowledge and information in the form of theory. The book also features real life accounts and sound logical reasoning.


Options, Futures And Other Derivatives (With CD) was published in 2009 by Pearson.

Eagerly anticipated by millions of programmers, Java SE 8 is the most important Java update in many years. The addition of lambda expressions (closures) and streams represents the biggest change to Java programming since the introduction of generics and annotations.

Now, with Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient, internationally renowned Java author Cay S. Horstmann concisely introduces Java 8's most valuable new features (plus a few Java 7 innovations that haven't gotten the attention they deserve). If you're an experienced Java programmer, Horstmann's practical insights and sample code will help you quickly take advantage of these and other Java language and platform improvements. This indispensable guide includes
• Coverage of using lambda expressions (closures) to write computation ""snippets"" that can be passed to utility
functions
• The brand-new streams API that makes Java collections far more flexible and efficient
• Major updates to concurrent programming that make use of lambda expressions (filter/map/reduce) and that
provide dramatic performance improvements for shared counters and hash tables
• A full chapter with advice on how you can put lambda expressions to work in your own programs
• Coverage of the long-awaited introduction of a well-designed date/time/calendar library (JSR 310) • A concise introduction to JavaFX, which is positioned to replace Swing Guls, and to the Nashorn Javascript engine
• A thorough discussion of many small library changes that make Java programming more productive and enjoyable
This is the first title to cover all of these highly anticipated improvements and is invaluable for anyone who wants to write tomorrow's most robust, efficient, and secure Java code.

Cay S. Horstmann is the author of Scala for the Impatient (Addison-Wesley, 2012), is principal author of Core Java"", Volumes I and II, Ninth Edition (Prentice Hall, 2013), and has written a dozen other books for professional programmers and computer science students. He is a professor of computer science at San Jose State University and is a Java Champion.",Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient,Cay S.

The book offers a crisp introduction to options markets and futures.


Since the study of derivatives requires plenty of mathematics and because all the readers might not have a solid mathematical background, the authors have tried to strike a balance between essential and non-essential mathematics and present many numerical problems for better and thorough understanding.


The book is tailored for beginners and no prior knowledge of options markets and futures is required.


The seventh edition of the book is new and improved and contains a variety of newly introduced topics. For instance, it discusses a lot of issues pertaining to the Indian market. Other topics covered include credit derivatives, swaps, Greek letters, binomial trees, volatility smiles, and interest rate futures.


The CD that comes with this edition is an added bonus and lets the users create useful applications in a few simple steps.


The numerical examples and practice questions help in easily understanding the concepts that have been explained. The minimal text in the book offers extensive knowledge and information in the form of theory. The book also features real life accounts and sound logical reasoning.


Options, Futures And Other Derivatives (With CD) was published in 2009 by Pearson.

Eagerly anticipated by millions of programmers, Java SE 8 is the most important Java update in many years. The addition of lambda expressions (closures) and streams represents the biggest change to Java programming since the introduction of generics and annotations.

Now, with Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient, internationally renowned Java author Cay S. Horstmann concisely introduces Java 8's most valuable new features (plus a few Java 7 innovations that haven't gotten the attention they deserve). If you're an experienced Java programmer, Horstmann's practical insights and sample code will help you quickly take advantage of these and other Java language and platform improvements. This indispensable guide includes
• Coverage of using lambda expressions (closures) to write computation ""snippets"" that can be passed to utility
functions
• The brand-new streams API that makes Java collections far more flexible and efficient
• Major updates to concurrent programming that make use of lambda expressions (filter/map/reduce) and that
provide dramatic performance improvements for shared counters and hash tables
• A full chapter with advice on how you can put lambda expressions to work in your own programs
• Coverage of the long-awaited introduction of a well-designed date/time/calendar library (JSR 310) • A concise introduction to JavaFX, which is positioned to replace Swing Guls, and to the Nashorn Javascript engine
• A thorough discussion of many small library changes that make Java programming more productive and enjoyable
This is the first title to cover all of these highly anticipated improvements and is invaluable for anyone who wants to write tomorrow's most robust, efficient, and secure Java code.

Cay S. Horstmann is the author of Scala for the Impatient (Addison-Wesley, 2012), is principal author of Core Java"", Volumes I and II, Ninth Edition (Prentice Hall, 2013), and has written a dozen other books for professional programmers and computer science students. He is a professor of computer science at San Jose State University and is a Java Champion.",Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient,Cay S.

The book offers a crisp introduction to options markets and futures.


Since the study of derivatives requires plenty of mathematics and because all the readers might not have a solid mathematical background, the authors have tried to strike a balance between essential and non-essential mathematics and present many numerical problems for better and thorough understanding.


The book is tailored for beginners and no prior knowledge of options markets and futures is required.


The seventh edition of the book is new and improved and contains a variety of newly introduced topics. For instance, it discusses a lot of issues pertaining to the Indian market. Other topics covered include credit derivatives, swaps, Greek letters, binomial trees, volatility smiles, and interest rate futures.


The CD that comes with this edition is an added bonus and lets the users create useful applications in a few simple steps.


The numerical examples and practice questions help in easily understanding the concepts that have been explained. The minimal text in the book offers extensive knowledge and information in the form of theory. The book also features real life accounts and sound logical reasoning.


Options, Futures And Other Derivatives (With CD) was published in 2009 by Pearson.

Eagerly anticipated by millions of programmers, Java SE 8 is the most important Java update in many years. The addition of lambda expressions (closures) and streams represents the biggest change to Java programming since the introduction of generics and annotations.

Now, with Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient, internationally renowned Java author Cay S. Horstmann concisely introduces Java 8's most valuable new features (plus a few Java 7 innovations that haven't gotten the attention they deserve). If you're an experienced Java programmer, Horstmann's practical insights and sample code will help you quickly take advantage of these and other Java language and platform improvements. This indispensable guide includes
• Coverage of using lambda expressions (closures) to write computation ""snippets"" that can be passed to utility
functions
• The brand-new streams API that makes Java collections far more flexible and efficient
• Major updates to concurrent programming that make use of lambda expressions (filter/map/reduce) and that
provide dramatic performance improvements for shared counters and hash tables
• A full chapter with advice on how you can put lambda expressions to work in your own programs
• Coverage of the long-awaited introduction of a well-designed date/time/calendar library (JSR 310) • A concise introduction to JavaFX, which is positioned to replace Swing Guls, and to the Nashorn Javascript engine
• A thorough discussion of many small library changes that make Java programming more productive and enjoyable
This is the first title to cover all of these highly anticipated improvements and is invaluable for anyone who wants to write tomorrow's most robust, efficient, and secure Java code.

Cay S. Horstmann is the author of Scala for the Impatient (Addison-Wesley, 2012), is principal author of Core Java"", Volumes I and II, Ninth Edition (Prentice Hall, 2013), and has written a dozen other books for professional programmers and computer science students. He is a professor of computer science at San Jose State University and is a Java Champion.",Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient,Cay S.

The book offers a crisp introduction to options markets and futures.


Since the study of derivatives requires plenty of mathematics and because all the readers might not have a solid mathematical background, the authors have tried to strike a balance between essential and non-essential mathematics and present many numerical problems for better and thorough understanding.


The book is tailored for beginners and no prior knowledge of options markets and futures is required.


The seventh edition of the book is new and improved and contains a variety of newly introduced topics. For instance, it discusses a lot of issues pertaining to the Indian market. Other topics covered include credit derivatives, swaps, Greek letters, binomial trees, volatility smiles, and interest rate futures.


The CD that comes with this edition is an added bonus and lets the users create useful applications in a few simple steps.


The numerical examples and practice questions help in easily understanding the concepts that have been explained. The minimal text in the book offers extensive knowledge and information in the form of theory. The book also features real life accounts and sound logical reasoning.


Options, Futures And Other Derivatives (With CD) was published in 2009 by Pearson.
