In the book Rich Dad Poor Dad: What The Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not! Robert Kiyosaki advocates financial independence through owning businesses, investing, and real estate. He also talks about increasing one's financial intelligence.

What makes somebody rich? Is it hard work that matters the most? Or does one need to make the right financial decisions at the right time to be rich? This book answers these questions with the help of six easy to apprehend learn lessons. Written in the style of a set of parables, it is based on the real life of the author. Robert Kiyosaki takes the reader to his own childhood that he spent in Hawaii.

He promotes the philosophy of wealth creation and emphasizes on purchasing income generating assets. To prove his point, he offers real life examples and relates his own story in which he had two people who influenced him the most. One was his real father – an educator who worked hard to make money, and the other was his father’s best friend – a real estate tycoon who is the Rich Dad of the book and is extremely successful.  

His biological father, the Poor Dad of the story, bought consumer goods for his family’s satisfaction and had to remain financially dependent for his entire life. The Rich dad, on the other hand, used his money to create more money-making assets. And this is the attitude that the author highlights throughout the book and says is the basic difference between the poor and the rich.

He values the ownership of high value assets more than being just an ordinary employee. He provides a new look at an old financial mindset. This book claims to teach people how to become rich without requiring a high income and take control of one’s financial future.

The book remained on The New York Times paperback ‘advice’ chart for 100 weeks. It has sold more than 26 million copies. Robert Kiyosaki, a millionaire himself, teaches what kids need to be taught about money and how even poor parents train their kids to be rich someday!
