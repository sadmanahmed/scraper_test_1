The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind is a self-help book, in which the author focuses on his theory that harnessing the power of the subconscious mind can bring about an amazing and positive transformation in an individuals life.


Murphy puts forth the theory that the subconscious mind has profound influence on everything an individual does and experiences. He insists that if an individual unreservedly believes in something and clearly pictures it in his mind, he/she succeeds in removing all the mental blocks that stand between the vision and the reality. He concludes that every individual can manifest a successful reality just by wholly and truly believing in it.


Murphy has combined scientific research with spiritual philosophy to create numerous techniques to control the incredible power of the subconscious mind. The techniques provided in the book are simple and invaluable. They are not merely theoretical in nature, but are backed by numerous real-life cases in which the techniques have proven highly effective.


The exercises and guidelines provided are highly practical, and can be adopted by absolutely anybody to uncover the secrets of prosperous living. These exercises provide a wide range of benefits. They can be used to overcome bad habits, compulsions, and phobias, strengthen relationships, build confidence, cure ailments, improve health, fight aging, and be successful.


The book helps each reader explore and utilise the latent power granted to every human being - the power of the subconscious.


The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind was originally published in 1963. This particular edition is a revised edition by Ian McMahan. It was published in 2006.

A compiler is any kind of computer program which converts a particular code (source code) into another code (object code). This can be done for various reasons, especially for the purpose of creating executable programmes.

Compiler Design was written with the aim of acquainting students with the area of compiler design in a simple, easy to grasp manner. It attempts to present a holistic view of the subject by touching upon several related areas such as automata theory, computer architecture, algorithms, data structures and operating systems. The main content of the book is divided into 9 chapters. It is logically organised to move from various kinds of analyses to producing and eventually checking codes.

The book covers topics like design and theory of lexical analysis phase, parsers and the different types of parsers, regular expressions, type checking, type conversions, code generation techniques, intermediate code generation, global optimization, and symbol table.

What makes this book unique is that it was written through the author’s experiences not only as a researcher within this field, but also as a professor and dealing with his students and their problems. As such, Compiler Design is written in the style of a textbook, though it has a lucid and engaging style, which makes it useful as a reference book for professionals as well. It is mainly written as a textbook for a single semester in either an undergraduate or postgraduate introductory course to computer science.

Digital Integrated Circuits: A Design Perspective provides a comprehensive coverage of the implementation strategies and new design methodologies of digital integrated circuits. This text also talks about the new issues that impact performance, power dissipation, cost, and reliability of chips that are now as small as 100nm. This translates as increased importance in designing circuits, while considering deep submicron transistor effects, interconnect, low-power design and high-performance, and timing as well as clock distribution.

This text, unlike the first edition, focuses completely on CMOS ICs. Although new changes have been introduced in this edition, the core aspects of the earlier edition, such as the goal and spirit of the text, have been left untouched.

Digital Integrated Circuits: A Design Perspective opens with a discussion on the operation of electronic devices and a detailed analysis of the inverter, considered the nucleus of digital design. The text then flows into the design of modules such as adders, controllers, gates, memories, and multipliers.

There are three parts to the text, namely The Fabrics, A Circuit Perspective, and A System Perspective, and a total of twelve chapters contained within them. Each chapter of the text also contains numerous examples and brain teasers or exercise problems that helps the reader think about and understand the material better. The chapters are fed with actual design layouts and examples to aid the readers’ understanding. Solved design problems can be accessed by the readers on the website http://bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/IcBook.

This text is intended for use by undergraduate and postgraduate students of electronics studying digital circuit design.

The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind is a self-help book, in which the author focuses on his theory that harnessing the power of the subconscious mind can bring about an amazing and positive transformation in an individuals life.


Murphy puts forth the theory that the subconscious mind has profound influence on everything an individual does and experiences. He insists that if an individual unreservedly believes in something and clearly pictures it in his mind, he/she succeeds in removing all the mental blocks that stand between the vision and the reality. He concludes that every individual can manifest a successful reality just by wholly and truly believing in it.


Murphy has combined scientific research with spiritual philosophy to create numerous techniques to control the incredible power of the subconscious mind. The techniques provided in the book are simple and invaluable. They are not merely theoretical in nature, but are backed by numerous real-life cases in which the techniques have proven highly effective.


The exercises and guidelines provided are highly practical, and can be adopted by absolutely anybody to uncover the secrets of prosperous living. These exercises provide a wide range of benefits. They can be used to overcome bad habits, compulsions, and phobias, strengthen relationships, build confidence, cure ailments, improve health, fight aging, and be successful.


The book helps each reader explore and utilise the latent power granted to every human being - the power of the subconscious.


The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind was originally published in 1963. This particular edition is a revised edition by Ian McMahan. It was published in 2006.

A compiler is any kind of computer program which converts a particular code (source code) into another code (object code). This can be done for various reasons, especially for the purpose of creating executable programmes.

Compiler Design was written with the aim of acquainting students with the area of compiler design in a simple, easy to grasp manner. It attempts to present a holistic view of the subject by touching upon several related areas such as automata theory, computer architecture, algorithms, data structures and operating systems. The main content of the book is divided into 9 chapters. It is logically organised to move from various kinds of analyses to producing and eventually checking codes.

The book covers topics like design and theory of lexical analysis phase, parsers and the different types of parsers, regular expressions, type checking, type conversions, code generation techniques, intermediate code generation, global optimization, and symbol table.

What makes this book unique is that it was written through the author’s experiences not only as a researcher within this field, but also as a professor and dealing with his students and their problems. As such, Compiler Design is written in the style of a textbook, though it has a lucid and engaging style, which makes it useful as a reference book for professionals as well. It is mainly written as a textbook for a single semester in either an undergraduate or postgraduate introductory course to computer science.

Digital Integrated Circuits: A Design Perspective provides a comprehensive coverage of the implementation strategies and new design methodologies of digital integrated circuits. This text also talks about the new issues that impact performance, power dissipation, cost, and reliability of chips that are now as small as 100nm. This translates as increased importance in designing circuits, while considering deep submicron transistor effects, interconnect, low-power design and high-performance, and timing as well as clock distribution.

This text, unlike the first edition, focuses completely on CMOS ICs. Although new changes have been introduced in this edition, the core aspects of the earlier edition, such as the goal and spirit of the text, have been left untouched.

Digital Integrated Circuits: A Design Perspective opens with a discussion on the operation of electronic devices and a detailed analysis of the inverter, considered the nucleus of digital design. The text then flows into the design of modules such as adders, controllers, gates, memories, and multipliers.

There are three parts to the text, namely The Fabrics, A Circuit Perspective, and A System Perspective, and a total of twelve chapters contained within them. Each chapter of the text also contains numerous examples and brain teasers or exercise problems that helps the reader think about and understand the material better. The chapters are fed with actual design layouts and examples to aid the readers’ understanding. Solved design problems can be accessed by the readers on the website http://bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/IcBook.

This text is intended for use by undergraduate and postgraduate students of electronics studying digital circuit design.
