When five-thousand-year-old human bones are found at a construction site in the small town of Woodsboro, the news draws archaeologist Callie Dunbrook out of her sabbatical and into a whirlwind of adventure, danger and romance.

To begin with she must try to make sense of the cloud of death and misfortune that hangs over the dig - fuelling rumours that the site is cursed. She must also cope with the presence of her irritating - but still irresistible - ex-husband, Hake. But when a stranger appears, claiming to know a secret about her childhood, Callie is forced to also question her own past . . . and what she's kept hidden for so long.",Birthright,Nora roberts, , ,Piatkus Books ,9780749940423,"1st Edition,2009",544,India,English
