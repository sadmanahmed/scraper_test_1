In Blink: The Power Of Thinking Without Thinking, Malcolm Gladwell explores the depths of human intuition and how anyone can develop the ability to make quick, yet accurate decisions. These decisions are termed as snap judgements in the book, and the author makes a case for how snap judgements can be more efficient than reasoned decisions, which require deliberation.

The author terms the instinctive side of our mind as the adaptive unconscious. This is the part of the brain that we use for rapid cognition, and for quickly picking out the finer details that matter from among a host of variables.

Blink: The Power Of Thinking Without Thinking isn’t just about the analysis of this phenomenon. Malcolm Gladwell reveals the secret behind using the power of snap judgements in everyday life. He also attempts to detail the different kinds of situations where these decisions are a bad idea, such as the shooting of Amadou Diallo in 1999.

Another phenomenon that the author talks about is called thin slicing. This is the ability to cut out a slice of relevant information from amidst the chaos of information, which presents itself in the first instant that a decision needs to be made. Through studies, he highlights the truth behind whether experts make their best decisions based on instinct or if information analysis still trumps the former.

Conclusions in this book are put forward through a diverse set of examples. The power of intuition is attributed to specific events, like when artists can tell if a historic artifact is fake within an instant, or how a commander used World War II technology to out-maneuver the collective strength of the US armed forces.

Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules begins with the protagonist, Greg, complaining about how bad his summer holidays were. He has a lot of trouble with his brother, Rodrick, who accidentally caught Greg in a rather embarrassing situation. Desperate to keep things secret, Greg tries hard to ingratiate himself with his brother.

Rodrick does everything possible to make Greg’s life difficult over the summer, but the “wimpy kid” puts up with it all, just so his unfortunate faux-pas doesn’t come to light. When their mother finds out that they are always short on cash, she starts a “Mom Bucks” scheme, giving both the children money.

Amidst getting grounded by his parents and bullied by his brother, Greg Heffley has a lot on his mind. Does he manage to keep his secret, or does Rodrick ultimately spill the beans? What happens to Rodrick’s band, and his science project? Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules has a number of hilarious situations that make for great reading.

The Wimpy Kid series has sold more than sixty million copies throughout the world, and the first book in the series, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, was adapted into a movie, which was a big success.

Ezio Auditore continues on the assassin trail, following his training in the prequel Assassin’s Creed Renaissance. What started out as a vendetta for his family’s murder turns out to be fierce battle between the forces of good and evil. Ezio soon finds out that he has bitten off more than he can chew. It’s a one-man army against the ruthless Borgia family.

Ezio’s skills as a master assassin are tested time and again. In a desperate situation, only Ezio’s quick thinking can save his life. Mario continues to play the role of a mentor and guide for Ezio. However, Mario is literally courting death and he seems to be running out of time. There’s still a lot that Mario has to pass on to his prize pupil, Ezio. Will he be able to make it to the end or will the clock stop ticking for him soon? Ezio wields an ancient weapon of power, the apple, which he and Mario managed to secure in The Renaissance. The question that now confronts him is, when and how should he use the apple?

Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood is set in 15th century Rome. The glory of Rome has long evaporated into the now colossal ruins that stand as silent witnesses to the fall of a mighty empire. The degradation hasn’t left the people of Rome unaffected. Torn by strife, hunger, oppression and tyranny of a callous ruler, the people of Rome are living in the shadows of death and privation. Time isn’t a luxury for Ezio, deception and betrayal is rampant even among the closely knit brotherhood. With Cesare Borgia determined to take over all of Italy, can Ezio Auditore be the people’s savior? The fate of Rome now rests in his hands.

""The Sea of Monsters"" by Rick Riordan is the second book in the ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians"" series. In this book, Percy Jackson takes on a quest to save his beloved Camp Half Blood. This book is a tale of Good vs Evil as seen from the point of view of Percy. He must not only fight for the camp but the lives of those around him that he cares about. This book combines the current world with the world of the Greek mythological gods such as Zeus and Poseidon.

Percy Jackson is seen nearing the end of his seventh grade year and although excited about being done with the school, and going to Camp Half Blood for the summer, Percy is concerned about a vivid dream he has had regarding his friend Grover. Percy is not sure what the dream has meant but ultimately decides he has to focus on school. When Percy arrives at school he and his friend, Tyson, are bullied by a group of new boys that have arrived. Tyson tells Percy that the boys have a funny smell and soon the boys begin to develop into large monsters and attack Percy. Tyson comes to Percy's rescue and soon Percy's friend Annabeth also arrives to help and they soon destroy the monsters, and the school.

Percy, Annabeth, and Tyson leave to go to Camp Half-Blood immediately. When they arrive Percy finds that someone has poisoned the magical tree that was created out of Thalia, Zeus' daughter, was injured. Thalia's tree protects Camp Half-Blood but since it is weakened the campers are under constant attack from various monsters. When Percy arrives at Camp he looks at Tyson and realizes he is not a big silly kid, but is in fact a cyclops and in addition to this is also the son of Poseidon, making Tyson Percy's half-brother. Percy and the others at Camp are ordered not go out to find Grover, even though Percy has decided that Grover needs his help and may have a cure for Thalia's tree. Hermes arrives and helps Percy, Tyson, and Annabeth leave camp to go on their quest.

Poseidon sends Hippocampi to assist Percy and the others on the way to find Grover and they soon board a boat manned by a school mate and a crew of dead soldiers. The boat eventually is destroyed in an attempt to reach their destination and Percy believes everyone has died except him and Annabeth. When Percy and Annabeth reach the Island they find that Grover is being held captive by a large Polyphemus, a large cyclops. They are able to rescue Grover and the item that can save Thalia's tree, a golden fleece. While escaping Tyson shows up and helps them evade Polyphemus. When they arrive back at Camp Half-Blood with the golden fleece the tree does revive. Percy has been told of a prophecy that regards a child of the gods although it does not specify which child. It is believed by many that Percy is the only child it could be. When the fleece is put on Thalia's tree Thalia is pulled from the tree, fully recovered. Percy realizes that Thalia could be the child that the prophecy speaks of that could destroy Olympus and that this is the reason the tree had been poisoned.

French philosopher Michel Foucault wrote Discipline And Punish: The Birth Of The Prison, with a view to analyse the various mechanisms that led to significant changes in the penal systems in the West, during the modern ages, while focussing on the French system.

Discipline and Punish: The Birth Of The Prison begins by discussing how the concept of punishment has evolved over time. It chronicles the different types of disciplinary systems in societies, while studying the differences in punishment systems used in the past as compared to modern times.

The book is a gripping body of work, with brilliant, philosophical insights, that suggest a distinct shift in focus of punishment, from the prisoner's body, to his soul, as can be seen from the reforms made, such as abolishing torture, and the evolution of the present day penitentiary system.

The main themes discussed in the book are punishment, torture, discipline, and prison. In the Middle Ages, gaols and dungeons served as prisons, however, punishment was delivered by making it a public spectacle. This early emphasis on public torture, is described in an account of a regicide's excruciatingly slow death, in the mid-eighteenth century. With the passage of time, socio economic and cultural changes called for a better system of control over individuals.

Foucault explains how the Western system of prisons, police organizations, administrative and legal hierarchies, grew in prominence, as a result of the shift of emphasis from the very direct and vengeful forms of punishment, to a much more covert ‘power of discipline’. This power germinated from institutions such as schools, barracks, factories, and hospitals which all commonly exercise control on individuals on an hour-to-hour basis.

Considered a best-selling work of critical and social theory, Foucault’s Discipline And Punish: The Birth Of The Prison, with its numerous editions, is prescribed and studied as a key text for many undergraduate courses across a wide range of disciplines.

Picking up after the events of House of Hades, our heroes are divided into two groups.

The first group is made up of Jason, Piper, and Leo (along with Percy, Annabeth, Frank, and Hazel). They're on the Argo II and they need to make it to the Acropolis stat. That's where Gaea, the Earth Mother, is supposed to awaken, and they need to stop it. (Of course, as goes with prophecies, trying to stop it is totally going to make it happen.)

Our other group is made up of Nico and Reyna who, along with Coach Hedge, are trying to get the Athena Parthenos statue back to Camp Half-Blood as a symbol of truce between Greeks and Romans…and hopefully stop Octavian from launching an onslaught against the camp. 
With Nico's handy dandy shadow-travel ability, they're able to zip between time zones with the statue in tow. They travel through Pompeii, Portugal, a cruise ship in the Atlantic, Puerto Rico, and South Carolina, all exotic locales in their own rights. Along the way, they fight hordes of undead and hordes of werewolves and are pursued by a psychopath named Orion.

In Puerto Rico, Reyna's home, Reyna reluctantly reunites with her sister, Hylla, who wants to use her as bait for Orion. Bad idea. Orion wipes out most of the Hunters of Artemis before Reyna can escape. (Don't worry, sis is fine.) Orion catches up with Reyna near Camp Half-Blood, and Reyna summons her inner strength to defeat him.

As Nico sabotages Octavian's efforts to attack Camp-Half Blood, Reyna delivers the statue just in time…in time for Gaea to awaken, that is. Wait, how did that happen? Let's go back to team one.

Jason, Annabeth, and Piper learn that the strait of Corinth is chock full of death, and they have to go around the entire Peloponnese in order to reach Athens. They're advised to seek out Nike, the goddess of victory, along the way. She mentions yet another prophecy: one of them…will…die. Le gasp! But she advises them to seek out the physician's cure, which can bring someone back to life.

They retrieve the ingredients on their journey. Along the way, Jason is impaled, Percy is poisoned, Annabeth gets really scared, and everyone does battle with a statue demanding to see their health insurance. With the cure in hand, they reach the Parthenon where, yep, they end up feeding into the prophecy. Percy and Annabeth are injured, and their blood awakens Gaea.

Way to go, guys.

When Gabriel García Márquez contracted lymphatic cancer in 1999 and published the first volume of his projected three-part autobiography, Living to Tell the Tale (2002), many of his admirers thought this was his swan song, that he would never write fiction again. Now, in Memories of My Melancholy Whores, his first book of fiction in ten years, a novella of a little over one hundred pages, he returns to a fairy-tale form that he has used in short fictions in the past. Some may see this novel as a sort of new breath of life for García Márquez, who seems to have successfully triumphed over his cancer. Others may see it as the perverse dream of an old man who has nothing to look forward to other than death; at the time of the book’s publication, García Márquez was seventy-eight years old. Even before the official publication of Memoria de mis putas tristes in Spain and Latin America, the little book was eagerly anticipated, with street vendors hawking pirated copies. To protect their investment of a million-copy release, the Spanish-language publishers were quick to report that García Márquez had made significant changes at the last minute to the final chapter.

The plot of Memories of My Melancholy Whores is quite simple, summed up in the initial sentence, in which the unnamed, first-person narrator says simply that on his ninetieth birthday he wants to give himself the gift of a riotous night of lovemaking with an adolescent virgin. The remainder of the book recounts the results of this decision by the narrator, a journalist in a Colombian town. The most important result is that the elderly hero does not engage in a night of sexuality with a young girl, but instead sits by her bed, watching her as she sleeps. For the remainder of his ninetieth year he returns to the brothel night after night, continuing to watch the girl sleep, hardly ever touching her and hearing her voice only once. However, he falls helplessly in love with her and, as improbable as it may seem, she ultimately falls in love with him. They finally come together as a most unlikely couple on the last page.

Some critics have chastised the author and the novel’s hero as dirty old men who have no social conscience about the exploitation of young women in developing nations, but it is a misunderstanding of the tradition of Memories of My Melancholy Whores, as well as García Márquez’s obvious intention, to label this a perverted book about an old man’s wicked lust for a teenage girl. As García Márquez has suggested in previous works, visiting a brothel does not have the same unsavory aspect in Colombia as it does in the United States. Indeed, the author of the classic Cien años de soledad (1967; One Hundred Years of Solitude, 1970) has praised the brothels of Bogota, where he studied law, even though he was once beaten up there for failing to pay a prostitute. There is no sordid reality of young women made chattel to men with money in the book. Rather, the story is about enrapt attention, fantasy, the romantic dream of pure ideal love.

Although the protagonist realizes that sex is merely a consolation for not having love, he has never been able to experience love; indeed has never had sex with a woman unless he paid for it. That the final object of his desire is a fourteen-year-old girl has nothing to do with the social issue of preying on the helpless and innocent. Neither love nor sex in this novel has anything to do with social reality; the story is rather a complete romantic idealization of the art-like object of desire. The romantic nature of the old man’s silent observation of the girl as he watches her each night can be compared to the famous metaphor that opens the quintessential Romantic adoration of an untouched objectJohn Keats’s “Ode on a Grecian Urn.” For the young girl in García Márquez’s novel is a frozen work of art, not to be approached if the true nature of ideal romantic love is to be sustained. She is indeed Keats’s “still unravished bride of quietness,” a “foster-child of silence and slow time.” The protagonist knows that he does not want her to awaken, does not want to hear her voice, does not want to see her in daylight but rather wishes only to watch her in silence.",Memories of my Melancholy Whores (Nobel Prize Winner's),Gabriel Garcia Marquez, , ,Penguin Books Ltd,9780241968543,"1st Edition,2014",116,India,English

The narrative begins just after Tom Joad is paroled from McAlester prison, where he had been imprisoned after being convicted of homicide. On his return to his home near Sallisaw, Oklahoma, Tom meets former preacher Jim Casy, whom he remembers from his childhood, and the two travel together. When they arrive at Tom's childhood farm home, they find it deserted. Disconcerted and confused, Tom and Casy meet their old neighbor, Muley Graves, who tells them the family has gone to stay at Uncle John Joad's home nearby. Graves tells them that the banks have evicted all the farmers, but he refuses to leave the area.

The next morning, Tom and Casy go to Uncle John's. Tom finds his family loading their remaining possessions into a Hudson Motor Car Company sedan converted to a truck; with their crops destroyed by the Dust Bowl, the family has defaulted on their bank loans, and their farm has been repossessed. Consequently, the Joads see no option but to seek work in California, described in handbills as fruitful and offering high pay.

The Joads put everything they have into making the journey. Although leaving Oklahoma would violate his parole, Tom decides it is worth the risk, and invites Casy to join him and his family.

Traveling west on Route 66, the Joad family find the road crowded with other migrants. In makeshift camps, they hear many stories from others, some returning from California, and the group worries about lessening prospects. The family dwindles as well: Grandpa dies along the road, and they bury him in a field; Grandma dies close to the California state line; and both Noah (the eldest Joad son) and Connie Rivers (the husband of the pregnant Joad daughter, Rose of Sharon) leave the family. Led by Ma, the remaining members realize they can only continue, as nothing is left for them in Oklahoma.

Reaching California, they find the state oversupplied with labor; wages are low, and workers are exploited to the point of starvation. The big corporate farmers are in collusion and smaller farmers suffer from collapsing prices. Weedpatch Camp, one of the clean, utility-supplied camps operated by the Resettlement Administration, a New Deal agency, offers better conditions but does not have enough resources to care for all the needy families. Nonetheless, as a Federal facility, the camp protects the migrants from harassment by California deputies.

In response to the exploitation, Casy becomes a labor organizer and tries to recruit for a labor union. The remaining Joads work as strikebreakers in a peach orchard, where Casy is involved in a strike that eventually turns violent. When Tom Joad witnesses Casy's fatal beating, he kills the attacker and flees as a fugitive. The Joads later leave the orchard for a cotton farm, where Tom is at risk of being arrested for the homicide.

Tom bids his mother farewell and promises to work for the oppressed. Rose of Sharon's baby is stillborn. Ma Joad remains steadfast and forces the family through the bereavement. With rain, the Joads' dwelling is flooded, and they move to higher ground. In the final chapter of the book, the family takes shelter from the flood in an old barn. Inside they find a young boy and his father, who is dying of starvation.

Howard Roark is a brilliant architect who is despised the most for his sheer ability and his disregard for conservatism in architecture. Peter Keating, on the other hand, is a famous, yet an inane architect, who acquires a job in a renowned firm. Although Roark creates remarkable works, they go unnoticed or chided. His association with the fallen hero Henry Cameron doesn’t help him much either. Ellsworth Toohey owns a famous architecture column, whose writing pretty much has the power to make or break an architect’s life. Dominique, although attracted to Roark the very first time she sees him, accuses him of a rape after their brief sexual encounter. Gail Wynand is the editor-in-chief of the famous Banner. The lives of Keating, Wynand, Dominique and Roark become intertwined due to shocking twists and turns that Ayn weaves magically in this book, which was way ahead of its times.

After writing about Greek Gods and demigods, Rick Riordan turned his attention to Egypt for a new series. The Red Pyramid is the first of a series where the main characters are descended from Pharaohs and Egyptian magicians.

Carter Kane is fourteen and he lives and travels around the world with his Egyptologist father, Julius Kane. He has a younger sister Sadie, who is twelve years old. Sadie lives with her grandparents in London. Julius Kane takes Carter to London to visit Sadie and spend time together as a family during Christmas. After picking up Sadie, Julius takes his children to visit the British Museum. On the way, the children see their father speaking to a man they do not know.

At the museum, Julius, who is actually an Egyptian magician, tries to summon the Egyptian God Osiris. In the process he also releases the other Egyptian Gods born on the Demon Days, Horus, Nephthys, Set and Isis. Set imprisons Julius. The stunned children who are witnesses to the incident are taken into custody by the British police. However, they are rescued from further trouble by the mysterious stranger they saw their father talking to some time earlier.

The man turns out to be Amos Kane, their uncle. He takes them to their family home, a huge mansion. He tells them they can explore the house, but to stay out of the library. So, naturally, the two go to the library. Set’s army begins an attack on the mansion. However, Sadie’s cat Muffin, who is actually the cat goddess Bast, saves the children. They later meet Zia Rashid who also helps the kids escape.

They are taken to Egypt, to the House Of Life, to be trained as magicians. But, when the chief of the magicians dies and a new one takes over, the children are seen as a threat and they have to flee.

The Red Pyramid then takes the two children around the world, from Egypt to Paris to Washington, as they try to find a way to stop Set and rescue their father.

The Age Of Reason is based on Sartre’s existential notion of freedom. Existentialism is a branch in philosophy which is concerned with an individual’s existence. According to this school of thought, thinking, feeling, and acting, all begin with the individual subject. This is what gives meaning to life.

Through the choices, dialogues, and psychologies of the characters in the book, Sartre demonstrates how individuals with this philosophy operate in society. Sartre’s story is set in the 1930s, and occurs over a time period of two days.

Mathieu Delarue, a philosophy teacher, is the protagonist of Sartre’s The Age Of Reason. Freedom and being free are the hallmarks of Delarue’s lifestyle. Things go awry when his mistress Marcelle becomes pregnant. Delarue is plunged into a quandary. He contemplates whether giving up his freedom and existential-type life is more important than having a baby. Delarue decides that his freedom is more valuable, and so he urges Marcelle to get an abortion. To further complicate matters, the shadows of World War II begin to loom.

Delarue requires around 4,000 francs in order to have the abortion procedure done. As he tries to gather the money from his friends and family, Marcelle realizes that she wants to have the baby after all. Daniel, a homosexual character in the story, tries to convince her to marry him, just so that she could have her baby. He also secretly desires to see Delarue’s downfall. Even Delarue’s older brother refuses to lend him the money for the procedure, but offers him more than double the amount to wed Marcelle. Delarue’s brother also reminds him that he is no longer youthful and therefore has attained the age of reason. This leaves Delarue wondering whether attaining the age of reason means losing his freedom.

Through Delarue, Sartre forces readers to explore the idea of what it means to achieve freedom from notions such as conformity, material attachments, responsibilities, and even others’ expectations. Although the notion of freedom might mean different things to different people, the notion might simply be an abstract one rather than something that truly exists.

The Age Of Reason was first published in 1945.

In Blink: The Power Of Thinking Without Thinking, Malcolm Gladwell explores the depths of human intuition and how anyone can develop the ability to make quick, yet accurate decisions. These decisions are termed as snap judgements in the book, and the author makes a case for how snap judgements can be more efficient than reasoned decisions, which require deliberation.

The author terms the instinctive side of our mind as the adaptive unconscious. This is the part of the brain that we use for rapid cognition, and for quickly picking out the finer details that matter from among a host of variables.

Blink: The Power Of Thinking Without Thinking isn’t just about the analysis of this phenomenon. Malcolm Gladwell reveals the secret behind using the power of snap judgements in everyday life. He also attempts to detail the different kinds of situations where these decisions are a bad idea, such as the shooting of Amadou Diallo in 1999.

Another phenomenon that the author talks about is called thin slicing. This is the ability to cut out a slice of relevant information from amidst the chaos of information, which presents itself in the first instant that a decision needs to be made. Through studies, he highlights the truth behind whether experts make their best decisions based on instinct or if information analysis still trumps the former.

Conclusions in this book are put forward through a diverse set of examples. The power of intuition is attributed to specific events, like when artists can tell if a historic artifact is fake within an instant, or how a commander used World War II technology to out-maneuver the collective strength of the US armed forces.

About Malcolm Gladwell

Malcolm Gladwell is a journalist, speaker and bestselling author whose work explores academic findings on psychology, sociology and social psychology.

His other books include The Tipping Point: How Little Things Make a Big Difference, What The Dog Saw: And Other Adventures and David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants.

Malcolm Gladwell’s writing process revolves around the analysis, interpretation and representation of valuable research. He has earned a place in the minds of his readers as a credible source by shunning personal opinion, and instead relying on research findings to tell the story. As his work tends to rely on scientific research, one of his greatest strengths is his ability to talk about scientific data in a way that anyone can understand.

Malcolm Gladwell was born in Hampshire, England and from the age of 6 he has spent most of his life in Ontario, Canada, where his family relocated. He was recognized for the second-highest form of honour for merit in his country, by being appointed to the Order of Canada.",Blink : The Power of Thinking Without Thinking(The No.1 International Bestseller),Malcolm Gladwell, , ,Penguin Books Ltd,9780141014593,"Reprint edition,2013",304,India,English

Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules begins with the protagonist, Greg, complaining about how bad his summer holidays were. He has a lot of trouble with his brother, Rodrick, who accidentally caught Greg in a rather embarrassing situation. Desperate to keep things secret, Greg tries hard to ingratiate himself with his brother.

Rodrick does everything possible to make Greg’s life difficult over the summer, but the “wimpy kid” puts up with it all, just so his unfortunate faux-pas doesn’t come to light. When their mother finds out that they are always short on cash, she starts a “Mom Bucks” scheme, giving both the children money. Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules has a great combination of hard-luck situations that readers can relate to.

While Rodrick spends it all on rock magazines, Greg carefully saves up, but still ends up losing all his money owing to unfortunate circumstances (and his big brother Rodrick, of course). Rodrick has a science project coming up, but is more interested in playing with his band, the Loded Diper, in an upcoming show.

Amidst getting grounded by his parents and bullied by his brother, Greg Heffley has a lot on his mind. Does he manage to keep his secret, or does Rodrick ultimately spill the beans? What happens to Rodrick’s band, and his science project? Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules has a number of hilarious situations that make for great reading.

The Wimpy Kid series has sold more than sixty million copies throughout the world, and the first book in the series, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, was adapted into a movie, which was a big success.

Ezio Auditore continues on the assassin trail, following his training in the prequel Assassin’s Creed Renaissance. What started out as a vendetta for his family’s murder turns out to be fierce battle between the forces of good and evil. Ezio soon finds out that he has bitten off more than he can chew. It’s a one-man army against the ruthless Borgia family.

Ezio’s skills as a master assassin are tested time and again. In a desperate situation, only Ezio’s quick thinking can save his life. Mario continues to play the role of a mentor and guide for Ezio. However, Mario is literally courting death and he seems to be running out of time. There’s still a lot that Mario has to pass on to his prize pupil, Ezio. Will he be able to make it to the end or will the clock stop ticking for him soon? Ezio wields an ancient weapon of power, the apple, which he and Mario managed to secure in The Renaissance. The question that now confronts him is, when and how should he use the apple?

Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood is set in 15th century Rome. The glory of Rome has long evaporated into the now colossal ruins that stand as silent witnesses to the fall of a mighty empire. The degradation hasn’t left the people of Rome unaffected. Torn by strife, hunger, oppression and tyranny of a callous ruler, the people of Rome are living in the shadows of death and privation. Time isn’t a luxury for Ezio, deception and betrayal is rampant even among the closely knit brotherhood. With Cesare Borgia determined to take over all of Italy, can Ezio Auditore be the people’s savior? The fate of Rome now rests in his hands.

""The Sea of Monsters"" by Rick Riordan is the second book in the ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians"" series. In this book, Percy Jackson takes on a quest to save his beloved Camp Half Blood. This book is a tale of Good vs Evil as seen from the point of view of Percy. He must not only fight for the camp but the lives of those around him that he cares about. This book combines the current world with the world of the Greek mythological gods such as Zeus and Poseidon.

Percy Jackson is seen nearing the end of his seventh grade year and although excited about being done with the school, and going to Camp Half Blood for the summer, Percy is concerned about a vivid dream he has had regarding his friend Grover. Percy is not sure what the dream has meant but ultimately decides he has to focus on school. When Percy arrives at school he and his friend, Tyson, are bullied by a group of new boys that have arrived. Tyson tells Percy that the boys have a funny smell and soon the boys begin to develop into large monsters and attack Percy. Tyson comes to Percy's rescue and soon Percy's friend Annabeth also arrives to help and they soon destroy the monsters, and the school.

Percy, Annabeth, and Tyson leave to go to Camp Half-Blood immediately. When they arrive Percy finds that someone has poisoned the magical tree that was created out of Thalia, Zeus' daughter, was injured. Thalia's tree protects Camp Half-Blood but since it is weakened the campers are under constant attack from various monsters. When Percy arrives at Camp he looks at Tyson and realizes he is not a big silly kid, but is in fact a cyclops and in addition to this is also the son of Poseidon, making Tyson Percy's half-brother. Percy and the others at Camp are ordered not go out to find Grover, even though Percy has decided that Grover needs his help and may have a cure for Thalia's tree. Hermes arrives and helps Percy, Tyson, and Annabeth leave camp to go on their quest.

Poseidon sends Hippocampi to assist Percy and the others on the way to find Grover and they soon board a boat manned by a school mate and a crew of dead soldiers. The boat eventually is destroyed in an attempt to reach their destination and Percy believes everyone has died except him and Annabeth. When Percy and Annabeth reach the Island they find that Grover is being held captive by a large Polyphemus, a large cyclops. They are able to rescue Grover and the item that can save Thalia's tree, a golden fleece. While escaping Tyson shows up and helps them evade Polyphemus. When they arrive back at Camp Half-Blood with the golden fleece the tree does revive. Percy has been told of a prophecy that regards a child of the gods although it does not specify which child. It is believed by many that Percy is the only child it could be. When the fleece is put on Thalia's tree Thalia is pulled from the tree, fully recovered. Percy realizes that Thalia could be the child that the prophecy speaks of that could destroy Olympus and that this is the reason the tree had been poisoned.

French philosopher Michel Foucault wrote Discipline And Punish: The Birth Of The Prison, with a view to analyse the various mechanisms that led to significant changes in the penal systems in the West, during the modern ages, while focussing on the French system.

Discipline and Punish: The Birth Of The Prison begins by discussing how the concept of punishment has evolved over time. It chronicles the different types of disciplinary systems in societies, while studying the differences in punishment systems used in the past as compared to modern times.

The book is a gripping body of work, with brilliant, philosophical insights, that suggest a distinct shift in focus of punishment, from the prisoner's body, to his soul, as can be seen from the reforms made, such as abolishing torture, and the evolution of the present day penitentiary system.

The main themes discussed in the book are punishment, torture, discipline, and prison. In the Middle Ages, gaols and dungeons served as prisons, however, punishment was delivered by making it a public spectacle. This early emphasis on public torture, is described in an account of a regicide's excruciatingly slow death, in the mid-eighteenth century. With the passage of time, socio economic and cultural changes called for a better system of control over individuals.

Foucault explains how the Western system of prisons, police organizations, administrative and legal hierarchies, grew in prominence, as a result of the shift of emphasis from the very direct and vengeful forms of punishment, to a much more covert ‘power of discipline’. This power germinated from institutions such as schools, barracks, factories, and hospitals which all commonly exercise control on individuals on an hour-to-hour basis.

Considered a best-selling work of critical and social theory, Foucault’s Discipline And Punish: The Birth Of The Prison, with its numerous editions, is prescribed and studied as a key text for many undergraduate courses across a wide range of disciplines.

Picking up after the events of House of Hades, our heroes are divided into two groups.

The first group is made up of Jason, Piper, and Leo (along with Percy, Annabeth, Frank, and Hazel). They're on the Argo II and they need to make it to the Acropolis stat. That's where Gaea, the Earth Mother, is supposed to awaken, and they need to stop it. (Of course, as goes with prophecies, trying to stop it is totally going to make it happen.)

Our other group is made up of Nico and Reyna who, along with Coach Hedge, are trying to get the Athena Parthenos statue back to Camp Half-Blood as a symbol of truce between Greeks and Romans…and hopefully stop Octavian from launching an onslaught against the camp. 
With Nico's handy dandy shadow-travel ability, they're able to zip between time zones with the statue in tow. They travel through Pompeii, Portugal, a cruise ship in the Atlantic, Puerto Rico, and South Carolina, all exotic locales in their own rights. Along the way, they fight hordes of undead and hordes of werewolves and are pursued by a psychopath named Orion.

In Puerto Rico, Reyna's home, Reyna reluctantly reunites with her sister, Hylla, who wants to use her as bait for Orion. Bad idea. Orion wipes out most of the Hunters of Artemis before Reyna can escape. (Don't worry, sis is fine.) Orion catches up with Reyna near Camp Half-Blood, and Reyna summons her inner strength to defeat him.

As Nico sabotages Octavian's efforts to attack Camp-Half Blood, Reyna delivers the statue just in time…in time for Gaea to awaken, that is. Wait, how did that happen? Let's go back to team one.

Jason, Annabeth, and Piper learn that the strait of Corinth is chock full of death, and they have to go around the entire Peloponnese in order to reach Athens. They're advised to seek out Nike, the goddess of victory, along the way. She mentions yet another prophecy: one of them…will…die. Le gasp! But she advises them to seek out the physician's cure, which can bring someone back to life.

They retrieve the ingredients on their journey. Along the way, Jason is impaled, Percy is poisoned, Annabeth gets really scared, and everyone does battle with a statue demanding to see their health insurance. With the cure in hand, they reach the Parthenon where, yep, they end up feeding into the prophecy. Percy and Annabeth are injured, and their blood awakens Gaea.

Way to go, guys.

Leo flies in on a giant mechanical dragon, hauls Gaea's dirty butt into the sky, and blows her up. He manages to self-administer the cure, which brings him back to life, and he flies to the island of Calypso, the girl he loves.

When Gabriel García Márquez contracted lymphatic cancer in 1999 and published the first volume of his projected three-part autobiography, Living to Tell the Tale (2002), many of his admirers thought this was his swan song, that he would never write fiction again. Now, in Memories of My Melancholy Whores, his first book of fiction in ten years, a novella of a little over one hundred pages, he returns to a fairy-tale form that he has used in short fictions in the past. Some may see this novel as a sort of new breath of life for García Márquez, who seems to have successfully triumphed over his cancer. Others may see it as the perverse dream of an old man who has nothing to look forward to other than death; at the time of the book’s publication, García Márquez was seventy-eight years old. Even before the official publication of Memoria de mis putas tristes in Spain and Latin America, the little book was eagerly anticipated, with street vendors hawking pirated copies. To protect their investment of a million-copy release, the Spanish-language publishers were quick to report that García Márquez had made significant changes at the last minute to the final chapter.

The plot of Memories of My Melancholy Whores is quite simple, summed up in the initial sentence, in which the unnamed, first-person narrator says simply that on his ninetieth birthday he wants to give himself the gift of a riotous night of lovemaking with an adolescent virgin. The remainder of the book recounts the results of this decision by the narrator, a journalist in a Colombian town. The most important result is that the elderly hero does not engage in a night of sexuality with a young girl, but instead sits by her bed, watching her as she sleeps. For the remainder of his ninetieth year he returns to the brothel night after night, continuing to watch the girl sleep, hardly ever touching her and hearing her voice only once. However, he falls helplessly in love with her and, as improbable as it may seem, she ultimately falls in love with him. They finally come together as a most unlikely couple on the last page.

Some critics have chastised the author and the novel’s hero as dirty old men who have no social conscience about the exploitation of young women in developing nations, but it is a misunderstanding of the tradition of Memories of My Melancholy Whores, as well as García Márquez’s obvious intention, to label this a perverted book about an old man’s wicked lust for a teenage girl. As García Márquez has suggested in previous works, visiting a brothel does not have the same unsavory aspect in Colombia as it does in the United States. Indeed, the author of the classic Cien años de soledad (1967; One Hundred Years of Solitude, 1970) has praised the brothels of Bogota, where he studied law, even though he was once beaten up there for failing to pay a prostitute. There is no sordid reality of young women made chattel to men with money in the book. Rather, the story is about enrapt attention, fantasy, the romantic dream of pure ideal love.

Although the protagonist realizes that sex is merely a consolation for not having love, he has never been able to experience love; indeed has never had sex with a woman unless he paid for it. That the final object of his desire is a fourteen-year-old girl has nothing to do with the social issue of preying on the helpless and innocent. Neither love nor sex in this novel has anything to do with social reality; the story is rather a complete romantic idealization of the art-like object of desire. The romantic nature of the old man’s silent observation of the girl as he watches her each night can be compared to the famous metaphor that opens the quintessential Romantic adoration of an untouched objectJohn Keats’s “Ode on a Grecian Urn.” For the young girl in García Márquez’s novel is a frozen work of art, not to be approached if the true nature of ideal romantic love is to be sustained. She is indeed Keats’s “still unravished bride of quietness,” a “foster-child of silence and slow time.” The protagonist knows that he does not want her to awaken, does not want to hear her voice, does not want to see her in daylight but rather wishes only to watch her in silence.",Memories of my Melancholy Whores (Nobel Prize Winner's),Gabriel Garcia Marquez, , ,Penguin Books Ltd,9780241968543,"1st Edition,2014",116,India,English

Readers can rest assured though, the things that they drag out of this abyss is sure to shock and inspire awe. So dive in with them if you’re interested in knowing how much one’s upbringing really matters or how real estate agents and members of the Ku Klux Klan are similar. A word of caution however, the answers Levitt and Dubner give you will definitely shock you.

The next morning, Tom and Casy go to Uncle John's. Tom finds his family loading their remaining possessions into a Hudson Motor Car Company sedan converted to a truck; with their crops destroyed by the Dust Bowl, the family has defaulted on their bank loans, and their farm has been repossessed. Consequently, the Joads see no option but to seek work in California, described in handbills as fruitful and offering high pay.

The Joads put everything they have into making the journey. Although leaving Oklahoma would violate his parole, Tom decides it is worth the risk, and invites Casy to join him and his family.

Traveling west on Route 66, the Joad family find the road crowded with other migrants. In makeshift camps, they hear many stories from others, some returning from California, and the group worries about lessening prospects. The family dwindles as well: Grandpa dies along the road, and they bury him in a field; Grandma dies close to the California state line; and both Noah (the eldest Joad son) and Connie Rivers (the husband of the pregnant Joad daughter, Rose of Sharon) leave the family. Led by Ma, the remaining members realize they can only continue, as nothing is left for them in Oklahoma.

Reaching California, they find the state oversupplied with labor; wages are low, and workers are exploited to the point of starvation. The big corporate farmers are in collusion and smaller farmers suffer from collapsing prices. Weedpatch Camp, one of the clean, utility-supplied camps operated by the Resettlement Administration, a New Deal agency, offers better conditions but does not have enough resources to care for all the needy families. Nonetheless, as a Federal facility, the camp protects the migrants from harassment by California deputies.

In response to the exploitation, Casy becomes a labor organizer and tries to recruit for a labor union. The remaining Joads work as strikebreakers in a peach orchard, where Casy is involved in a strike that eventually turns violent. When Tom Joad witnesses Casy's fatal beating, he kills the attacker and flees as a fugitive. The Joads later leave the orchard for a cotton farm, where Tom is at risk of being arrested for the homicide.

Tom bids his mother farewell and promises to work for the oppressed. Rose of Sharon's baby is stillborn. Ma Joad remains steadfast and forces the family through the bereavement. With rain, the Joads' dwelling is flooded, and they move to higher ground. In the final chapter of the book, the family takes shelter from the flood in an old barn. Inside they find a young boy and his father, who is dying of starvation. Rose of Sharon takes pity on the man and offers him her breast milk to save him from starvation.",The Grapes Of Wrath (Nobel Prize Winners) (Sold More Than 14 Million Copies),John Steinbeck, , ,Penguin Books Ltd,9780141185064,"1st Published,2000",480,India,English

What is the best that you can do for someone who is mean to you? Give them a dose of their own medicine, of course! George, however, seems to have taken this literally and intends to concoct a magic medicine for his mean old grandma. Yes, that’s right. He’s going to blend in every random ingredient he finds and create a magic medicine out of these substances. No, he’s not stupid. He is going to add brown paint to this mixture to make it look like the original medicine and his horrid grandma will never know the difference. Off he goes into the kitchen and starts putting together all the ingredients. Here is an amusing list of what the medicine contains - deodorant, shampoo, floor polish, horseradish sauce, gin, animal medicines, engine oil, anti-freeze, and finally, the brown paint for colour. When he is done cooking the ingredients, George gives his grandma some of the medicine and waits. Well, something did happen. Something that left George dumbfounded and at awe of his new, marvellous medicine. Can you guess what it might be?

Howard Roark is a brilliant architect who is despised the most for his sheer ability and his disregard for conservatism in architecture. Peter Keating, on the other hand, is a famous, yet an inane architect, who acquires a job in a renowned firm. Although Roark creates remarkable works, they go unnoticed or chided. His association with the fallen hero Henry Cameron doesn’t help him much either. Ellsworth Toohey owns a famous architecture column, whose writing pretty much has the power to make or break an architect’s life. Dominique, although attracted to Roark the very first time she sees him, accuses him of a rape after their brief sexual encounter. Gail Wynand is the editor-in-chief of the famous Banner. The lives of Keating, Wynand, Dominique and Roark become intertwined due to shocking twists and turns that Ayn weaves magically in this book, which was way ahead of its times.

About Ayn Rand

Ayn Rand was a Russian-American writer, novelist, and philosopher who first came up with the philosophical system called Objectivism. She was born in Russia in 1905. She admitted to have started penning screenplays since she was eight years old, as she lacked any interest in going to school. She also started writing novels when she was only ten.

After writing about Greek Gods and demigods, Rick Riordan turned his attention to Egypt for a new series. The Red Pyramid is the first of a series where the main characters are descended from Pharaohs and Egyptian magicians.

Carter Kane is fourteen and he lives and travels around the world with his Egyptologist father, Julius Kane. He has a younger sister Sadie, who is twelve years old. Sadie lives with her grandparents in London. Julius Kane takes Carter to London to visit Sadie and spend time together as a family during Christmas. After picking up Sadie, Julius takes his children to visit the British Museum. On the way, the children see their father speaking to a man they do not know.

At the museum, Julius, who is actually an Egyptian magician, tries to summon the Egyptian God Osiris. In the process he also releases the other Egyptian Gods born on the Demon Days, Horus, Nephthys, Set and Isis. Set imprisons Julius. The stunned children who are witnesses to the incident are taken into custody by the British police. However, they are rescued from further trouble by the mysterious stranger they saw their father talking to some time earlier.

The man turns out to be Amos Kane, their uncle. He takes them to their family home, a huge mansion. He tells them they can explore the house, but to stay out of the library. So, naturally, the two go to the library. Set’s army begins an attack on the mansion. However, Sadie’s cat Muffin, who is actually the cat goddess Bast, saves the children. They later meet Zia Rashid who also helps the kids escape.

They are taken to Egypt, to the House Of Life, to be trained as magicians. But, when the chief of the magicians dies and a new one takes over, the children are seen as a threat and they have to flee.

The Red Pyramid then takes the two children around the world, from Egypt to Paris to Washington, as they try to find a way to stop Set and rescue their father.

The Age Of Reason is based on Sartre’s existential notion of freedom. Existentialism is a branch in philosophy which is concerned with an individual’s existence. According to this school of thought, thinking, feeling, and acting, all begin with the individual subject. This is what gives meaning to life.

Through the choices, dialogues, and psychologies of the characters in the book, Sartre demonstrates how individuals with this philosophy operate in society. Sartre’s story is set in the 1930s, and occurs over a time period of two days.

Mathieu Delarue, a philosophy teacher, is the protagonist of Sartre’s The Age Of Reason. Freedom and being free are the hallmarks of Delarue’s lifestyle. Things go awry when his mistress Marcelle becomes pregnant. Delarue is plunged into a quandary. He contemplates whether giving up his freedom and existential-type life is more important than having a baby. Delarue decides that his freedom is more valuable, and so he urges Marcelle to get an abortion. To further complicate matters, the shadows of World War II begin to loom.

Delarue requires around 4,000 francs in order to have the abortion procedure done. As he tries to gather the money from his friends and family, Marcelle realizes that she wants to have the baby after all. Daniel, a homosexual character in the story, tries to convince her to marry him, just so that she could have her baby. He also secretly desires to see Delarue’s downfall. Even Delarue’s older brother refuses to lend him the money for the procedure, but offers him more than double the amount to wed Marcelle. Delarue’s brother also reminds him that he is no longer youthful and therefore has attained the age of reason. This leaves Delarue wondering whether attaining the age of reason means losing his freedom.

Through Delarue, Sartre forces readers to explore the idea of what it means to achieve freedom from notions such as conformity, material attachments, responsibilities, and even others’ expectations.

In Blink: The Power Of Thinking Without Thinking, Malcolm Gladwell explores the depths of human intuition and how anyone can develop the ability to make quick, yet accurate decisions. These decisions are termed as snap judgements in the book, and the author makes a case for how snap judgements can be more efficient than reasoned decisions, which require deliberation.

The author terms the instinctive side of our mind as the adaptive unconscious. This is the part of the brain that we use for rapid cognition, and for quickly picking out the finer details that matter from among a host of variables.

Blink: The Power Of Thinking Without Thinking isn’t just about the analysis of this phenomenon. Malcolm Gladwell reveals the secret behind using the power of snap judgements in everyday life. He also attempts to detail the different kinds of situations where these decisions are a bad idea, such as the shooting of Amadou Diallo in 1999.

Another phenomenon that the author talks about is called thin slicing. This is the ability to cut out a slice of relevant information from amidst the chaos of information, which presents itself in the first instant that a decision needs to be made. Through studies, he highlights the truth behind whether experts make their best decisions based on instinct or if information analysis still trumps the former.

Conclusions in this book are put forward through a diverse set of examples. The power of intuition is attributed to specific events, like when artists can tell if a historic artifact is fake within an instant, or how a commander used World War II technology to out-maneuver the collective strength of the US armed forces.

Malcolm Gladwell’s writing process revolves around the analysis, interpretation and representation of valuable research. He has earned a place in the minds of his readers as a credible source by shunning personal opinion, and instead relying on research findings to tell the story. As his work tends to rely on scientific research, one of his greatest strengths is his ability to talk about scientific data in a way that anyone can understand.

Malcolm Gladwell was born in Hampshire, England and from the age of 6 he has spent most of his life in Ontario, Canada, where his family relocated.

He has a lot of trouble with his brother, Rodrick, who accidentally caught Greg in a rather embarrassing situation. Desperate to keep things secret, Greg tries hard to ingratiate himself with his brother.

Rodrick does everything possible to make Greg’s life difficult over the summer, but the “wimpy kid” puts up with it all, just so his unfortunate faux-pas doesn’t come to light.

What happens to Rodrick’s band, and his science project? Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules has a number of hilarious situations that make for great reading.

Ezio Auditore continues on the assassin trail, following his training in the prequel Assassin’s Creed Renaissance. What started out as a vendetta for his family’s murder turns out to be fierce battle between the forces of good and evil. Ezio soon finds out that he has bitten off more than he can chew. It’s a one-man army against the ruthless Borgia family.

Ezio’s skills as a master assassin are tested time and again. In a desperate situation, only Ezio’s quick thinking can save his life. Mario continues to play the role of a mentor and guide for Ezio. However, Mario is literally courting death and he seems to be running out of time. There’s still a lot that Mario has to pass on to his prize pupil, Ezio. Will he be able to make it to the end or will the clock stop ticking for him soon? Ezio wields an ancient weapon of power, the apple, which he and Mario managed to secure in The Renaissance. The question that now confronts him is, when and how should he use the apple?

Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood is set in 15th century Rome. The glory of Rome has long evaporated into the now colossal ruins that stand as silent witnesses to the fall of a mighty empire. The degradation hasn’t left the people of Rome unaffected. Torn by strife, hunger, oppression and tyranny of a callous ruler, the people of Rome are living in the shadows of death and privation. Time isn’t a luxury for Ezio, deception and betrayal is rampant even among the closely knit brotherhood. With Cesare Borgia determined to take over all of Italy, can Ezio Auditore be the people’s savior? The fate of Rome now rests in his hands.

""The Sea of Monsters"" by Rick Riordan is the second book in the ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians"" series. In this book, Percy Jackson takes on a quest to save his beloved Camp Half Blood. This book is a tale of Good vs Evil as seen from the point of view of Percy. He must not only fight for the camp but the lives of those around him that he cares about. This book combines the current world with the world of the Greek mythological gods such as Zeus and Poseidon.

Percy Jackson is seen nearing the end of his seventh grade year and although excited about being done with the school, and going to Camp Half Blood for the summer, Percy is concerned about a vivid dream he has had regarding his friend Grover. Percy is not sure what the dream has meant but ultimately decides he has to focus on school. When Percy arrives at school he and his friend, Tyson, are bullied by a group of new boys that have arrived. Tyson tells Percy that the boys have a funny smell and soon the boys begin to develop into large monsters and attack Percy. Tyson comes to Percy's rescue and soon Percy's friend Annabeth also arrives to help and they soon destroy the monsters, and the school.

Percy, Annabeth, and Tyson leave to go to Camp Half-Blood immediately. When they arrive Percy finds that someone has poisoned the magical tree that was created out of Thalia, Zeus' daughter, was injured. Thalia's tree protects Camp Half-Blood but since it is weakened the campers are under constant attack from various monsters. When Percy arrives at Camp he looks at Tyson and realizes he is not a big silly kid, but is in fact a cyclops and in addition to this is also the son of Poseidon, making Tyson Percy's half-brother. Percy and the others at Camp are ordered not go out to find Grover, even though Percy has decided that Grover needs his help and may have a cure for Thalia's tree. Hermes arrives and helps Percy, Tyson, and Annabeth leave camp to go on their quest.

Poseidon sends Hippocampi to assist Percy and the others on the way to find Grover and they soon board a boat manned by a school mate and a crew of dead soldiers. The boat eventually is destroyed in an attempt to reach their destination and Percy believes everyone has died except him and Annabeth. When Percy and Annabeth reach the Island they find that Grover is being held captive by a large Polyphemus, a large cyclops. They are able to rescue Grover and the item that can save Thalia's tree, a golden fleece. While escaping Tyson shows up and helps them evade Polyphemus. When they arrive back at Camp Half-Blood with the golden fleece the tree does revive. Percy has been told of a prophecy that regards a child of the gods although it does not specify which child. It is believed by many that Percy is the only child it could be. When the fleece is put on Thalia's tree Thalia is pulled from the tree, fully recovered. Percy realizes that Thalia could be the child that the prophecy speaks of that could destroy Olympus and that this is the reason the tree had been poisoned.

French philosopher Michel Foucault wrote Discipline And Punish: The Birth Of The Prison, with a view to analyse the various mechanisms that led to significant changes in the penal systems in the West, during the modern ages, while focussing on the French system.

Discipline and Punish: The Birth Of The Prison begins by discussing how the concept of punishment has evolved over time. It chronicles the different types of disciplinary systems in societies, while studying the differences in punishment systems used in the past as compared to modern times.

The book is a gripping body of work, with brilliant, philosophical insights, that suggest a distinct shift in focus of punishment, from the prisoner's body, to his soul, as can be seen from the reforms made, such as abolishing torture, and the evolution of the present day penitentiary system.

The main themes discussed in the book are punishment, torture, discipline, and prison. In the Middle Ages, gaols and dungeons served as prisons, however, punishment was delivered by making it a public spectacle. This early emphasis on public torture, is described in an account of a regicide's excruciatingly slow death, in the mid-eighteenth century. With the passage of time, socio economic and cultural changes called for a better system of control over individuals.

Foucault explains how the Western system of prisons, police organizations, administrative and legal hierarchies, grew in prominence, as a result of the shift of emphasis from the very direct and vengeful forms of punishment, to a much more covert ‘power of discipline’. This power germinated from institutions such as schools, barracks, factories, and hospitals which all commonly exercise control on individuals on an hour-to-hour basis.

Considered a best-selling work of critical and social theory, Foucault’s Discipline And Punish: The Birth Of The Prison, with its numerous editions, is prescribed and studied as a key text for many undergraduate courses across a wide range of disciplines.

Picking up after the events of House of Hades, our heroes are divided into two groups.

The first group is made up of Jason, Piper, and Leo (along with Percy, Annabeth, Frank, and Hazel). They're on the Argo II and they need to make it to the Acropolis stat. That's where Gaea, the Earth Mother, is supposed to awaken, and they need to stop it. (Of course, as goes with prophecies, trying to stop it is totally going to make it happen.)

Our other group is made up of Nico and Reyna who, along with Coach Hedge, are trying to get the Athena Parthenos statue back to Camp Half-Blood as a symbol of truce between Greeks and Romans…and hopefully stop Octavian from launching an onslaught against the camp. 
With Nico's handy dandy shadow-travel ability, they're able to zip between time zones with the statue in tow. They travel through Pompeii, Portugal, a cruise ship in the Atlantic, Puerto Rico, and South Carolina, all exotic locales in their own rights. Along the way, they fight hordes of undead and hordes of werewolves and are pursued by a psychopath named Orion.

In Puerto Rico, Reyna's home, Reyna reluctantly reunites with her sister, Hylla, who wants to use her as bait for Orion. Bad idea. Orion wipes out most of the Hunters of Artemis before Reyna can escape. (Don't worry, sis is fine.) Orion catches up with Reyna near Camp Half-Blood, and Reyna summons her inner strength to defeat him.

As Nico sabotages Octavian's efforts to attack Camp-Half Blood, Reyna delivers the statue just in time…in time for Gaea to awaken, that is. Wait, how did that happen? Let's go back to team one.

Jason, Annabeth, and Piper learn that the strait of Corinth is chock full of death, and they have to go around the entire Peloponnese in order to reach Athens. They're advised to seek out Nike, the goddess of victory, along the way. She mentions yet another prophecy: one of them…will…die. Le gasp! But she advises them to seek out the physician's cure, which can bring someone back to life.

They retrieve the ingredients on their journey. Along the way, Jason is impaled, Percy is poisoned, Annabeth gets really scared, and everyone does battle with a statue demanding to see their health insurance. With the cure in hand, they reach the Parthenon where, yep, they end up feeding into the prophecy. Percy and Annabeth are injured, and their blood awakens Gaea.

Way to go, guys.

Leo flies in on a giant mechanical dragon, hauls Gaea's dirty butt into the sky, and blows her up. He manages to self-administer the cure, which brings him back to life, and he flies to the island of Calypso, the girl he loves.

When Gabriel García Márquez contracted lymphatic cancer in 1999 and published the first volume of his projected three-part autobiography, Living to Tell the Tale (2002), many of his admirers thought this was his swan song, that he would never write fiction again. Now, in Memories of My Melancholy Whores, his first book of fiction in ten years, a novella of a little over one hundred pages, he returns to a fairy-tale form that he has used in short fictions in the past. Some may see this novel as a sort of new breath of life for García Márquez, who seems to have successfully triumphed over his cancer. Others may see it as the perverse dream of an old man who has nothing to look forward to other than death; at the time of the book’s publication, García Márquez was seventy-eight years old. Even before the official publication of Memoria de mis putas tristes in Spain and Latin America, the little book was eagerly anticipated, with street vendors hawking pirated copies. To protect their investment of a million-copy release, the Spanish-language publishers were quick to report that García Márquez had made significant changes at the last minute to the final chapter.

The plot of Memories of My Melancholy Whores is quite simple, summed up in the initial sentence, in which the unnamed, first-person narrator says simply that on his ninetieth birthday he wants to give himself the gift of a riotous night of lovemaking with an adolescent virgin. The remainder of the book recounts the results of this decision by the narrator, a journalist in a Colombian town. The most important result is that the elderly hero does not engage in a night of sexuality with a young girl, but instead sits by her bed, watching her as she sleeps. For the remainder of his ninetieth year he returns to the brothel night after night, continuing to watch the girl sleep, hardly ever touching her and hearing her voice only once. However, he falls helplessly in love with her and, as improbable as it may seem, she ultimately falls in love with him. They finally come together as a most unlikely couple on the last page.

Some critics have chastised the author and the novel’s hero as dirty old men who have no social conscience about the exploitation of young women in developing nations, but it is a misunderstanding of the tradition of Memories of My Melancholy Whores, as well as García Márquez’s obvious intention, to label this a perverted book about an old man’s wicked lust for a teenage girl. As García Márquez has suggested in previous works, visiting a brothel does not have the same unsavory aspect in Colombia as it does in the United States. Indeed, the author of the classic Cien años de soledad (1967; One Hundred Years of Solitude, 1970) has praised the brothels of Bogota, where he studied law, even though he was once beaten up there for failing to pay a prostitute. There is no sordid reality of young women made chattel to men with money in the book. Rather, the story is about enrapt attention, fantasy, the romantic dream of pure ideal love.

Although the protagonist realizes that sex is merely a consolation for not having love, he has never been able to experience love; indeed has never had sex with a woman unless he paid for it. That the final object of his desire is a fourteen-year-old girl has nothing to do with the social issue of preying on the helpless and innocent. Neither love nor sex in this novel has anything to do with social reality; the story is rather a complete romantic idealization of the art-like object of desire. The romantic nature of the old man’s silent observation of the girl as he watches her each night can be compared to the famous metaphor that opens the quintessential Romantic adoration of an untouched objectJohn Keats’s “Ode on a Grecian Urn.” For the young girl in García Márquez’s novel is a frozen work of art, not to be approached if the true nature of ideal romantic love is to be sustained. She is indeed Keats’s “still unravished bride of quietness,” a “foster-child of silence and slow time.” The protagonist knows that he does not want her to awaken, does not want to hear her voice, does not want to see her in daylight but rather wishes only to watch her in silence.",Memories of my Melancholy Whores (Nobel Prize Winner's),Gabriel Garcia Marquez, , ,Penguin Books Ltd,9780241968543,"1st Edition,2014",116,India,English

Readers can rest assured though, the things that they drag out of this abyss is sure to shock and inspire awe. So dive in with them if you’re interested in knowing how much one’s upbringing really matters or how real estate agents and members of the Ku Klux Klan are similar. A word of caution however, the answers Levitt and Dubner give you will definitely shock you.

The narrative begins just after Tom Joad is paroled from McAlester prison, where he had been imprisoned after being convicted of homicide. On his return to his home near Sallisaw, Oklahoma, Tom meets former preacher Jim Casy, whom he remembers from his childhood, and the two travel together. When they arrive at Tom's childhood farm home, they find it deserted. Disconcerted and confused, Tom and Casy meet their old neighbor, Muley Graves, who tells them the family has gone to stay at Uncle John Joad's home nearby. Graves tells them that the banks have evicted all the farmers, but he refuses to leave the area.

The next morning, Tom and Casy go to Uncle John's. Tom finds his family loading their remaining possessions into a Hudson Motor Car Company sedan converted to a truck; with their crops destroyed by the Dust Bowl, the family has defaulted on their bank loans, and their farm has been repossessed. Consequently, the Joads see no option but to seek work in California, described in handbills as fruitful and offering high pay.

The Joads put everything they have into making the journey. Although leaving Oklahoma would violate his parole, Tom decides it is worth the risk, and invites Casy to join him and his family.

Traveling west on Route 66, the Joad family find the road crowded with other migrants. In makeshift camps, they hear many stories from others, some returning from California, and the group worries about lessening prospects. The family dwindles as well: Grandpa dies along the road, and they bury him in a field; Grandma dies close to the California state line; and both Noah (the eldest Joad son) and Connie Rivers (the husband of the pregnant Joad daughter, Rose of Sharon) leave the family. Led by Ma, the remaining members realize they can only continue, as nothing is left for them in Oklahoma.

Reaching California, they find the state oversupplied with labor; wages are low, and workers are exploited to the point of starvation. The big corporate farmers are in collusion and smaller farmers suffer from collapsing prices. Weedpatch Camp, one of the clean, utility-supplied camps operated by the Resettlement Administration, a New Deal agency, offers better conditions but does not have enough resources to care for all the needy families. Nonetheless, as a Federal facility, the camp protects the migrants from harassment by California deputies.

In response to the exploitation, Casy becomes a labor organizer and tries to recruit for a labor union. The remaining Joads work as strikebreakers in a peach orchard, where Casy is involved in a strike that eventually turns violent. When Tom Joad witnesses Casy's fatal beating, he kills the attacker and flees as a fugitive. The Joads later leave the orchard for a cotton farm, where Tom is at risk of being arrested for the homicide.

Tom bids his mother farewell and promises to work for the oppressed. Rose of Sharon's baby is stillborn. Ma Joad remains steadfast and forces the family through the bereavement. With rain, the Joads' dwelling is flooded, and they move to higher ground. In the final chapter of the book, the family takes shelter from the flood in an old barn. Inside they find a young boy and his father, who is dying of starvation.

Howard Roark is a brilliant architect who is despised the most for his sheer ability and his disregard for conservatism in architecture. Peter Keating, on the other hand, is a famous, yet an inane architect, who acquires a job in a renowned firm. Although Roark creates remarkable works, they go unnoticed or chided. His association with the fallen hero Henry Cameron doesn’t help him much either. Ellsworth Toohey owns a famous architecture column, whose writing pretty much has the power to make or break an architect’s life. Dominique, although attracted to Roark the very first time she sees him, accuses him of a rape after their brief sexual encounter. Gail Wynand is the editor-in-chief of the famous Banner. The lives of Keating, Wynand, Dominique and Roark become intertwined due to shocking twists and turns that Ayn weaves magically in this book, which was way ahead of its times.

About Ayn Rand

Ayn Rand was a Russian-American writer, novelist, and philosopher who first came up with the philosophical system called Objectivism. She was born in Russia in 1905. She admitted to have started penning screenplays since she was eight years old, as she lacked any interest in going to school. She also started writing novels when she was only ten.

After high school, she came back to Saint Petersburg, her birth place, and joined the Petrograd State University. She studied social pedagogy and history there. Ayn also studied at the State Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad for a year, after which she evolved her philosophy, Objectivism.

After writing about Greek Gods and demigods, Rick Riordan turned his attention to Egypt for a new series. The Red Pyramid is the first of a series where the main characters are descended from Pharaohs and Egyptian magicians.

Carter Kane is fourteen and he lives and travels around the world with his Egyptologist father, Julius Kane. He has a younger sister Sadie, who is twelve years old. Sadie lives with her grandparents in London. Julius Kane takes Carter to London to visit Sadie and spend time together as a family during Christmas. After picking up Sadie, Julius takes his children to visit the British Museum. On the way, the children see their father speaking to a man they do not know.

At the museum, Julius, who is actually an Egyptian magician, tries to summon the Egyptian God Osiris. In the process he also releases the other Egyptian Gods born on the Demon Days, Horus, Nephthys, Set and Isis. Set imprisons Julius. The stunned children who are witnesses to the incident are taken into custody by the British police. However, they are rescued from further trouble by the mysterious stranger they saw their father talking to some time earlier.

The man turns out to be Amos Kane, their uncle. He takes them to their family home, a huge mansion. He tells them they can explore the house, but to stay out of the library. So, naturally, the two go to the library. Set’s army begins an attack on the mansion. However, Sadie’s cat Muffin, who is actually the cat goddess Bast, saves the children. They later meet Zia Rashid who also helps the kids escape.

They are taken to Egypt, to the House Of Life, to be trained as magicians. But, when the chief of the magicians dies and a new one takes over, the children are seen as a threat and they have to flee.

The Red Pyramid then takes the two children around the world, from Egypt to Paris to Washington, as they try to find a way to stop Set and rescue their father.

The Age Of Reason is based on Sartre’s existential notion of freedom. Existentialism is a branch in philosophy which is concerned with an individual’s existence. According to this school of thought, thinking, feeling, and acting, all begin with the individual subject. This is what gives meaning to life.

Through the choices, dialogues, and psychologies of the characters in the book, Sartre demonstrates how individuals with this philosophy operate in society. Sartre’s story is set in the 1930s, and occurs over a time period of two days.

Mathieu Delarue, a philosophy teacher, is the protagonist of Sartre’s The Age Of Reason. Freedom and being free are the hallmarks of Delarue’s lifestyle. Things go awry when his mistress Marcelle becomes pregnant. Delarue is plunged into a quandary. He contemplates whether giving up his freedom and existential-type life is more important than having a baby. Delarue decides that his freedom is more valuable, and so he urges Marcelle to get an abortion. To further complicate matters, the shadows of World War II begin to loom.

Delarue requires around 4,000 francs in order to have the abortion procedure done. As he tries to gather the money from his friends and family, Marcelle realizes that she wants to have the baby after all. Daniel, a homosexual character in the story, tries to convince her to marry him, just so that she could have her baby. He also secretly desires to see Delarue’s downfall. Even Delarue’s older brother refuses to lend him the money for the procedure, but offers him more than double the amount to wed Marcelle. Delarue’s brother also reminds him that he is no longer youthful and therefore has attained the age of reason. This leaves Delarue wondering whether attaining the age of reason means losing his freedom.

Through Delarue, Sartre forces readers to explore the idea of what it means to achieve freedom from notions such as conformity, material attachments, responsibilities, and even others’ expectations. Although the notion of freedom might mean different things to different people, the notion might simply be an abstract one rather than something that truly exists.

The Age Of Reason was first published in 1945.

In Blink: The Power Of Thinking Without Thinking, Malcolm Gladwell explores the depths of human intuition and how anyone can develop the ability to make quick, yet accurate decisions. These decisions are termed as snap judgements in the book, and the author makes a case for how snap judgements can be more efficient than reasoned decisions, which require deliberation.

The author terms the instinctive side of our mind as the adaptive unconscious. This is the part of the brain that we use for rapid cognition, and for quickly picking out the finer details that matter from among a host of variables.

Blink: The Power Of Thinking Without Thinking isn’t just about the analysis of this phenomenon. Malcolm Gladwell reveals the secret behind using the power of snap judgements in everyday life. He also attempts to detail the different kinds of situations where these decisions are a bad idea, such as the shooting of Amadou Diallo in 1999.

Another phenomenon that the author talks about is called thin slicing. This is the ability to cut out a slice of relevant information from amidst the chaos of information, which presents itself in the first instant that a decision needs to be made. Through studies, he highlights the truth behind whether experts make their best decisions based on instinct or if information analysis still trumps the former.

Conclusions in this book are put forward through a diverse set of examples. The power of intuition is attributed to specific events, like when artists can tell if a historic artifact is fake within an instant, or how a commander used World War II technology to out-maneuver the collective strength of the US armed forces.

Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules begins with the protagonist, Greg, complaining about how bad his summer holidays were. He has a lot of trouble with his brother, Rodrick, who accidentally caught Greg in a rather embarrassing situation. Desperate to keep things secret, Greg tries hard to ingratiate himself with his brother.

Rodrick does everything possible to make Greg’s life difficult over the summer, but the “wimpy kid” puts up with it all, just so his unfortunate faux-pas doesn’t come to light. When their mother finds out that they are always short on cash, she starts a “Mom Bucks” scheme, giving both the children money. Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules has a great combination of hard-luck situations that readers can relate to.

While Rodrick spends it all on rock magazines, Greg carefully saves up, but still ends up losing all his money owing to unfortunate circumstances (and his big brother Rodrick, of course). Rodrick has a science project coming up, but is more interested in playing with his band, the Loded Diper, in an upcoming show.

Amidst getting grounded by his parents and bullied by his brother, Greg Heffley has a lot on his mind. Does he manage to keep his secret, or does Rodrick ultimately spill the beans? What happens to Rodrick’s band, and his science project? Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules has a number of hilarious situations that make for great reading.

Ezio Auditore continues on the assassin trail, following his training in the prequel Assassin’s Creed Renaissance. What started out as a vendetta for his family’s murder turns out to be fierce battle between the forces of good and evil. Ezio soon finds out that he has bitten off more than he can chew. It’s a one-man army against the ruthless Borgia family.

Ezio’s skills as a master assassin are tested time and again. In a desperate situation, only Ezio’s quick thinking can save his life. Mario continues to play the role of a mentor and guide for Ezio. However, Mario is literally courting death and he seems to be running out of time. There’s still a lot that Mario has to pass on to his prize pupil, Ezio. Will he be able to make it to the end or will the clock stop ticking for him soon? Ezio wields an ancient weapon of power, the apple, which he and Mario managed to secure in The Renaissance. The question that now confronts him is, when and how should he use the apple?

Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood is set in 15th century Rome. The glory of Rome has long evaporated into the now colossal ruins that stand as silent witnesses to the fall of a mighty empire. The degradation hasn’t left the people of Rome unaffected. Torn by strife, hunger, oppression and tyranny of a callous ruler, the people of Rome are living in the shadows of death and privation. Time isn’t a luxury for Ezio, deception and betrayal is rampant even among the closely knit brotherhood. With Cesare Borgia determined to take over all of Italy, can Ezio Auditore be the people’s savior? The fate of Rome now rests in his hands.

""The Sea of Monsters"" by Rick Riordan is the second book in the ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians"" series. In this book, Percy Jackson takes on a quest to save his beloved Camp Half Blood. This book is a tale of Good vs Evil as seen from the point of view of Percy. He must not only fight for the camp but the lives of those around him that he cares about. This book combines the current world with the world of the Greek mythological gods such as Zeus and Poseidon.

Percy Jackson is seen nearing the end of his seventh grade year and although excited about being done with the school, and going to Camp Half Blood for the summer, Percy is concerned about a vivid dream he has had regarding his friend Grover. Percy is not sure what the dream has meant but ultimately decides he has to focus on school. When Percy arrives at school he and his friend, Tyson, are bullied by a group of new boys that have arrived. Tyson tells Percy that the boys have a funny smell and soon the boys begin to develop into large monsters and attack Percy. Tyson comes to Percy's rescue and soon Percy's friend Annabeth also arrives to help and they soon destroy the monsters, and the school.

Percy, Annabeth, and Tyson leave to go to Camp Half-Blood immediately. When they arrive Percy finds that someone has poisoned the magical tree that was created out of Thalia, Zeus' daughter, was injured. Thalia's tree protects Camp Half-Blood but since it is weakened the campers are under constant attack from various monsters. When Percy arrives at Camp he looks at Tyson and realizes he is not a big silly kid, but is in fact a cyclops and in addition to this is also the son of Poseidon, making Tyson Percy's half-brother. Percy and the others at Camp are ordered not go out to find Grover, even though Percy has decided that Grover needs his help and may have a cure for Thalia's tree. Hermes arrives and helps Percy, Tyson, and Annabeth leave camp to go on their quest.

Poseidon sends Hippocampi to assist Percy and the others on the way to find Grover and they soon board a boat manned by a school mate and a crew of dead soldiers. The boat eventually is destroyed in an attempt to reach their destination and Percy believes everyone has died except him and Annabeth. When Percy and Annabeth reach the Island they find that Grover is being held captive by a large Polyphemus, a large cyclops. They are able to rescue Grover and the item that can save Thalia's tree, a golden fleece. While escaping Tyson shows up and helps them evade Polyphemus. When they arrive back at Camp Half-Blood with the golden fleece the tree does revive. Percy has been told of a prophecy that regards a child of the gods although it does not specify which child. It is believed by many that Percy is the only child it could be. When the fleece is put on Thalia's tree Thalia is pulled from the tree, fully recovered. Percy realizes that Thalia could be the child that the prophecy speaks of that could destroy Olympus and that this is the reason the tree had been poisoned.

French philosopher Michel Foucault wrote Discipline And Punish: The Birth Of The Prison, with a view to analyse the various mechanisms that led to significant changes in the penal systems in the West, during the modern ages, while focussing on the French system.

Discipline and Punish: The Birth Of The Prison begins by discussing how the concept of punishment has evolved over time. It chronicles the different types of disciplinary systems in societies, while studying the differences in punishment systems used in the past as compared to modern times.

The book is a gripping body of work, with brilliant, philosophical insights, that suggest a distinct shift in focus of punishment, from the prisoner's body, to his soul, as can be seen from the reforms made, such as abolishing torture, and the evolution of the present day penitentiary system.

The main themes discussed in the book are punishment, torture, discipline, and prison. In the Middle Ages, gaols and dungeons served as prisons, however, punishment was delivered by making it a public spectacle. This early emphasis on public torture, is described in an account of a regicide's excruciatingly slow death, in the mid-eighteenth century. With the passage of time, socio economic and cultural changes called for a better system of control over individuals.

Foucault explains how the Western system of prisons, police organizations, administrative and legal hierarchies, grew in prominence, as a result of the shift of emphasis from the very direct and vengeful forms of punishment, to a much more covert ‘power of discipline’. This power germinated from institutions such as schools, barracks, factories, and hospitals which all commonly exercise control on individuals on an hour-to-hour basis.

Considered a best-selling work of critical and social theory, Foucault’s Discipline And Punish: The Birth Of The Prison, with its numerous editions, is prescribed and studied as a key text for many undergraduate courses across a wide range of disciplines.

Picking up after the events of House of Hades, our heroes are divided into two groups.

The first group is made up of Jason, Piper, and Leo (along with Percy, Annabeth, Frank, and Hazel). They're on the Argo II and they need to make it to the Acropolis stat. That's where Gaea, the Earth Mother, is supposed to awaken, and they need to stop it. (Of course, as goes with prophecies, trying to stop it is totally going to make it happen.)

Our other group is made up of Nico and Reyna who, along with Coach Hedge, are trying to get the Athena Parthenos statue back to Camp Half-Blood as a symbol of truce between Greeks and Romans…and hopefully stop Octavian from launching an onslaught against the camp. 
With Nico's handy dandy shadow-travel ability, they're able to zip between time zones with the statue in tow. They travel through Pompeii, Portugal, a cruise ship in the Atlantic, Puerto Rico, and South Carolina, all exotic locales in their own rights. Along the way, they fight hordes of undead and hordes of werewolves and are pursued by a psychopath named Orion.

In Puerto Rico, Reyna's home, Reyna reluctantly reunites with her sister, Hylla, who wants to use her as bait for Orion. Bad idea. Orion wipes out most of the Hunters of Artemis before Reyna can escape. (Don't worry, sis is fine.) Orion catches up with Reyna near Camp Half-Blood, and Reyna summons her inner strength to defeat him.

As Nico sabotages Octavian's efforts to attack Camp-Half Blood, Reyna delivers the statue just in time…in time for Gaea to awaken, that is. Wait, how did that happen? Let's go back to team one.

Jason, Annabeth, and Piper learn that the strait of Corinth is chock full of death, and they have to go around the entire Peloponnese in order to reach Athens. They're advised to seek out Nike, the goddess of victory, along the way. She mentions yet another prophecy: one of them…will…die. Le gasp! But she advises them to seek out the physician's cure, which can bring someone back to life.

They retrieve the ingredients on their journey. Along the way, Jason is impaled, Percy is poisoned, Annabeth gets really scared, and everyone does battle with a statue demanding to see their health insurance. With the cure in hand, they reach the Parthenon where, yep, they end up feeding into the prophecy. Percy and Annabeth are injured, and their blood awakens Gaea.

Way to go, guys.

Leo flies in on a giant mechanical dragon, hauls Gaea's dirty butt into the sky, and blows her up. He manages to self-administer the cure, which brings him back to life, and he flies to the island of Calypso, the girl he loves.

When Gabriel García Márquez contracted lymphatic cancer in 1999 and published the first volume of his projected three-part autobiography, Living to Tell the Tale (2002), many of his admirers thought this was his swan song, that he would never write fiction again. Now, in Memories of My Melancholy Whores, his first book of fiction in ten years, a novella of a little over one hundred pages, he returns to a fairy-tale form that he has used in short fictions in the past. Some may see this novel as a sort of new breath of life for García Márquez, who seems to have successfully triumphed over his cancer. Others may see it as the perverse dream of an old man who has nothing to look forward to other than death; at the time of the book’s publication, García Márquez was seventy-eight years old. Even before the official publication of Memoria de mis putas tristes in Spain and Latin America, the little book was eagerly anticipated, with street vendors hawking pirated copies. To protect their investment of a million-copy release, the Spanish-language publishers were quick to report that García Márquez had made significant changes at the last minute to the final chapter.

The plot of Memories of My Melancholy Whores is quite simple, summed up in the initial sentence, in which the unnamed, first-person narrator says simply that on his ninetieth birthday he wants to give himself the gift of a riotous night of lovemaking with an adolescent virgin. The remainder of the book recounts the results of this decision by the narrator, a journalist in a Colombian town. The most important result is that the elderly hero does not engage in a night of sexuality with a young girl, but instead sits by her bed, watching her as she sleeps. For the remainder of his ninetieth year he returns to the brothel night after night, continuing to watch the girl sleep, hardly ever touching her and hearing her voice only once. However, he falls helplessly in love with her and, as improbable as it may seem, she ultimately falls in love with him. They finally come together as a most unlikely couple on the last page.

Some critics have chastised the author and the novel’s hero as dirty old men who have no social conscience about the exploitation of young women in developing nations, but it is a misunderstanding of the tradition of Memories of My Melancholy Whores, as well as García Márquez’s obvious intention, to label this a perverted book about an old man’s wicked lust for a teenage girl. As García Márquez has suggested in previous works, visiting a brothel does not have the same unsavory aspect in Colombia as it does in the United States. Indeed, the author of the classic Cien años de soledad (1967; One Hundred Years of Solitude, 1970) has praised the brothels of Bogota, where he studied law, even though he was once beaten up there for failing to pay a prostitute. There is no sordid reality of young women made chattel to men with money in the book. Rather, the story is about enrapt attention, fantasy, the romantic dream of pure ideal love.

Although the protagonist realizes that sex is merely a consolation for not having love, he has never been able to experience love; indeed has never had sex with a woman unless he paid for it. That the final object of his desire is a fourteen-year-old girl has nothing to do with the social issue of preying on the helpless and innocent. Neither love nor sex in this novel has anything to do with social reality; the story is rather a complete romantic idealization of the art-like object of desire. The romantic nature of the old man’s silent observation of the girl as he watches her each night can be compared to the famous metaphor that opens the quintessential Romantic adoration of an untouched objectJohn Keats’s “Ode on a Grecian Urn.” For the young girl in García Márquez’s novel is a frozen work of art, not to be approached if the true nature of ideal romantic love is to be sustained. She is indeed Keats’s “still unravished bride of quietness,” a “foster-child of silence and slow time.” The protagonist knows that he does not want her to awaken, does not want to hear her voice, does not want to see her in daylight but rather wishes only to watch her in silence.",Memories of my Melancholy Whores (Nobel Prize Winner's),Gabriel Garcia Marquez, , ,Penguin Books Ltd,9780241968543,"1st Edition,2014",116,India,English

What’s more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? Did you think it was a gun? Well, statistics proves you wrong. Did you know that schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have something in common?

Numbers make no sense to laymen, but when he first revealed his ideas on the relationship between abortion and the drop in crime rates, people began to take notice. Numbers can predict many things, and when read right they can also explain many others. Stephen Dubner teams up with Steven D. Levitt to jump head first into the intimidating sea of numbers. Readers can rest assured though, the things that they drag out of this abyss is sure to shock and inspire awe. So dive in with them if you’re interested in knowing how much one’s upbringing really matters or how real estate agents and members of the Ku Klux Klan are similar. A word of caution however, the answers Levitt and Dubner give you will definitely shock you.

Time travel was the one discovery people had been waiting for. However, despite being so simple, it was only natural that others would seek to use it for criminal means. Fortunately, those who dare mess with the Time Space continuum have someone to reckon with: the TimeRiders. Torn from their own timelines as they’re about to die, they have been granted a new life by a secret agency that doesn’t exist. Liam O’Connor, Maddy Carter and Sal Vikram are charged with policing those who would misuse the powers of time travel for their own ends. Theirs is a simple job. If someone dares mess with time, it is their responsibility to stop them from destroying the world and all the future.

The narrative begins just after Tom Joad is paroled from McAlester prison, where he had been imprisoned after being convicted of homicide. On his return to his home near Sallisaw, Oklahoma, Tom meets former preacher Jim Casy, whom he remembers from his childhood, and the two travel together. When they arrive at Tom's childhood farm home, they find it deserted. Disconcerted and confused, Tom and Casy meet their old neighbor, Muley Graves, who tells them the family has gone to stay at Uncle John Joad's home nearby. Graves tells them that the banks have evicted all the farmers, but he refuses to leave the area.

The next morning, Tom and Casy go to Uncle John's. Tom finds his family loading their remaining possessions into a Hudson Motor Car Company sedan converted to a truck; with their crops destroyed by the Dust Bowl, the family has defaulted on their bank loans, and their farm has been repossessed. Consequently, the Joads see no option but to seek work in California, described in handbills as fruitful and offering high pay.

The Joads put everything they have into making the journey. Although leaving Oklahoma would violate his parole, Tom decides it is worth the risk, and invites Casy to join him and his family.

Traveling west on Route 66, the Joad family find the road crowded with other migrants. In makeshift camps, they hear many stories from others, some returning from California, and the group worries about lessening prospects. The family dwindles as well: Grandpa dies along the road, and they bury him in a field; Grandma dies close to the California state line; and both Noah (the eldest Joad son) and Connie Rivers (the husband of the pregnant Joad daughter, Rose of Sharon) leave the family. Led by Ma, the remaining members realize they can only continue, as nothing is left for them in Oklahoma.

Reaching California, they find the state oversupplied with labor; wages are low, and workers are exploited to the point of starvation. The big corporate farmers are in collusion and smaller farmers suffer from collapsing prices. Weedpatch Camp, one of the clean, utility-supplied camps operated by the Resettlement Administration, a New Deal agency, offers better conditions but does not have enough resources to care for all the needy families. Nonetheless, as a Federal facility, the camp protects the migrants from harassment by California deputies.

In response to the exploitation, Casy becomes a labor organizer and tries to recruit for a labor union. The remaining Joads work as strikebreakers in a peach orchard, where Casy is involved in a strike that eventually turns violent. When Tom Joad witnesses Casy's fatal beating, he kills the attacker and flees as a fugitive. The Joads later leave the orchard for a cotton farm, where Tom is at risk of being arrested for the homicide.

Tom bids his mother farewell and promises to work for the oppressed. Rose of Sharon's baby is stillborn. Ma Joad remains steadfast and forces the family through the bereavement. With rain, the Joads' dwelling is flooded, and they move to higher ground. In the final chapter of the book, the family takes shelter from the flood in an old barn. Inside they find a young boy and his father, who is dying of starvation.

What is the best that you can do for someone who is mean to you? Give them a dose of their own medicine, of course! George, however, seems to have taken this literally and intends to concoct a magic medicine for his mean old grandma. Yes, that’s right. He’s going to blend in every random ingredient he finds and create a magic medicine out of these substances. No, he’s not stupid. He is going to add brown paint to this mixture to make it look like the original medicine and his horrid grandma will never know the difference. Off he goes into the kitchen and starts putting together all the ingredients. Here is an amusing list of what the medicine contains - deodorant, shampoo, floor polish, horseradish sauce, gin, animal medicines, engine oil, anti-freeze, and finally, the brown paint for colour. When he is done cooking the ingredients, George gives his grandma some of the medicine and waits. Well, something did happen. Something that left George dumbfounded and at awe of his new, marvellous medicine. Can you guess what it might be?

Howard Roark is a brilliant architect who is despised the most for his sheer ability and his disregard for conservatism in architecture. Peter Keating, on the other hand, is a famous, yet an inane architect, who acquires a job in a renowned firm. Although Roark creates remarkable works, they go unnoticed or chided. His association with the fallen hero Henry Cameron doesn’t help him much either. Ellsworth Toohey owns a famous architecture column, whose writing pretty much has the power to make or break an architect’s life. Dominique, although attracted to Roark the very first time she sees him, accuses him of a rape after their brief sexual encounter. Gail Wynand is the editor-in-chief of the famous Banner. The lives of Keating, Wynand, Dominique and Roark become intertwined due to shocking twists and turns that Ayn weaves magically in this book, which was way ahead of its times. Grab a copy of The Fountainhead and treat yourself to one of the most riveting reads a novel could ever offer!

About Ayn Rand

Ayn Rand was a Russian-American writer, novelist, and philosopher who first came up with the philosophical system called Objectivism. She was born in Russia in 1905.

After high school, she came back to Saint Petersburg, her birth place, and joined the Petrograd State University. She studied social pedagogy and history there. Ayn also studied at the State Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad for a year, after which she evolved her philosophy, Objectivism.

After writing about Greek Gods and demigods, Rick Riordan turned his attention to Egypt for a new series. The Red Pyramid is the first of a series where the main characters are descended from Pharaohs and Egyptian magicians.

Carter Kane is fourteen and he lives and travels around the world with his Egyptologist father, Julius Kane. He has a younger sister Sadie, who is twelve years old. Sadie lives with her grandparents in London. Julius Kane takes Carter to London to visit Sadie and spend time together as a family during Christmas. After picking up Sadie, Julius takes his children to visit the British Museum. On the way, the children see their father speaking to a man they do not know.

At the museum, Julius, who is actually an Egyptian magician, tries to summon the Egyptian God Osiris. In the process he also releases the other Egyptian Gods born on the Demon Days, Horus, Nephthys, Set and Isis. Set imprisons Julius. The stunned children who are witnesses to the incident are taken into custody by the British police. However, they are rescued from further trouble by the mysterious stranger they saw their father talking to some time earlier.

The man turns out to be Amos Kane, their uncle. He takes them to their family home, a huge mansion. He tells them they can explore the house, but to stay out of the library. So, naturally, the two go to the library. Set’s army begins an attack on the mansion. However, Sadie’s cat Muffin, who is actually the cat goddess Bast, saves the children. They later meet Zia Rashid who also helps the kids escape.

They are taken to Egypt, to the House Of Life, to be trained as magicians. But, when the chief of the magicians dies and a new one takes over, the children are seen as a threat and they have to flee.

The Red Pyramid then takes the two children around the world, from Egypt to Paris to Washington, as they try to find a way to stop Set and rescue their father.

The Age Of Reason is based on Sartre’s existential notion of freedom. Existentialism is a branch in philosophy which is concerned with an individual’s existence. According to this school of thought, thinking, feeling, and acting, all begin with the individual subject. This is what gives meaning to life.

Through the choices, dialogues, and psychologies of the characters in the book, Sartre demonstrates how individuals with this philosophy operate in society. Sartre’s story is set in the 1930s, and occurs over a time period of two days.

Mathieu Delarue, a philosophy teacher, is the protagonist of Sartre’s The Age Of Reason. Freedom and being free are the hallmarks of Delarue’s lifestyle. Things go awry when his mistress Marcelle becomes pregnant. Delarue is plunged into a quandary. He contemplates whether giving up his freedom and existential-type life is more important than having a baby. Delarue decides that his freedom is more valuable, and so he urges Marcelle to get an abortion. To further complicate matters, the shadows of World War II begin to loom.

Delarue requires around 4,000 francs in order to have the abortion procedure done. As he tries to gather the money from his friends and family, Marcelle realizes that she wants to have the baby after all. Daniel, a homosexual character in the story, tries to convince her to marry him, just so that she could have her baby. He also secretly desires to see Delarue’s downfall. Even Delarue’s older brother refuses to lend him the money for the procedure, but offers him more than double the amount to wed Marcelle. Delarue’s brother also reminds him that he is no longer youthful and therefore has attained the age of reason. This leaves Delarue wondering whether attaining the age of reason means losing his freedom.

Through Delarue, Sartre forces readers to explore the idea of what it means to achieve freedom from notions such as conformity, material attachments, responsibilities, and even others’ expectations. Although the notion of freedom might mean different things to different people, the notion might simply be an abstract one rather than something that truly exists.

The Age Of Reason was first published in 1945.

His first attempt ends in a nasty bump on the head, and Max finds when he tries to speak his words are all mixed up.
