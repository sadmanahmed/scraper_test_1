In Covent Garden, the Eynsford Hills wait for a cab in the rain. When Freddy goes to hail one, he knocks Liza's flowers out of her basket. She accepts money from Freddy's mother, then Colonel Pickering. A bystander warns her that a man is writing down what she is saying, and she confronts him, saying that she has done nothing wrong. Higgins amazes the crowd by imitating her accent and guessing where they all come from. Pickering and Higgins meet and agree to have dinner, and Higgins fills Liza's basket with money before he leaves. Liza leaves in a cab.

The next day, Liza intrudes upon Pickering and Higgins in Higgins's home. She wants English lessons, and Pickering bets that Higgins could not pass her off as a lady at the ambassador's ball in a month's time. Mrs. Pearce takes Liza away to bathe her and dress her more appropriately, and Liza's father arrives and demands some payment. Higgins likes him and gives him five pounds.

A few months later, Mrs. Higgins is writing letters at home when she is interrupted by her son, who shocks her by telling her that he is bringing a flower-girl to his house. The Eynsford Hills arrive for a visit, as does Eliza--with her newly elegant accent and manner. Freddy is infatuated right away. Eliza makes the mistake of swearing and describing her aunt's alcoholism, and she is hustled away by Higgins. Clara thinks that swearing is the new fashion and shocks her mother by saying ""bloody"" on the way out. Mrs. Higgins scolds Pickering and her son for not considering what is to be done with Eliza after the experiment.

At midnight at Higgins's house, Eliza enters looking exhausted. Higgins ignores her, looking for his slippers and crowing over her success at fooling everyone as his own. Eliza begins to look furious. When Higgins asks where his slippers are, Eliza throws them at his face. She explains that she does not know what to do with herself now that Higgins has transformed her. He suggests that she marry, to which she responds that she used to be something better than a prostitute when she sold flowers. She throws the ring that he gave her into the fireplace, and he loses his temper at her and leaves the room. She looks for the ring in the ashes.

Mrs. Higgins is in her drawing room when her son comes and tells her that Eliza has run away. Doolittle arrives and announces that after he spoke with Higgins, Higgins recommended him as a speaker to an American millionaire who died and left him everything. Doolittle is now middle-class and hating every minute of it; his mistress is forcing him to marry her that afternoon. Eliza comes downstairs (she ran away to Mrs. Higgins's house), and Higgins looks flabbergasted. Doolittle invites Pickering and Mrs. Higgins to the wedding, and they leave Eliza and Higgins alone to talk. Eliza says that she does not want to be treated like a pair of slippers--and Freddy writes her love letters every day. When she threatens to become a phonetics teacher herself and use Higgins's methods, he says that he likes the new, stronger version of Eliza. He wants to live with her and Pickering as ""three bachelors.""

Mrs. Higgins returns dressed for the wedding, and she takes Eliza with her. Higgins asks her to run his errands for him, including that of buying some cheese and ham. She says a final goodbye to him, and he seems confident that she will follow his command.

The onstage drama ends, and Shaw narrates, in an epilogue, that Eliza recognizes Higgins as predestined to be a bachelor; she marries Freddy instead. With a gift from Colonel Pickering, Eliza opens a flower shop. The only person truly bothered by this state of affairs is Clara, who decides that the marriage will not help her own marriage prospects. But then she begins to read H.G. Wells and travel in the circles of his fans, and she is convinced to begin working in a furniture shop herself in the hopes that she might meet Wells (because the woman who owns the shop is also a fan of his). Freddy is not very practical, and he and Eliza must take classes in bookkeeping to make their business a success. They do reach success, and they live a fairly comfortable life.

The book was first published in 1869 and is widely considered as Leo Tolstoy’s magnum opus.    
Summary Of The Book:  
Originally written in Russian, War And Peace has been translated into a number of languages, including English. The novel, though one of the longest ever written, is a must read for every literature enthusiast. The novel is set in the early 19th century and revolves around the French invasion of Russia by Napoleon.
War And Peace is truly an epic in itself and is divided into four volumes and has an epilogue in two parts. Most of the characters of the large cast are introduced early, at a social party in St. Petersburg. While the novel is fictional in nature, it does include some historical facts and figures, such as Alexander I and Napoleon, and the French Invasion of Russia in 1812 and the Napoleonic Wars. The novel takes us on an unforgettable journey as we encounter various characters in search of love amidst war and peace.
The novel’s plot can be seen from two different perspectives. First, it depicts the Napoleonic invasion of Russia, and the Russian war efforts to defeat the French. The other plot is mainly concerned with the personal dramas of five aristocratic families, particularly the Bolkonskys, the Bezukhovs, and the Rostovs. The novel follows these representatives of the Russian aristocracy, as they build their lives in a war torn empire.
The principal characters of the novel are three young aristocrats, Pierre, Andrei and Natasha. While the novel focuses on the aristocracy, the peasantry and the soldiers are given ample voice throughout. War And Peace is not just a novel about human emotions, frailties and history, but it is also a discourse on Tolstoy’s philosophies. The later part of the novel includes many sections that throw light on Tolstoy’s philosophical ideologies.

Elizabeth Bennet is an unpolished girl from the country. Despite being one of the five daughters of an English gentleman, she is unused to the behaviour of the gentry. When she attends a ball, she notices a dashing young man called Fitzwilliam Darcy. She immediately takes him for a conceited and arrogant man, and the fact that Darcy is deeply involved in the troubled relationship between his friend and Elizabeth’s sister makes her hate him even more. However, in a series of comic events which poke fun at the gentile society and the life of people in the middle class during Jane Austen’s era, this story brings Elizabeth and Darcy closer. This edition also includes a new chronology to help readers understand the characters and the timeline, as well as the original Penguin Publications’ introduction written by Tony Tanner.

A vital cornerstone to Marx's overall theory of economics, the second volume of Capital considers in depth the nature of commodity and the market-place in bourgeois society. Exploring the manner in which capitalist society must lead inevitably to a 'spiralling movement of unbalanced growth and social crisis, it argues forcefully that the mass, production of goods distributed rapidly around the globe causes wealth to be placed increasingly in the hands of the few, at the expense of the basic human needs of the many. As Marx also shows here, a thriving capitalist society necessarily tends towards overproduction, leading to vast economic convulsions. This immensely powerful work argues that prosperity in a capitalist society inevitably holds within itself the seeds of its own destruction.
David Fernbach's translation captures the clarity and brilliance of Marx's original work. The introduction, by Ernest Mandel, explores the position of the volume as part of the wider work, explains Marxist thought and considers its long-term influence.",Capital:  A Critique of Political Economy (Volume II),Karl Marx, , ,Penguin Classics,9780140445695,"Reprint,1992",624,India,English

Summary of the Book


The best of times, the worst of times, the age of wisdom, the age of foolishness, the epoch of belief, the epoch of incredulity, the season of Light, the season of Darkness, the spring of hope, the winter of despair, having everything, yet nothing, leading to heaven, yet leading to the other way, the time of the French Revolution was all this and more. In this setting Dickens begins his most famous work, telling the story of the French peasantry demoralised by the French aristocracy in the years leading up to the revolution. Principally the story of Sidney Carton and Lucie Manette, this book follows them and the villainous Madame Defarge to tell a story of darkness, love, forgiveness, revenge and self-sacrifice.

""The Idiot"" is Fyodor Dostoyevsky's 1868 novel which tells the story of Prince Lyov Nikolayevich Myshkin who, after a long absence, returns to Russia from Switzerland where he sought treatment for his epilepsy. The story is primarily a tragic tale of the struggle for the love of a woman, Nastasya Filippovna, between Myshkin and Rogozhin, a dark and impassioned man that the Prince meets on the train to St. Petersburg. ""The Idiot"" is a classic tale of the conflict between good and evil. On the one hand Prince Myshkin represents Dostoyevksy's attempt to portray a Christ-like ""positively good man"" which is sharply contrasted with not only the dark and roguish character of Rogozhin but also with the nature of Russian upper-class society depicted in the novel.",The Idiot,Fyodor Dostoyevsky, , ,Penguin Classics,9780140447927,"1st Edition,2004",732,India,English

INTRODUCTION
At 4 p.m. on a hazy, humid winter's afternoon in Rangoon in November 1862, soon after the end of the monsoon, a shrouded corpse was escorted by a small group of British soldiers to an anonymous grave at the back of a walled prison enclosure.
This enclosure lay overlooking the muddy brown waters of the Rangoon river, a little downhill from the great gilt spire of the Shwe Dagon pagoda. Around the enclosure lay the newly constructed cantonment area of the port - an anchorage and pilgrimage town that had been seized, burned and occupied by the British only ten years earlier. The bier of the State Prisoner - as the deceased was referred to - was accompanied by two of his sons and an elderly, bearded mullah. No women were allowed to attend, and a small crowd from the bazaar who had somehow heard about the prisoner's death were kept away by armed guards. Nevertheless, one or two managed to break through the cordon to touch the shroud before it was lowered into the grave.
The ceremony was brief. The British authorities had made sure not only that the grave was already dug, but that quantities of lime were on hand to guarantee the rapid decay of both bier and body. When the shortened funeral prayers had been recited - no lamentations or panegyrics were allowed - the earth was thrown in over the lime, and the turf carefully replaced so that within a month or so no mark would remain to indicate the place of burial. A week later the British Commissioner, Captain H. N. Davies, wrote to London to report what had passed, adding:
Have since visited the remaining State Prisoners - the very scum of the reduced Asiatic harem; found all correct. None of the family appear much affected by the death of the bed-ridden old man. His death was evidently due to pure decrepitude and paralysis in the region of the throat. He expired at 5 o'clock on the morning of the funeral. The death of the ex-King may be said to have had no effect on the Mahomedan part of the populace of Rangoon, except perhaps for a few fanatics who watch and pray for the final triumph of Islam. A bamboo fence surrounds the grave for some considerable distance, and by the time the fence is worn out, the grass will again have properly covered the spot, and no vestige will remain to distinguish where the last of the Great Moghuls rests.""
The State Prisoner Davies referred to was more properly known as Bahadur Shah II, known from his pen-name as Zafar, meaning Victory. Zafar was the last Mughal Emperor, and the direct descendant of Genghis Khan and Timur, of Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan. He was born in 1775, when the British were still a relatively modest and mainly coastal power in India, looking inwards from three enclaves on the Indian shore. In his lifetime he had seen his own dynasty reduced to humiliating insignificance, while the British transformed themselves from vulnerable traders into an aggressively expansionist military force. Zafar came late to the throne, succeeding his father only in his mid-sixties, when it was already impossible to reverse the political decline of the Mughals. But despite this he succeeded in creating around him in Delhi a court of great brilliance. Personally, he was one of the most talented, tolerant and likeable of his dynasty: a skilled calligrapher, a profound writer on Sufism, a discriminating patron of painters of miniatures, an inspired creator of gardens and an amateur architect. Most importantly he was a very serious mystical poet, who wrote not only in Urdu and Persian but Braj Bhasha and Punjabi, and partly through his patronage there took place arguably the greatest literary renaissance in modern Indian history. Himself a ghazal writer of great charm and accomplishment, Zafar's provided a showcase for the talents of India's greatest lyric poet, Ghalib, and his rival Zauq - the Mughal Poet Laureate, and the Salieri to Ghalib’s Mozart. While the British progressively took over more and more of the Mughal Emperor's power, removing his name from the coins, seizing complete control even of the city of Delhi itself, and finally laying...",The last Mughal : The Fall of a dynasty delhi 1857,William Dalrymple, , ,Penguin Classics,9780143102434,"1st Edition,2007",608,India,English

Hard Times – For These Times (commonly known as Hard Times) is the tenth novel by Charles Dickens, first published in 1854. The book surveys English society and satirises the social and economic conditions of the era.

Hard Times is unusual in several ways. It is by far the shortest of Dickens' novels, barely a quarter of the length of those written immediately before and after it.[1] Also, unlike all but one of his other novels, Hard Times has neither a preface nor illustrations. Moreover, it is his only novel not to have scenes set in London.[2] Instead the story is set in the fictitious Victorian industrial Coketown, a generic Northern English mill-town, in some ways similar to Manchester, though smaller. Coketown may be partially based on 19th-century Preston.

One of Dickens's reasons for writing Hard Times was that sales of his weekly periodical, Household Words, were low, and it was hoped the novel's publication in instalments would boost circulation – as indeed proved to be the case. Since publication it has received a mixed response from critics. Critics such as George Bernard Shaw and Thomas Macaulay have mainly focused on Dickens's treatment of trade unions and his post–Industrial Revolution pessimism regarding the divide between capitalist mill owners and undervalued workers during the Victorian era. F. R. Leavis, a great admirer of the book, included it – but not Dickens' work as a whole – as part of his Great Tradition of English novels.",Hard Times,Charles Dickens, , ,Penguin Classics,9780143427223,"1st Edition,2015",284,India,English

Penguin Classics’ 1982 edition of Victor Hugo’s classic historical novel Les Miserables is set in France and chronicles the life and struggles of Jean Valjean, an escaped convict, who is determined to free himself from his past and get accepted into society. However, when, in a case of mistaken identity, an innocent man is wrongfully arrested for a crime that Valjean committed, he must come to terms with his own conscience. Being relentlessly pursued by policeman Javert, Valjean must stay out of prison, not for his own sake, but in order to keep his word, to the penniless prostitute Fantine and protect her baby daughter.

Hailed as a literary classic, and one of the longest novels ever written, Les Miserables is a heroic tale of valour and injustice that paints a poignant view of the many tragedies of war, through a myriad of fascinating characters like that of Fantine, a beautiful, illiterate, unwed mother, who loses her factory job and is forced to first sell her hair, and then her teeth in order to survive, finally resorting to prostitution. Cossette, is her illegitimate daughter, who is ill treated at the hands of the Thenardiers to whom she was entrusted, but Valjean rescues her from them, and cares for her as his own child.

Les Miserables is a rich exploration of two decades of French history, depicting the turmoils of the war, including the Battle of Waterloo and the 1830 revolution, and capturing the moral philosophies and themes of religion and love in French society, through its many sub-plots woven alongside the main storyline of Jean Valjean’s life struggles. Les Miserables was a huge literary commercial success, having been translated into different languages, and adapted into many plays, musicals, and films for radio and television. The most recent film adaptation is the 2012 film starring Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman.

About Victor Hugo

Born in 1802, to a Catholic Royalist mother, and a father who was an officer in Napoleon's French army, Victor Hugo was a prominent French novelist, poet, artist, and dramatist of the romantic period. Subsequently, he wrote several successful epic novels namely, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Last Day Of A Condemned Man, Ninety-Three, The Man Who Laughs, and Toilers Of The Sea.

Hugo’s works often described as passionate and eloquent, are known to have been inspired by Chateaubriand - the famed French literary figure of the romantic movement, and depict social injustices, artistic trends, and the political environment prevalent during his time.
Regarded as a freethinking Republican who strongly idolised Napoleon, and revered his whole life as a prominent statesman who influenced democracy in France, Hugo lived abroad for a few years under self imposed exile, and moved back to spend the greater part of his life in France. His very first novel Han d’islande was published in 1823. He died at the age of 83, in 1885.",Les Miserable,Victor Hugo, , ,Penguin Classics,9780140444308,"Reprind,1982",1232,India,English

Gautama Buddha’s ideas and beliefs went against what people had believed in for centuries. He did not believe in the idea of a supreme God who could rescue humanity from sorrows and difficulties. He only taught people that nirvana could be found within each person and that it can be achieved if we chose to follow the right path. He has been one of the most influential people, but nobody knows much about the life of Siddhartha Gautama. The Buddha’s teachings have been followed for more than 1500 years in India and have guided many people from all walks of life. Buddhism is a religion that has been formed from his teachings and has gained popularity by people from all over the world. This book is an account of his life from when he was a prince to when he left home to attain nirvana. It also tells us the story of the lives of the people and kingdoms in ancient India.

Macbeth, Thane of Glamis, receives a prophecy from a trio of witches who predict that he will become Thane of Cawdor and ""king hereafter."" His wife, Lady Macbeth, urges him to seize the opportunity and take the throne. One night, Macbeth murders King Duncan in his sleep and frames the guards for the crime.

Macbeth's best friend, Banquo, was present for the witches' prophecy and realizes that Macbeth is responsible for King Duncan's murder. To protect himself, Macbeth has Banquo killed. Fleance, Banquo's son, escapes and is prophesied to become king.
Duncan's sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, flee Scotland, where they begin plotting against Macbeth. One of their allies, Macduff, poses a serious threat to Macbeth, so the new king has Macduff crowned king. Malcolm and Macduff join forces and prepare for war.
Overcome with remorse over the murder of King Duncan, Lady Macbeth commits suicide. Her death barely affects Macbeth, who has received three new prophecies: to beware Macduff, that ""none of woman born"" shall harm him, and that he won't be defeated until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane Hill.

Macduff's forces camouflage themselves with foliage from Birnam Wood as they march on Dunsinane.

Mahatma Gandhi’s autobiography begins with his childhood. Gandhi speaks about his childhood experiences and about his initial curiosity for non-vegetarian food, smoking and alcohol. He explains how he read Harishchandra and how it influenced him. Another text which influenced Gandhi was Shravana Pitrabhakti Nataka. He then speaks about his marriage, his father’s death and his distaste for physical training at school. He speaks about his trip to London, where his education moulded him into the man he would soon become. Later he went to South Africa, and discovered how the British discriminated against the coloured races. He began a movement, and it is this movement which sent ripples through the Indian Independence movement, one that he would spearhead in the next part of his life. Including an introduction by the former President of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, this edition is a must-have for all fans of history.

Summary of the Book

The best of times, the worst of times, the age of wisdom, the age of foolishness, the epoch of belief, the epoch of incredulity, the season of Light, the season of Darkness, the spring of hope, the winter of despair, having everything, yet nothing, leading to heaven, yet leading to the other way, the time of the French Revolution was all this and more. In this setting Dickens begins his most famous work, telling the story of the French peasantry demoralised by the French aristocracy in the years leading up to the revolution. Principally the story of Sidney Carton and Lucie Manette, this book follows them and the villainous Madame Defarge to tell a story of darkness, love, forgiveness, revenge and self-sacrifice.

Through their parallel experience of love – and its threatened loss – the sisters learn that sense must mix with sensibility if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money govern the rules of love.

The books opens by describing the life of a really upstanding dude named Bishop Myriel. (Well, his name is Myriel; his title is Bishop.) One day, an ex convict wanders into the bishop's village and can't find any food or lodging because everyone turns him away. The bishop gives him a place to stay and even forgives him when he (the convict) robs the bishop of his nicest cutlery. If that weren't enough, the bishop lets the convict a.k.a. Jean Valjean keep the silver if he promises to live a morally good life from now on.

Cue life-altering transformation. Jean Valjean becomes a rich factory owner and town leader, but he doesn't forget where he came from. He uses more than half his money to help the poor and can't stop doing good deeds, like promising a downtrodden prostitute named Fantine that he'll take care of her daughter after she dies.

There's a problem, though: he's technically in breach of his parole because he's changed his name and taken on a new identity. After a really committed policeman named Inspector Javert tracks him down, Valjean ends up in prison again until he escapes from prison by faking his death.

Once out, he tracks down and adopts Fantine's daughter Cosette, who's been living with some really nasty folks named Thénardier. Valjean moves with her to Paris and raises her in a convent to avoid Inspector Javert (who knows he is still alive). Years go by, and Jean and Cosette move out of the convent. But things get complicated when Cosette falls in love with a young man named Marius. Scared of bringing attention to himself, Valjean decides to take Cosette and move to England, where they'll be safe from the French authorities… and Cosette's new admirer.

When Marius finds out Cosette is leaving, he decides he has nothing to live for and joins a revolt that's taking place in Paris. Valjean's conscience twinges, and he goes to save him from the spectacularly doomed revolt. He also manages to save Inspector Javert from being killed by rebels, because he's just that kind of guy. Javert is so confused by this act of kindness that he jumps off a bridge and kills himself. (Ex-convicts can never have hearts of gold in Javert's universe.)

Marius and Cosette eventually get married, and Valjean decides that this is the time to reveal his criminal past to Marius, who then decides that he wants Valjean to keep away from Cosette in the future. Gee, thanks. Once Marius finds out that Valjean saved his life, though, he wants the man back in Cosette's life. Gee, thanks again. But it's too late. Valjean has already wasted away from his hurt feels. He dies with Cosette and Marius standing over his bed and telling him they love him. It's all pretty bittersweet, especially when it's set to music. (shmoop.com)",Les Miserables,Victor Hugo, , ,Penguin Classics,9780143427100,"Latest edition,2016",240,India,English

Around the World in Eighty Days has to be the most crazy, daring and impossible adventure you'll ever read, and its hero, the mysterious Phileas Fogg, is surely the coolest guy in the whole of English literature! Phileas Fogg is a ruthless perfectionist, handsome and rich, a man who lives his orderly life by the clock, and is always right. One evening, during a debate at his exclusive gentlemen's club about the length of time it would take to travel around the world, Fogg says it could be achieved in eighty days. And to prove it, he bets his entire fortune of £20,000 (which is approximately 1.6 million British pounds or 2.5 million US dollars in today's money!). With no time to lose, Fogg and his young French manservant, Passepartout, leave London on 2 October, 1872, telling his gobsmacked friends that he'll see them all back at the club on Saturday, 21 December at 8.45 p.m. precisely.
You can imagine that long before the days of high speed travel, not to mention sat nav, mobile phones and instant messaging, this is no easy challenge. But Fogg plans every stage of the trip with ultimate precision, using every bit of his ingenuity and cunning to the very end. Even when things don't quite go to plan he never panics or shows his emotions. But we do get to see a different side to Fogg's character when he risks losing everything, even his own life, to save Passepartout, whose youthful curiosity lands him in trouble on more than one occasion.
Around the World in Eighty Days is not only a fantastic journey filled with exotic locations, cultures and suspense, it is also a story about loyalty and friendship, and the rewards these can bring. When I first read it as a lad, I saw a world filled with excitement, danger, adventure and, above all, possibilities. It gave me a great sense of the vast, diverse nature of our planet and I wanted to get out there and discover it all for myself. It fostered in me my love of exploration and showed me that, with the right skills and the courage of my convictions, I would be able to survive all kinds of challenges. Maybe you, too, will draw inspiration from these amazing adventures and go on to see and do great things.
So, do you think the eccentric Phileas Fogg makes it back to London in time to win his bet? Read on and I'm sure, like me, you'll be on the edge of your seat right up to the very last page!",Around the World in Eighty Days,Jules Verne, , ,Penguin Classics,9780141366296,"Edition,2016",314,India,English

In Covent Garden, the Eynsford Hills wait for a cab in the rain. When Freddy goes to hail one, he knocks Liza's flowers out of her basket. She accepts money from Freddy's mother, then Colonel Pickering. A bystander warns her that a man is writing down what she is saying, and she confronts him, saying that she has done nothing wrong. Higgins amazes the crowd by imitating her accent and guessing where they all come from. Pickering and Higgins meet and agree to have dinner, and Higgins fills Liza's basket with money before he leaves. Liza leaves in a cab.

The next day, Liza intrudes upon Pickering and Higgins in Higgins's home. She wants English lessons, and Pickering bets that Higgins could not pass her off as a lady at the ambassador's ball in a month's time. Mrs. Pearce takes Liza away to bathe her and dress her more appropriately, and Liza's father arrives and demands some payment. Higgins likes him and gives him five pounds.

A few months later, Mrs. Higgins is writing letters at home when she is interrupted by her son, who shocks her by telling her that he is bringing a flower-girl to his house. The Eynsford Hills arrive for a visit, as does Eliza--with her newly elegant accent and manner. Freddy is infatuated right away. Eliza makes the mistake of swearing and describing her aunt's alcoholism, and she is hustled away by Higgins. Clara thinks that swearing is the new fashion and shocks her mother by saying ""bloody"" on the way out. Mrs. Higgins scolds Pickering and her son for not considering what is to be done with Eliza after the experiment.

At midnight at Higgins's house, Eliza enters looking exhausted. Higgins ignores her, looking for his slippers and crowing over her success at fooling everyone as his own. Eliza begins to look furious. When Higgins asks where his slippers are, Eliza throws them at his face. She explains that she does not know what to do with herself now that Higgins has transformed her. He suggests that she marry, to which she responds that she used to be something better than a prostitute when she sold flowers. She throws the ring that he gave her into the fireplace, and he loses his temper at her and leaves the room. She looks for the ring in the ashes.

Mrs. Higgins is in her drawing room when her son comes and tells her that Eliza has run away. Doolittle arrives and announces that after he spoke with Higgins, Higgins recommended him as a speaker to an American millionaire who died and left him everything. Doolittle is now middle-class and hating every minute of it; his mistress is forcing him to marry her that afternoon. Eliza comes downstairs (she ran away to Mrs. Higgins's house), and Higgins looks flabbergasted. Doolittle invites Pickering and Mrs. Higgins to the wedding, and they leave Eliza and Higgins alone to talk. Eliza says that she does not want to be treated like a pair of slippers--and Freddy writes her love letters every day. When she threatens to become a phonetics teacher herself and use Higgins's methods, he says that he likes the new, stronger version of Eliza. He wants to live with her and Pickering as ""three bachelors.""

Mrs. Higgins returns dressed for the wedding, and she takes Eliza with her. Higgins asks her to run his errands for him, including that of buying some cheese and ham. She says a final goodbye to him, and he seems confident that she will follow his command.

The onstage drama ends, and Shaw narrates, in an epilogue, that Eliza recognizes Higgins as predestined to be a bachelor; she marries Freddy instead. With a gift from Colonel Pickering, Eliza opens a flower shop. The only person truly bothered by this state of affairs is Clara, who decides that the marriage will not help her own marriage prospects. But then she begins to read H.G. Wells and travel in the circles of his fans, and she is convinced to begin working in a furniture shop herself in the hopes that she might meet Wells (because the woman who owns the shop is also a fan of his). Freddy is not very practical, and he and Eliza must take classes in bookkeeping to make their business a success. They do reach success, and they live a fairly comfortable life.

The book was first published in 1869 and is widely considered as Leo Tolstoy’s magnum opus.    
Summary Of The Book:  
Originally written in Russian, War And Peace has been translated into a number of languages, including English. The novel, though one of the longest ever written, is a must read for every literature enthusiast. The novel is set in the early 19th century and revolves around the French invasion of Russia by Napoleon.
War And Peace is truly an epic in itself and is divided into four volumes and has an epilogue in two parts. Most of the characters of the large cast are introduced early, at a social party in St. Petersburg. While the novel is fictional in nature, it does include some historical facts and figures, such as Alexander I and Napoleon, and the French Invasion of Russia in 1812 and the Napoleonic Wars. The novel takes us on an unforgettable journey as we encounter various characters in search of love amidst war and peace.
The novel’s plot can be seen from two different perspectives. First, it depicts the Napoleonic invasion of Russia, and the Russian war efforts to defeat the French. The other plot is mainly concerned with the personal dramas of five aristocratic families, particularly the Bolkonskys, the Bezukhovs, and the Rostovs. The novel follows these representatives of the Russian aristocracy, as they build their lives in a war torn empire.
The principal characters of the novel are three young aristocrats, Pierre, Andrei and Natasha. While the novel focuses on the aristocracy, the peasantry and the soldiers are given ample voice throughout. War And Peace is not just a novel about human emotions, frailties and history, but it is also a discourse on Tolstoy’s philosophies. The later part of the novel includes many sections that throw light on Tolstoy’s philosophical ideologies.

Elizabeth Bennet is an unpolished girl from the country. Despite being one of the five daughters of an English gentleman, she is unused to the behaviour of the gentry. When she attends a ball, she notices a dashing young man called Fitzwilliam Darcy. She immediately takes him for a conceited and arrogant man, and the fact that Darcy is deeply involved in the troubled relationship between his friend and Elizabeth’s sister makes her hate him even more. However, in a series of comic events which poke fun at the gentile society and the life of people in the middle class during Jane Austen’s era, this story brings Elizabeth and Darcy closer. This edition also includes a new chronology to help readers understand the characters and the timeline, as well as the original Penguin Publications’ introduction written by Tony Tanner.

A vital cornerstone to Marx's overall theory of economics, the second volume of Capital considers in depth the nature of commodity and the market-place in bourgeois society. Exploring the manner in which capitalist society must lead inevitably to a 'spiralling movement of unbalanced growth and social crisis, it argues forcefully that the mass, production of goods distributed rapidly around the globe causes wealth to be placed increasingly in the hands of the few, at the expense of the basic human needs of the many. As Marx also shows here, a thriving capitalist society necessarily tends towards overproduction, leading to vast economic convulsions. This immensely powerful work argues that prosperity in a capitalist society inevitably holds within itself the seeds of its own destruction.
David Fernbach's translation captures the clarity and brilliance of Marx's original work. The introduction, by Ernest Mandel, explores the position of the volume as part of the wider work, explains Marxist thought and considers its long-term influence.",Capital:  A Critique of Political Economy (Volume II),Karl Marx, , ,Penguin Classics,9780140445695,"Reprint,1992",624,India,English

Summary of the Book


The best of times, the worst of times, the age of wisdom, the age of foolishness, the epoch of belief, the epoch of incredulity, the season of Light, the season of Darkness, the spring of hope, the winter of despair, having everything, yet nothing, leading to heaven, yet leading to the other way, the time of the French Revolution was all this and more. In this setting Dickens begins his most famous work, telling the story of the French peasantry demoralised by the French aristocracy in the years leading up to the revolution. Principally the story of Sidney Carton and Lucie Manette, this book follows them and the villainous Madame Defarge to tell a story of darkness, love, forgiveness, revenge and self-sacrifice.

""The Idiot"" is Fyodor Dostoyevsky's 1868 novel which tells the story of Prince Lyov Nikolayevich Myshkin who, after a long absence, returns to Russia from Switzerland where he sought treatment for his epilepsy. The story is primarily a tragic tale of the struggle for the love of a woman, Nastasya Filippovna, between Myshkin and Rogozhin, a dark and impassioned man that the Prince meets on the train to St. Petersburg. ""The Idiot"" is a classic tale of the conflict between good and evil. On the one hand Prince Myshkin represents Dostoyevksy's attempt to portray a Christ-like ""positively good man"" which is sharply contrasted with not only the dark and roguish character of Rogozhin but also with the nature of Russian upper-class society depicted in the novel.",The Idiot,Fyodor Dostoyevsky, , ,Penguin Classics,9780140447927,"1st Edition,2004",732,India,English

INTRODUCTION
At 4 p.m. on a hazy, humid winter's afternoon in Rangoon in November 1862, soon after the end of the monsoon, a shrouded corpse was escorted by a small group of British soldiers to an anonymous grave at the back of a walled prison enclosure.
This enclosure lay overlooking the muddy brown waters of the Rangoon river, a little downhill from the great gilt spire of the Shwe Dagon pagoda. Around the enclosure lay the newly constructed cantonment area of the port - an anchorage and pilgrimage town that had been seized, burned and occupied by the British only ten years earlier. The bier of the State Prisoner - as the deceased was referred to - was accompanied by two of his sons and an elderly, bearded mullah. No women were allowed to attend, and a small crowd from the bazaar who had somehow heard about the prisoner's death were kept away by armed guards. Nevertheless, one or two managed to break through the cordon to touch the shroud before it was lowered into the grave.
The ceremony was brief. The British authorities had made sure not only that the grave was already dug, but that quantities of lime were on hand to guarantee the rapid decay of both bier and body. When the shortened funeral prayers had been recited - no lamentations or panegyrics were allowed - the earth was thrown in over the lime, and the turf carefully replaced so that within a month or so no mark would remain to indicate the place of burial. A week later the British Commissioner, Captain H. N. Davies, wrote to London to report what had passed, adding:
Have since visited the remaining State Prisoners - the very scum of the reduced Asiatic harem; found all correct. None of the family appear much affected by the death of the bed-ridden old man. His death was evidently due to pure decrepitude and paralysis in the region of the throat. He expired at 5 o'clock on the morning of the funeral. The death of the ex-King may be said to have had no effect on the Mahomedan part of the populace of Rangoon, except perhaps for a few fanatics who watch and pray for the final triumph of Islam. A bamboo fence surrounds the grave for some considerable distance, and by the time the fence is worn out, the grass will again have properly covered the spot, and no vestige will remain to distinguish where the last of the Great Moghuls rests.""
The State Prisoner Davies referred to was more properly known as Bahadur Shah II, known from his pen-name as Zafar, meaning Victory. Zafar was the last Mughal Emperor, and the direct descendant of Genghis Khan and Timur, of Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan. He was born in 1775, when the British were still a relatively modest and mainly coastal power in India, looking inwards from three enclaves on the Indian shore. In his lifetime he had seen his own dynasty reduced to humiliating insignificance, while the British transformed themselves from vulnerable traders into an aggressively expansionist military force. Zafar came late to the throne, succeeding his father only in his mid-sixties, when it was already impossible to reverse the political decline of the Mughals. But despite this he succeeded in creating around him in Delhi a court of great brilliance. Personally, he was one of the most talented, tolerant and likeable of his dynasty: a skilled calligrapher, a profound writer on Sufism, a discriminating patron of painters of miniatures, an inspired creator of gardens and an amateur architect. Most importantly he was a very serious mystical poet, who wrote not only in Urdu and Persian but Braj Bhasha and Punjabi, and partly through his patronage there took place arguably the greatest literary renaissance in modern Indian history. Himself a ghazal writer of great charm and accomplishment, Zafar's provided a showcase for the talents of India's greatest lyric poet, Ghalib, and his rival Zauq - the Mughal Poet Laureate, and the Salieri to Ghalib’s Mozart. While the British progressively took over more and more of the Mughal Emperor's power, removing his name from the coins, seizing complete control even of the city of Delhi itself, and finally laying...",The last Mughal : The Fall of a dynasty delhi 1857,William Dalrymple, , ,Penguin Classics,9780143102434,"1st Edition,2007",608,India,English

Hard Times – For These Times (commonly known as Hard Times) is the tenth novel by Charles Dickens, first published in 1854. The book surveys English society and satirises the social and economic conditions of the era.

Hard Times is unusual in several ways. It is by far the shortest of Dickens' novels, barely a quarter of the length of those written immediately before and after it.[1] Also, unlike all but one of his other novels, Hard Times has neither a preface nor illustrations. Moreover, it is his only novel not to have scenes set in London.[2] Instead the story is set in the fictitious Victorian industrial Coketown, a generic Northern English mill-town, in some ways similar to Manchester, though smaller. Coketown may be partially based on 19th-century Preston.

One of Dickens's reasons for writing Hard Times was that sales of his weekly periodical, Household Words, were low, and it was hoped the novel's publication in instalments would boost circulation – as indeed proved to be the case. Since publication it has received a mixed response from critics. Critics such as George Bernard Shaw and Thomas Macaulay have mainly focused on Dickens's treatment of trade unions and his post–Industrial Revolution pessimism regarding the divide between capitalist mill owners and undervalued workers during the Victorian era. F. R. Leavis, a great admirer of the book, included it – but not Dickens' work as a whole – as part of his Great Tradition of English novels.",Hard Times,Charles Dickens, , ,Penguin Classics,9780143427223,"1st Edition,2015",284,India,English

Penguin Classics’ 1982 edition of Victor Hugo’s classic historical novel Les Miserables is set in France and chronicles the life and struggles of Jean Valjean, an escaped convict, who is determined to free himself from his past and get accepted into society. However, when, in a case of mistaken identity, an innocent man is wrongfully arrested for a crime that Valjean committed, he must come to terms with his own conscience. Being relentlessly pursued by policeman Javert, Valjean must stay out of prison, not for his own sake, but in order to keep his word, to the penniless prostitute Fantine and protect her baby daughter.

Hailed as a literary classic, and one of the longest novels ever written, Les Miserables is a heroic tale of valour and injustice that paints a poignant view of the many tragedies of war, through a myriad of fascinating characters like that of Fantine, a beautiful, illiterate, unwed mother, who loses her factory job and is forced to first sell her hair, and then her teeth in order to survive, finally resorting to prostitution. Cossette, is her illegitimate daughter, who is ill treated at the hands of the Thenardiers to whom she was entrusted, but Valjean rescues her from them, and cares for her as his own child.

Les Miserables is a rich exploration of two decades of French history, depicting the turmoils of the war, including the Battle of Waterloo and the 1830 revolution, and capturing the moral philosophies and themes of religion and love in French society, through its many sub-plots woven alongside the main storyline of Jean Valjean’s life struggles. Les Miserables was a huge literary commercial success, having been translated into different languages, and adapted into many plays, musicals, and films for radio and television.

Born in 1802, to a Catholic Royalist mother, and a father who was an officer in Napoleon's French army, Victor Hugo was a prominent French novelist, poet, artist, and dramatist of the romantic period. Subsequently, he wrote several successful epic novels namely, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Last Day Of A Condemned Man, Ninety-Three, The Man Who Laughs, and Toilers Of The Sea.

Hugo’s works often described as passionate and eloquent, are known to have been inspired by Chateaubriand - the famed French literary figure of the romantic movement, and depict social injustices, artistic trends, and the political environment prevalent during his time.
Regarded as a freethinking Republican who strongly idolised Napoleon, and revered his whole life as a prominent statesman who influenced democracy in France, Hugo lived abroad for a few years under self imposed exile, and moved back to spend the greater part of his life in France. His very first novel Han d’islande was published in 1823. He died at the age of 83, in 1885.",Les Miserable,Victor Hugo, , ,Penguin Classics,9780140444308,"Reprind,1982",1232,India,English

Gautama Buddha’s ideas and beliefs went against what people had believed in for centuries. He did not believe in the idea of a supreme God who could rescue humanity from sorrows and difficulties. He only taught people that nirvana could be found within each person and that it can be achieved if we chose to follow the right path. He has been one of the most influential people, but nobody knows much about the life of Siddhartha Gautama. The Buddha’s teachings have been followed for more than 1500 years in India and have guided many people from all walks of life. Buddhism is a religion that has been formed from his teachings and has gained popularity by people from all over the world. This book is an account of his life from when he was a prince to when he left home to attain nirvana. It also tells us the story of the lives of the people and kingdoms in ancient India.

Macbeth, Thane of Glamis, receives a prophecy from a trio of witches who predict that he will become Thane of Cawdor and ""king hereafter."" His wife, Lady Macbeth, urges him to seize the opportunity and take the throne. One night, Macbeth murders King Duncan in his sleep and frames the guards for the crime.

Macbeth's best friend, Banquo, was present for the witches' prophecy and realizes that Macbeth is responsible for King Duncan's murder. To protect himself, Macbeth has Banquo killed. Fleance, Banquo's son, escapes and is prophesied to become king.
Duncan's sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, flee Scotland, where they begin plotting against Macbeth. One of their allies, Macduff, poses a serious threat to Macbeth, so the new king has Macduff crowned king. Malcolm and Macduff join forces and prepare for war.
Overcome with remorse over the murder of King Duncan, Lady Macbeth commits suicide. Her death barely affects Macbeth, who has received three new prophecies: to beware Macduff, that ""none of woman born"" shall harm him, and that he won't be defeated until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane Hill. Macbeth nearly assumes that he is invincible.
Macduff's forces camouflage themselves with foliage from Birnam Wood as they march on Dunsinane. Macduff, the product of a gruesome c-section, was not ""of woman born"" and thus has the power to defeat Macbeth, who realizes too late that the witches' prophecies foretold his death and not his success.

Mahatma Gandhi’s autobiography begins with his childhood. Gandhi speaks about his childhood experiences and about his initial curiosity for non-vegetarian food, smoking and alcohol. He explains how he read Harishchandra and how it influenced him. Another text which influenced Gandhi was Shravana Pitrabhakti Nataka. He then speaks about his marriage, his father’s death and his distaste for physical training at school. He speaks about his trip to London, where his education moulded him into the man he would soon become. Later he went to South Africa, and discovered how the British discriminated against the coloured races. He began a movement, and it is this movement which sent ripples through the Indian Independence movement, one that he would spearhead in the next part of his life. Including an introduction by the former President of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, this edition is a must-have for all fans of history.

Summary of the Book

The best of times, the worst of times, the age of wisdom, the age of foolishness, the epoch of belief, the epoch of incredulity, the season of Light, the season of Darkness, the spring of hope, the winter of despair, having everything, yet nothing, leading to heaven, yet leading to the other way, the time of the French Revolution was all this and more. In this setting Dickens begins his most famous work, telling the story of the French peasantry demoralised by the French aristocracy in the years leading up to the revolution. Principally the story of Sidney Carton and Lucie Manette, this book follows them and the villainous Madame Defarge to tell a story of darkness, love, forgiveness, revenge and self-sacrifice.

The books opens by describing the life of a really upstanding dude named Bishop Myriel. (Well, his name is Myriel; his title is Bishop.) One day, an ex convict wanders into the bishop's village and can't find any food or lodging because everyone turns him away. The bishop gives him a place to stay and even forgives him when he (the convict) robs the bishop of his nicest cutlery. If that weren't enough, the bishop lets the convict a.k.a. Jean Valjean keep the silver if he promises to live a morally good life from now on.

Cue life-altering transformation. Jean Valjean becomes a rich factory owner and town leader, but he doesn't forget where he came from. He uses more than half his money to help the poor and can't stop doing good deeds, like promising a downtrodden prostitute named Fantine that he'll take care of her daughter after she dies.

There's a problem, though: he's technically in breach of his parole because he's changed his name and taken on a new identity. After a really committed policeman named Inspector Javert tracks him down, Valjean ends up in prison again until he escapes from prison by faking his death.

Once out, he tracks down and adopts Fantine's daughter Cosette, who's been living with some really nasty folks named Thénardier. Valjean moves with her to Paris and raises her in a convent to avoid Inspector Javert (who knows he is still alive). Years go by, and Jean and Cosette move out of the convent. But things get complicated when Cosette falls in love with a young man named Marius. Scared of bringing attention to himself, Valjean decides to take Cosette and move to England, where they'll be safe from the French authorities… and Cosette's new admirer.

When Marius finds out Cosette is leaving, he decides he has nothing to live for and joins a revolt that's taking place in Paris. Valjean's conscience twinges, and he goes to save him from the spectacularly doomed revolt. He also manages to save Inspector Javert from being killed by rebels, because he's just that kind of guy. Javert is so confused by this act of kindness that he jumps off a bridge and kills himself. (Ex-convicts can never have hearts of gold in Javert's universe.)

Marius and Cosette eventually get married, and Valjean decides that this is the time to reveal his criminal past to Marius, who then decides that he wants Valjean to keep away from Cosette in the future. Gee, thanks. Once Marius finds out that Valjean saved his life, though, he wants the man back in Cosette's life. Gee, thanks again. But it's too late. Valjean has already wasted away from his hurt feels. He dies with Cosette and Marius standing over his bed and telling him they love him. It's all pretty bittersweet, especially when it's set to music. (shmoop.com)",Les Miserables,Victor Hugo, , ,Penguin Classics,9780143427100,"Latest edition,2016",240,India,English

Around the World in Eighty Days has to be the most crazy, daring and impossible adventure you'll ever read, and its hero, the mysterious Phileas Fogg, is surely the coolest guy in the whole of English literature! Phileas Fogg is a ruthless perfectionist, handsome and rich, a man who lives his orderly life by the clock, and is always right. One evening, during a debate at his exclusive gentlemen's club about the length of time it would take to travel around the world, Fogg says it could be achieved in eighty days. And to prove it, he bets his entire fortune of £20,000 (which is approximately 1.6 million British pounds or 2.5 million US dollars in today's money!). With no time to lose, Fogg and his young French manservant, Passepartout, leave London on 2 October, 1872, telling his gobsmacked friends that he'll see them all back at the club on Saturday, 21 December at 8.45 p.m. precisely.
You can imagine that long before the days of high speed travel, not to mention sat nav, mobile phones and instant messaging, this is no easy challenge. But Fogg plans every stage of the trip with ultimate precision, using every bit of his ingenuity and cunning to the very end. Even when things don't quite go to plan he never panics or shows his emotions. But we do get to see a different side to Fogg's character when he risks losing everything, even his own life, to save Passepartout, whose youthful curiosity lands him in trouble on more than one occasion.
Around the World in Eighty Days is not only a fantastic journey filled with exotic locations, cultures and suspense, it is also a story about loyalty and friendship, and the rewards these can bring. When I first read it as a lad, I saw a world filled with excitement, danger, adventure and, above all, possibilities. It gave me a great sense of the vast, diverse nature of our planet and I wanted to get out there and discover it all for myself. It fostered in me my love of exploration and showed me that, with the right skills and the courage of my convictions, I would be able to survive all kinds of challenges. Maybe you, too, will draw inspiration from these amazing adventures and go on to see and do great things.
So, do you think the eccentric Phileas Fogg makes it back to London in time to win his bet? Read on and I'm sure, like me, you'll be on the edge of your seat right up to the very last page!",Around the World in Eighty Days,Jules Verne, , ,Penguin Classics,9780141366296,"Edition,2016",314,India,English

The title poem evokes the inner turmoil of a man who must return to the drudgery of work after visiting his home for the Durga Puja vacation. Haunted by his four-year-old daughter's parting words, -I won't let you go!' he finds his anguish reflected in the vagaries of nature, with the earth echoing his pain. The other poems in this collection brim with Tagore's compassionate humanity and delicate sensuousness. From detailing the nuances of intimate relationships to ruminating on the vast cosmos, these poems glow with a burning awareness of man's place in the universe, reaffirming Tagore's reputation as one of India's greatest modern poets.",I Won't Let You Go: Selected Poems,"Rabindranath Tagore,Ketaki Kushari Daison", , ,Penguin Classics,9780143416142,"1st Edition,2011",320,India,English
