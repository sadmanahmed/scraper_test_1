Greed ,এলফ্রিডে ইয়েলিনেক,"TK. 1,610","",https://rokomari.com//book/84639/greed,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/rokimg_20140716_84639.gif,"Kurt Janisch is an ambitious, but frustrated, country policeman. Things are not going right in his life - at least not fast enough. But a country policeman gets talking to a lot of people in the line of duty - particularly women. Lonely, middle-aged women, women with a bit of property perhaps ... Matters go from bad to worse: for Kurt Janisch, for the women who fall for him. Someone sees too much, knows too much. Soon there's a body in a lake and a murderer to be caught.

Set amid the mountains and small towns of southern Austria, Greed is a powerful reflection on ageing. As always, Jelinek gives the reader a lot to think about: the ecological costs of affluence, the inescapable burden and inadequacy of everyday words, the exploitative nature of relations between men and women, the impossibility of life without relationships. In Greed Jelinek expresses her love/hate relationship with Austria: it is a mesmerising portrait of evil.

Two factory workers, Brigitte and Paula, dream and talk about finding happiness, a comfortable home and a good man. They realize that their quest will be as hard as work at the factory. Brigitte subordinates her feelings and goes for for Heinz, a young, plump, up-and-coming businessman. With Paula, feelings and dreams become confused. She gets pregnant by Erich, the forestry worker. He?s handsome, so they marry. Brigitte gets it right. Paula gets it wrong. Using the conventions and language of romantic fiction, Elfriede Jelinek has written a moving tragedy whose power lies in its refusal to take at face value its characters? dreams and aspirations.",Women as lover,Elfriede Jelinek, , ,Portfolio,9781852422370,"1st Edition,1995",208,India,English

A man is out walking in a park in Vienna. He will be beaten up by four teenagers, not for his money or anything he may have done to them, but because the youths are arrogant and very pleased with themselves. This arrogance is their way to reacting to the decaying corpse that is Austria, where everyone has a closet in which to hide their Nazi histories, their sexual perversions, and their hatred of the foreigner.

In fierce, exhilarating prose, Elfriede Jelinek shows in Wonderful, Wonderful Times how the present is corrupted by the crimes of the past.

Greed ,এলফ্রিডে ইয়েলিনেক,"TK. 1,610","",https://rokomari.com//book/84639/greed,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/rokimg_20140716_84639.gif,"Kurt Janisch is an ambitious, but frustrated, country policeman. Things are not going right in his life - at least not fast enough. But a country policeman gets talking to a lot of people in the line of duty - particularly women. Lonely, middle-aged women, women with a bit of property perhaps ... Matters go from bad to worse: for Kurt Janisch, for the women who fall for him. Someone sees too much, knows too much. Soon there's a body in a lake and a murderer to be caught.

Set amid the mountains and small towns of southern Austria, Greed is a powerful reflection on ageing. As always, Jelinek gives the reader a lot to think about: the ecological costs of affluence, the inescapable burden and inadequacy of everyday words, the exploitative nature of relations between men and women, the impossibility of life without relationships. In Greed Jelinek expresses her love/hate relationship with Austria: it is a mesmerising portrait of evil.

Two factory workers, Brigitte and Paula, dream and talk about finding happiness, a comfortable home and a good man. They realize that their quest will be as hard as work at the factory. Brigitte subordinates her feelings and goes for for Heinz, a young, plump, up-and-coming businessman. With Paula, feelings and dreams become confused. She gets pregnant by Erich, the forestry worker. He?s handsome, so they marry. Brigitte gets it right. Paula gets it wrong. Using the conventions and language of romantic fiction, Elfriede Jelinek has written a moving tragedy whose power lies in its refusal to take at face value its characters? dreams and aspirations.",Women as lover,Elfriede Jelinek, , ,Portfolio,9781852422370,"1st Edition,1995",208,India,English

A man is out walking in a park in Vienna. He will be beaten up by four teenagers, not for his money or anything he may have done to them, but because the youths are arrogant and very pleased with themselves. This arrogance is their way to reacting to the decaying corpse that is Austria, where everyone has a closet in which to hide their Nazi histories, their sexual perversions, and their hatred of the foreigner.

In fierce, exhilarating prose, Elfriede Jelinek shows in Wonderful, Wonderful Times how the present is corrupted by the crimes of the past.
