400 million Indians were liberated at the stroke of midnight on 15th August, 1947. The British Empire withdrew from the country with a grand party. What was happening behind the scenes? Who all were involved in shaping India’s new and free future? Alex Von Tunzelmann answers all these questions in this brilliantly insightful book Indian Summer: The Secret History Of The End Of An Empire. It was one of the significant moments of not just Indian history, but world history as well.

This book recreates the defining moments of twentieth century Indian history that includes the Partition, the Independence, and the final days of the British Raj. It is an accurate account of how a handful of people changed the lives of millions. These include Louis and Edwina Mountbatten, the couple appointed to end the British Raj in India at the earliest, Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister to be, and Gandhi, a mystical leader who enchanted the entire nation.

Indian Summer: The Secret History Of The End Of An Empire equally focuses on various other peripheral characters such as Mohammed Ali Jinnah and Patel, who had a role in this major event. This vivid historical account chronicles the events which tore apart the greatest empire ever, through the players who made it happen. It further unveils the secrets of these players and talks about the private deals, the dreadful conflict in Kashmir, the Cold War conspiracies, and the personal drama that unfolded as a clandestine love affair ignited between Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten.

Several things changed after the British Raj withdrew from India and it led to intense turmoil in a free society. Britain didn’t remain a superpower anymore after the loss of India. The two newly formed countries, India and Pakistan, descended into terror and anarchy. And most importantly, this one decision led to the death of one million people and the dispossession of over ten million. Indian Summer: The Secret History Of The End Of An Empire is a spellbinding tale of history, romance, and divided loyalties, written with wit and a sharp eye for detail. Alex Von Tunzelmann, in an astute manner, relates how a few extraordinary people determined the fate of nations and changed the world for ever.

A policewoman in a small Florida community, Sloan Reynolds knows that her modest upbringing was a long way from the social whirl of Palm Beach, the world inhabited by her father and her sister, Paris. Total strangers to Sloan, they have never tried to contact her -- until a sudden invitation arrives, to meet them and indulge in the Palm Beach social season.
A woman who values her investigative work more than a Dior dress, Sloan is unmoved by the long-overdue parental gesture. But when FBI agent Paul Richardson informs her that her father and his associates are suspected of fraud, conspiracy, and murder, Sloan agrees to enter into her father's life -- while hiding her true profession.
Sloan's on top of her game until she meets Noah Maitland, a multinational corporate player and one of the FBI's prime suspects -- and finds herself powerfully attracted to him, against her deepest instincts. When a shocking murder shatters the seductive facade of the wealth and glamour surrounding her, Sloan must maneuver through a maze of deceit and passion, to find someone to trust -- and to decipher the truth behind those terrifying whispers in the dark.",Night whisper,Judith McNaught, , ,Pocket Books,9780671525743,"1st Edition,1999",451,Abroad,English

There have been many imitators, but only Jackie Collins can tell you what really goes on in the fastest lane of all. From Beverly Hills bedrooms to a raunchy prowl along the streets of Hollywood; from glittering rock parties and concerts to stretch limos and the mansions of the power brokers -- Jackie Collins chronicles the real truth from the inside looking out.
Jackie Collins has been called a \""raunchy moralist\"" by the late director Louis Malle and \""Hollywood\'s own Marcel Proust\"" by Vanity Fair magazine. With over 400 million copies of her books sold in more than 40 countries, and with some twenty-seven New York Times bestsellers to her credit, Jackie Collins is one of the world\'s top-selling novelists. She is known for giving her readers an unrivaled insiders knowledge of Hollywood and the glamorous lives and loves of the rich, famous, and infamous! \""I write about real people in disguise,\"" she says. \""If anything, my characters are toned down -- the truth is much more bizarre.\""
Jackie Collins started writing as a teenager, making up steamy stories her schoolmates paid to devour. Her first book, The World is Full of Married Men, became a sensational bestseller because of its open sexuality and the way it dealt honestly with the double standard. After that came The Stud, Sinners, The Love Killers, The World is Full of Divorced Women, The Bitch, Lovers And Gamblers, Chances, and then the international sensation, Hollywood Wives -- a #1 New York Times bestseller, which was made into one of ABC\'s highest-rated miniseries starring Anthony Hopkins and Candice Bergen.
The Stud, The World is Full of Married Men, and The Bitch were also filmed -- this time for the big screen. And Jackie wrote an original movie, Yesterday\'s Hero, starring Ian McShane and Suzanne Somers.
Readers couldn\'t wait to race through Lucky, her next book -- a sequel to Chances -- and the story of an incredibly beautiful, strong woman, another New York Times number one.
Then came the bad boys of Hollywood in the steamy Hollywood Husbands -- a novel which kept everyone guessing the identities of the true-to-life Hollywood characters.
Jackie then wrote Rock Star -- the story of three rock superstars and their rise to the top, followed by the long-waited sequel to Chances and Lucky -- Lady Boss -- tracking the further adventures of the wild and powerful Lucky Santangelo as she takes control of a Hollywood studio.
Both Lucky and Chances were written and adapted for NBC television by Jackie, who also executive produced the highly successful six-hour miniseries Lucky/Chances, starring Nicollete Sheridan and Sandra Bullock.

And then the dangerously close to the truth Hollywood Kids -- a story of power, sex, danger and ambition among the grown offspring of major celebrities.
In 1996 Vendetta - Lucky\'s Revenge was published -- and became an immediate New York Times bestseller.

Hollywood Wives - The New Generation became a blockbuster bestseller in 2001, following in the footsteps of the original Hollywood Wives. Hollywood Wives - The New Generation featured a brand new cast of characters and a totally fresh perspective on how women pursue power, love, sex, and success in Tinsletown today.

This all takes place over seven days in New York, and is another New York Times bestseller.

In Drop Dead Beautiful Lucky meets old friends and enemies, and deals with her wild sixteen-year-old daughter, Max, who is as stubborn and strong as her mom.

Next came Married Lovers, a powerful look at the ins and outs of marriage in L.A. It\'s also the story of an under-age Russian girl who becomes involved in the sex trade, and eventually arrives in Hollywood and causes major trouble.

400 million Indians were liberated at the stroke of midnight on 15th August, 1947. The British Empire withdrew from the country with a grand party. What was happening behind the scenes? Who all were involved in shaping India’s new and free future? Alex Von Tunzelmann answers all these questions in this brilliantly insightful book Indian Summer: The Secret History Of The End Of An Empire. It was one of the significant moments of not just Indian history, but world history as well.

This book recreates the defining moments of twentieth century Indian history that includes the Partition, the Independence, and the final days of the British Raj. It is an accurate account of how a handful of people changed the lives of millions. These include Louis and Edwina Mountbatten, the couple appointed to end the British Raj in India at the earliest, Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister to be, and Gandhi, a mystical leader who enchanted the entire nation.

Indian Summer: The Secret History Of The End Of An Empire equally focuses on various other peripheral characters such as Mohammed Ali Jinnah and Patel, who had a role in this major event. This vivid historical account chronicles the events which tore apart the greatest empire ever, through the players who made it happen. It further unveils the secrets of these players and talks about the private deals, the dreadful conflict in Kashmir, the Cold War conspiracies, and the personal drama that unfolded as a clandestine love affair ignited between Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten.

Several things changed after the British Raj withdrew from India and it led to intense turmoil in a free society. Britain didn’t remain a superpower anymore after the loss of India. The two newly formed countries, India and Pakistan, descended into terror and anarchy. And most importantly, this one decision led to the death of one million people and the dispossession of over ten million. Indian Summer: The Secret History Of The End Of An Empire is a spellbinding tale of history, romance, and divided loyalties, written with wit and a sharp eye for detail. Alex Von Tunzelmann, in an astute manner, relates how a few extraordinary people determined the fate of nations and changed the world for ever.

""Night Whispers""
A policewoman in a small Florida community, Sloan Reynolds knows that her modest upbringing was a long way from the social whirl of Palm Beach, the world inhabited by her father and her sister, Paris. Total strangers to Sloan, they have never tried to contact her -- until a sudden invitation arrives, to meet them and indulge in the Palm Beach social season.
A woman who values her investigative work more than a Dior dress, Sloan is unmoved by the long-overdue parental gesture. But when FBI agent Paul Richardson informs her that her father and his associates are suspected of fraud, conspiracy, and murder, Sloan agrees to enter into her father's life -- while hiding her true profession.
Sloan's on top of her game until she meets Noah Maitland, a multinational corporate player and one of the FBI's prime suspects -- and finds herself powerfully attracted to him, against her deepest instincts. When a shocking murder shatters the seductive facade of the wealth and glamour surrounding her, Sloan must maneuver through a maze of deceit and passion, to find someone to trust -- and to decipher the truth behind those terrifying whispers in the dark.",Night whisper,Judith McNaught, , ,Pocket Books,9780671525743,"1st Edition,1999",451,Abroad,English

There have been many imitators, but only Jackie Collins can tell you what really goes on in the fastest lane of all. From Beverly Hills bedrooms to a raunchy prowl along the streets of Hollywood; from glittering rock parties and concerts to stretch limos and the mansions of the power brokers -- Jackie Collins chronicles the real truth from the inside looking out.
Jackie Collins has been called a \""raunchy moralist\"" by the late director Louis Malle and \""Hollywood\'s own Marcel Proust\"" by Vanity Fair magazine. With over 400 million copies of her books sold in more than 40 countries, and with some twenty-seven New York Times bestsellers to her credit, Jackie Collins is one of the world\'s top-selling novelists. She is known for giving her readers an unrivaled insiders knowledge of Hollywood and the glamorous lives and loves of the rich, famous, and infamous! \""I write about real people in disguise,\"" she says. \""If anything, my characters are toned down -- the truth is much more bizarre.\""
Jackie Collins started writing as a teenager, making up steamy stories her schoolmates paid to devour. Her first book, The World is Full of Married Men, became a sensational bestseller because of its open sexuality and the way it dealt honestly with the double standard. After that came The Stud, Sinners, The Love Killers, The World is Full of Divorced Women, The Bitch, Lovers And Gamblers, Chances, and then the international sensation, Hollywood Wives -- a #1 New York Times bestseller, which was made into one of ABC\'s highest-rated miniseries starring Anthony Hopkins and Candice Bergen.
The Stud, The World is Full of Married Men, and The Bitch were also filmed -- this time for the big screen. And Jackie wrote an original movie, Yesterday\'s Hero, starring Ian McShane and Suzanne Somers.
Readers couldn\'t wait to race through Lucky, her next book -- a sequel to Chances -- and the story of an incredibly beautiful, strong woman, another New York Times number one.
Then came the bad boys of Hollywood in the steamy Hollywood Husbands -- a novel which kept everyone guessing the identities of the true-to-life Hollywood characters.
Jackie then wrote Rock Star -- the story of three rock superstars and their rise to the top, followed by the long-waited sequel to Chances and Lucky -- Lady Boss -- tracking the further adventures of the wild and powerful Lucky Santangelo as she takes control of a Hollywood studio.
Both Lucky and Chances were written and adapted for NBC television by Jackie, who also executive produced the highly successful six-hour miniseries Lucky/Chances, starring Nicollete Sheridan and Sandra Bullock.
In 1992, she produced and wrote the four hour miniseries, Lady Boss, which became another huge ratings success for NBC. Lady Boss starred Kim Delaney. Next came American Star, a love story, which the Los Angeles Times described as \""classic Collins.\""
And then the dangerously close to the truth Hollywood Kids -- a story of power, sex, danger and ambition among the grown offspring of major celebrities.
In 1996 Vendetta - Lucky\'s Revenge was published -- and became an immediate New York Times bestseller.
And then in 1998, Jackie hosted her own daily television show, Jackie Collins Hollywood. A combination of fun, style and interviews, Jackie talked to everyone from George Clooney to Jennifer Lopez.
After that she wrote L.A. Connections -- a four-part serial novel published one per month -- Power, Obsession, Murder and Revenge.
In 1999 came Dangerous Kiss -- the return of Lucky Santangelo in a bestselling novel about relationships, addiction, fear and lust.
In the year 2000, Lethal Seduction became the first bestseller for Jackie Collins in the new millennium. This tale of erotic suspense and glamorous intrigue featured Madison Castelli, a character first introduced in the L.A. Connections series.
Hollywood Wives - The New Generation became a blockbuster bestseller in 2001, following in the footsteps of the original Hollywood Wives. Hollywood Wives - The New Generation featured a brand new cast of characters and a totally fresh perspective on how women pursue power, love, sex, and success in Tinsletown today.
In 2003 Jackie produced the TV movie of Hollywood Wives - The New Generation for CBS. Wives starred Farrah Fawcett, Robin Givens, Jack Scalia and Melissa Gilbert.
In June 2002, New York flash, L.A. trash and a Mafia don meet head-on in Deadly Embrace. This sexy tale of dangerous passion and suspense features heroine Madison Castelli and is both a prequel and a sequel to her adventures in the bestselling Lethal Seduction.

Followed in 2005 by Lovers and Players -- a story of family conflicts, three brothers and their billionaire father, a beautiful heiress, a hip-hop mogul, Russian call girls, illegitimate children and two murders. This all takes place over seven days in New York, and is another New York Times bestseller.
Drop Dead Beautiful -- The Continuing Adventures of Lucky Santangelo was published in 2007. Lucky came back with a vengeance -- bolder and more beautiful than ever! In Drop Dead Beautiful Lucky meets old friends and enemies, and deals with her wild sixteen-year-old daughter, Max, who is as stubborn and strong as her mom.

Next came Married Lovers, a powerful look at the ins and outs of marriage in L.A. It\'s also the story of an under-age Russian girl who becomes involved in the sex trade, and eventually arrives in Hollywood and causes major trouble.
