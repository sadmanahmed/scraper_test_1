A dazzling, richly moving new novel by the internationally celebrated author of The God of Small Things
 
The Ministry of Utmost Happiness takes us on an intimate journey of many years across the Indian subcontinent—from the cramped neighborhoods of Old Delhi and the roads of the new city to the mountains and valleys of Kashmir and beyond, where war is peace and peace is war.
It is an aching love story and a decisive remonstration, a story told in a whisper, in a shout, through unsentimental tears and sometimes with a bitter laugh. Each of its characters is indelibly, tenderly rendered. Its heroes are people who have been broken by the world they live in and then rescued, patched together by acts of love—and by hope.
The tale begins with Anjum—who used to be Aftab—unrolling a threadbare Persian carpet in a city graveyard she calls home. We encounter the odd, unforgettable Tilo and the men who loved her—including Musa, sweetheart and ex-sweetheart, lover and ex-lover; their fates are as entwined as their arms used to be and always will be. We meet Tilo’s landlord, a former suitor, now an intelligence officer posted to Kabul. And then we meet the two Miss Jebeens: the first a child born in Srinagar and buried in its overcrowded Martyrs’ Graveyard; the second found at midnight, abandoned on a concrete sidewalk in the heart of New Delhi.
As this ravishing, deeply humane novel braids these lives together, it reinvents what a novel can do and can be. The Ministry of Utmost Happiness demonstrates on every page the miracle of Arundhati Roy’s storytelling gifts.",The Ministry of Utmost Happiness: A novel,Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Random House (Indian),9780143442769,"1st Edition,2017",464,India,English

Edmond Kirsch, a billionaire computer scientist and futurist, as well as a strident atheist, attends a meeting in Catalonia with Roman Catholic Bishop Antonio Valdespino, Jewish moragi Yehuda Köves, and Muslim Imam Syed al-Fadl, three members of the Parliament of the World's Religions. He informs them that he has made a revolutionary discovery that he plans to release to the public in a month. He is advising them out of supposed respect, despite his well-known hatred of organized religion which he blames for his mother's death. Horrified, the three learn that he is presenting it in three days' time, prompting Valdespino to send him a voicemail demanding that he stop or risk being discredited.

Nonetheless, Kirsch goes along with his plan, hosting the exclusive event at the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao. Among those in attendance are Kirsch's former teacher, Robert Langdon, and the Guggenheim's curator Ambra Vidal, who helped organize the event, and is the fiancee of the future King of Spain, Prince Julián. Before the event, the guests receive a headset through which they communicate with a voice named Winston, which reveals to Langdon that it is actually an artificial intelligence invented by Kirsch. Winston leads Langdon to a private meeting with Kirsch, who reveals that his presentation will provide the answers to two of life's most important questions: ""Where did we come from?"" and ""Where are we going?""",Origin,Dan Brown, , ,Penguin Random House (Indian), 9780593078754,"1st Edition,2017",544,India,English

This seemingly innocuous question was posed to Subir Chowdhury by one of his longtime clients, and ultimately lead him to a profound realization: good enough is not enough. The best processes in the world won't work without developing the kind of mindset — a caring mindset — that is needed to achieve real and sustainable change in both organizations and individuals.

In his compelling new book, bestselling author and globally recognized management consultant Subir Chowdhury tackles an issue that has haunted him in his work with many of the world’s largest organizations.  Why is it that some improve only incrementally, while others improve 50 times that? The ideas and training are exactly the same. What is the difference? 
 
The difference, Chowdhury explains, is the ability to nurture the skills, loyalty and passion of the people who make up an organization.  It is a culture built on straightforwardness, thoughtfulness, accountability and resolve.  Organizations and individuals that embrace all of these “STAR” attributes—not just one or two of them—will shine.  He goes further, showing us why having a caring mindset outside of work is integral to both personal and professional success.

In Bryson's biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand—and, if possible, answer—the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining.",A Short History Of Nearly Everything (A Journey Through Space and Time),Bill Bryson, , ,Penguin Random House (Indian),9781784161859,"1st Edition,2016",668,India,English

The Best Of Roald Dahl is a collection of short stories, which encompasses the best of Dahl’s literary works ever published during his writing career from the year 1945 to 1965.

The stories present in this book include Genesis And Catastrophe, Over to You, Mrs. Bixby And The Colonel’s Coat, Pig, The Visitor, Switch Bitch, Lamb To The Slaughter, Galloping Foxley, Edward The Conqueror, Man From The South, Someone Like You, Madame Rosette, William and Mary, Dip In The Pool, The Way Up To Heaven, Georgy Porgy, Royal Jelly, The Sound Machine, Taste, Parson's Pleasure, Claud’s Dog, and The Landlady.

In one of the stories, Man From The South, the readers are introduced to Carlos, an elderly man who dares an American boy to strike his lighter ten times consecutively, offering him his green Cadillac if he was able to do so. However, the boy would get his pinky chopped off, if he couldn’t strike the lighter ten times in a row. Another story in this book, Mrs. Bixby And The Colonel’s Coat keeps the reader highly amused. It’s based on Mrs. Bixby who had an affair with the Colonel living in Baltimore, whom she visited once every month. The Colonel gifts Mrs. Bixby a mink coat, which she can’t sell off, and is left in a mess as she fears her husband questioning her.

Apart from humor, The Best Of Roald Dahl also has a horror story, The Landlady, which revolves around a young man, who on a certain trip, drops by at a restroom where a highly optimistic landlady desires to put an end to his life. All in all, this series of short stories by Dahl is a must-have for individuals of all groups.

Hate, is a four letter word. So is love. And sometimes, people can’t tell the difference…
Dhurv and Aranya spend a good part of their lives trying to figure out why they want to destroy each other, why they hurt each other so deeply. And, why they can’t stay away from each other. 
The answer is just as difficult each time because all they’ve wanted is to do the worst, most miserable things to one another. 
Yet there is something that tells them: THIS IS NOT IT.

Along with his improbable name, untraceable accent and unmistakable air of danger, Nero Golden has brought along his three adult sons: agoraphobic, alcoholic Petya; Apu, the flamboyant artist; and D, who harbours an explosive secret even from himself. The story of the powerful Golden family is told from the point of view of their neighbour and confidant, Ren, an aspiring filmmaker who finds in the Goldens the perfect subject. Ren chronicles the undoing of the house of Golden: the high life of money, of art and fashion, a sibling quarrel, an unexpected metamorphosis, the arrival of a beautiful woman, betrayal and murder, and far away, in India, the unravelling of an insidious plot. Copiously detailed, sumptuously inventive, brimming with all the razzle-dazzle that imbues his fiction with the lush ambience of a fable, The Golden House is about where we were before 26/11, where we are today and how we got here. The result is a modern epic of love and terrorism, loss and reinvention-a powerful, timely story told with the daring and panache that make Salman Rushdie a force of light in our dark new age.",The Golden House,Salman Rushdie, , ,Penguin Random House (Indian),9780670090297,"1st Published,2017",370,India,English

A brief yet definitive new biography of one of film's greatest legends: perfect for readers who want to know more about the iconic star but who don't want to commit to a lengthy work.

He was the very first icon of the silver screen and is one of the most recognizable of Hollywood faces, even a hundred years after his first film. But what of the man behind the moustache? Peter Ackroyd's new biography turns the spotlight on Chaplin's life as well as his work, from his humble theatrical beginnings in music halls to winning an honorary Academy Award. Everything is here, from the glamor of his golden age to the murky scandals of the 1940s and eventual exile to Switzerland. There are charming anecdotes along the way: playing the violin in a New York hotel room to mask the sound of Stan Laurel frying pork chops and long Hollywood lunches with Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. This masterful brief biography offers fresh revelations about one of the most familiar faces of the last century and brings the Little Tramp vividly to life.

A dazzling, richly moving new novel by the internationally celebrated author of The God of Small Things
 
The Ministry of Utmost Happiness takes us on an intimate journey of many years across the Indian subcontinent—from the cramped neighborhoods of Old Delhi and the roads of the new city to the mountains and valleys of Kashmir and beyond, where war is peace and peace is war.
It is an aching love story and a decisive remonstration, a story told in a whisper, in a shout, through unsentimental tears and sometimes with a bitter laugh. Each of its characters is indelibly, tenderly rendered. Its heroes are people who have been broken by the world they live in and then rescued, patched together by acts of love—and by hope.
The tale begins with Anjum—who used to be Aftab—unrolling a threadbare Persian carpet in a city graveyard she calls home. We encounter the odd, unforgettable Tilo and the men who loved her—including Musa, sweetheart and ex-sweetheart, lover and ex-lover; their fates are as entwined as their arms used to be and always will be. We meet Tilo’s landlord, a former suitor, now an intelligence officer posted to Kabul. And then we meet the two Miss Jebeens: the first a child born in Srinagar and buried in its overcrowded Martyrs’ Graveyard; the second found at midnight, abandoned on a concrete sidewalk in the heart of New Delhi.
As this ravishing, deeply humane novel braids these lives together, it reinvents what a novel can do and can be.

Edmond Kirsch, a billionaire computer scientist and futurist, as well as a strident atheist, attends a meeting in Catalonia with Roman Catholic Bishop Antonio Valdespino, Jewish moragi Yehuda Köves, and Muslim Imam Syed al-Fadl, three members of the Parliament of the World's Religions. He informs them that he has made a revolutionary discovery that he plans to release to the public in a month. He is advising them out of supposed respect, despite his well-known hatred of organized religion which he blames for his mother's death. Horrified, the three learn that he is presenting it in three days' time, prompting Valdespino to send him a voicemail demanding that he stop or risk being discredited.

Nonetheless, Kirsch goes along with his plan, hosting the exclusive event at the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao. Among those in attendance are Kirsch's former teacher, Robert Langdon, and the Guggenheim's curator Ambra Vidal, who helped organize the event, and is the fiancee of the future King of Spain, Prince Julián. Before the event, the guests receive a headset through which they communicate with a voice named Winston, which reveals to Langdon that it is actually an artificial intelligence invented by Kirsch. Winston leads Langdon to a private meeting with Kirsch, who reveals that his presentation will provide the answers to two of life's most important questions: ""Where did we come from?"" and ""Where are we going?""",Origin,Dan Brown, , ,Penguin Random House (Indian), 9780593078754,"1st Edition,2017",544,India,English

This seemingly innocuous question was posed to Subir Chowdhury by one of his longtime clients, and ultimately lead him to a profound realization: good enough is not enough. The best processes in the world won't work without developing the kind of mindset — a caring mindset — that is needed to achieve real and sustainable change in both organizations and individuals.

In his compelling new book, bestselling author and globally recognized management consultant Subir Chowdhury tackles an issue that has haunted him in his work with many of the world’s largest organizations.  Why is it that some improve only incrementally, while others improve 50 times that? The ideas and training are exactly the same. What is the difference? 
 
The difference, Chowdhury explains, is the ability to nurture the skills, loyalty and passion of the people who make up an organization.  It is a culture built on straightforwardness, thoughtfulness, accountability and resolve.  Organizations and individuals that embrace all of these “STAR” attributes—not just one or two of them—will shine.  He goes further, showing us why having a caring mindset outside of work is integral to both personal and professional success.

He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds.

In one of the stories, Man From The South, the readers are introduced to Carlos, an elderly man who dares an American boy to strike his lighter ten times consecutively, offering him his green Cadillac if he was able to do so.

Hate, is a four letter word. So is love. And sometimes, people can’t tell the difference…
Dhurv and Aranya spend a good part of their lives trying to figure out why they want to destroy each other, why they hurt each other so deeply. And, why they can’t stay away from each other. 
The answer is just as difficult each time because all they’ve wanted is to do the worst, most miserable things to one another. 
Yet there is something that tells them: THIS IS NOT IT.
If you want to know the answer to it all, read the book.",World's Best Boyfriend,Durjoy Datta, , ,Penguin Random House (Indian),9780143424635,"1st Edition,2015",288,India,English

Along with his improbable name, untraceable accent and unmistakable air of danger, Nero Golden has brought along his three adult sons: agoraphobic, alcoholic Petya; Apu, the flamboyant artist; and D, who harbours an explosive secret even from himself. The story of the powerful Golden family is told from the point of view of their neighbour and confidant, Ren, an aspiring filmmaker who finds in the Goldens the perfect subject. Ren chronicles the undoing of the house of Golden: the high life of money, of art and fashion, a sibling quarrel, an unexpected metamorphosis, the arrival of a beautiful woman, betrayal and murder, and far away, in India, the unravelling of an insidious plot. Copiously detailed, sumptuously inventive, brimming with all the razzle-dazzle that imbues his fiction with the lush ambience of a fable, The Golden House is about where we were before 26/11, where we are today and how we got here. The result is a modern epic of love and terrorism, loss and reinvention-a powerful, timely story told with the daring and panache that make Salman Rushdie a force of light in our dark new age.",The Golden House,Salman Rushdie, , ,Penguin Random House (Indian),9780670090297,"1st Published,2017",370,India,English

A brief yet definitive new biography of one of film's greatest legends: perfect for readers who want to know more about the iconic star but who don't want to commit to a lengthy work.

He was the very first icon of the silver screen and is one of the most recognizable of Hollywood faces, even a hundred years after his first film. But what of the man behind the moustache? Peter Ackroyd's new biography turns the spotlight on Chaplin's life as well as his work, from his humble theatrical beginnings in music halls to winning an honorary Academy Award. Everything is here, from the glamor of his golden age to the murky scandals of the 1940s and eventual exile to Switzerland. There are charming anecdotes along the way: playing the violin in a New York hotel room to mask the sound of Stan Laurel frying pork chops and long Hollywood lunches with Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. This masterful brief biography offers fresh revelations about one of the most familiar faces of the last century and brings the Little Tramp vividly to life.
