I came to know about Gaur Gopal Das Ji when I came across one of his videos on YouTube. I was really fascinated by his thoughts and her teachings. So, I researched books written by him and bought Life’s Amazing Secrets online from Amazon. I am really glad I did it because the insights, examples and the story are simple to understand and are life-changing if one truly understands the motive behind the same.

So, in this book, Gaur Gopal Das Ji talks about the 4 principles that form the foundation of a happy life. These are Personal life, Relationships, Work life, and Social Contribution. He talks how to keep them balanced to live a life full of values and happiness.

This book is filled with precious insights and a lot of examples of how to live life with purpose and in a balanced manner. Every chapter starts with a beautiful quote by legendary people and ends with a summary of the chapter.

Overall, it’s been a book that I can pick up anytime I feel low or out of balance. It’s written beautifully and presented well. The language is quite easy and it is neither fast-paced nor slow. I read this book in 2 sittings as I was truly gripped by it and it wasn’t easy to put this down. So, I must say that it is quite engaging. I highly suggest you buy a Life’s Amazing Secrets.

Inspired by a long-forgotten ballad, two young pigs decide to exact vengeance on their corrupt human rulers. They lead the other farm animals in an epic battle as they oust the farmer and his family, seizing control over the farm. They declare that there will be no more meaningless labour, and that all animals are created equal. However, their “government” soon begins to fall apart as they begin displaying their mistrust for one another. In their attempts to be different from their human masters, they begin to slowly follow their edicts, and slowly their ideals shift. In Animal Farm, there is only one thing that you must remember.

On her thirteenth birthday, Anne Frank’s parents give her a diary. She’s excited because she wants someone—or something—in which to confide all of her secret thoughts. Even though she has a rich social life, she feels misunderstood by everyone she knows. Anne starts writing about daily events, her thoughts, school grades, boys, all that.

But, within a month, her entire life changes.

As Jews in German-occupied Holland, the Frank family fears for their lives. When Anne’s sister, Margot, is called to appear before the authorities—which would almost surely mean she was being sent to a concentration camp—Anne and her family go into hiding. They move into a little section of Anne's father's office building that is walled off and hidden behind a swinging bookcase. The little diagram of the office building and ""Secret Annex"" in the Thursday, July 9, 1942 entry gives us the layout.

For two years, the Frank family lives in this Secret Annex. Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and their son Peter (who is a few years older than Anne) are also in hiding with the Franks. Later, Mr. Dussel (an elderly dentist) moves in, and Anne has to share her bedroom with him. Anne’s adolescence is spent hidden from the outside world. She’s cooped up in tiny rooms, tiptoeing around during the day and becoming shell-shocked from the sounds of bombs and gunfire at night. 

Luckily, the Franks have tons of reading material and a radio. Anne grows in her knowledge of politics and literature, and she puts tons of energy into studying and writing. At the same time, she grows further and further away from the other members of the Annex.

We see a real change in Anne when she begins hanging out in the attic with Peter van Daan. Around this time she starts having dreams about a boy she was in love with, another Peter: Peter Schiff. She sometimes even gets the two Peters confused in her head.

She comes to see Peter (of the Annex) as much more than she first thought. She finds him sensitive and caring, and they talk about everything, including sex. Eventually their relationship changes. Anne and Peter’s passion turns into a friendship and a source of comfort for them both.

Another big change for Anne happens when the war seems to be ending. She hears that personal accounts such as her diary will be in demand after the war ends. We see a return to her earlier optimism as she begins editing her diary with vigor and excitement.

Unfortunately, this does not last. Even as Anne becomes more and more sensitive to the suffering going on in the world, her own suffering becomes unbearable. She feels completely alone. She thinks everyone hates her. She feels constantly criticized. And there is no escape. At one point, she thinks it might have been better if she and her family had all died instead of hiding in the Annex. As Anne becomes harder on those around her, she also becomes harder on herself, berating herself for being mean to the other members of the Annex. 

There her diary ends. Two short months after Anne’s fifteenth birthday, and two days after he last diary entry, the Secret Annex is raided. We don’t know Anne’s thoughts or feelings at that point or any time after, but we know things got worse.

As you probably already know, Anne and the other members of the Annex were sent to various concentration camps. Anne's father, Otto Frank, was the sole survivor.(shmoop.com)",The Diary of A Young Girl,Anne Frank, , ,PENGUIN INDIA,9780141007212,"1st Edition,2001",432,India,English

Summary of The Book:

She Broke Up, I Didn’t! is a novel that takes a nasty dig at relationships, love and fidelity and what it means today. It tackles some of the very uncomfortable questions and tries to put those into perspective.

In 1026, Mahmud of Ghazni raided the temple of Somanatha. The history of this raid and subsequent events at the site have been reconstructed in the last couple of centuries largely on the basis of the Turko-Persian sources. There were other sources that also refer to events at Somanatha throughout a period of almost a thousand years, but these have rarely been quoted when reconstructing this history. Until very recent times, there were few attempts to either juxtapose or integrate these other texts in order to arrive at a more complete understanding of the history of Somanatha. Such sources include local Sanskrit inscriptions, biographies of kings and merchants written from a Jaina perspective, epics of Rajput-Turkish relations composed at various Rajput courts and popular narratives of the activities of pirs and gurus, all of which, in some way, have a bearing on the history of Somanatha.
This book is an attempt to draw together these numerous voices, to view the sources comparatively, but above all to place each narrative in a historical se context. This also involves exploring why a particular, and often distinctive, perspective was adopted by each. It suggests a different history of Somanatha from the one that has been projected through the last two centuries. It also effectively underlines the significance of examining the historical perceptions of how authors present events, both in the narratives written in the past and in the interpretations of past events in present times,",Somanatha: The Many Voices of a History,Romila Thapar, , ,PENGUIN INDIA,9780143064688,"1st Published,2008",260,India,English

High above the sky stands Swarga, paradise, abode of the gods. Still above is Vaikuntha, heaven, abode of God.

The doorkeepers of Vaikuntha are the twins, Jaya and Vijaya, both whose names mean 'victory'. One keeps you in Swarga; the other raises you into Vaikuntha.

In Vaikuntha there is bliss forever, in Swarga there is pleasure for only as long as you deserve. What is the difference between Jaya and Vijaya? Solve this puzzle and you will solve the mystery of the Mahabharata.

In this enthralling retelling of India's greatest epic, the Mahabharata originally known as Jaya, Devdutt Pattanaik seamlessly weaves into a single narrative plots from the Sanskrit classic as well as its many folk and regional variants, including the Pandavani of Chhattisgarh, Gondhal of Maharashtra, Terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu and Yakshagana of Karnataka.

Richly illustrated with over 250 line drawings by the author, the 108 chapters abound with little-known details such as the names of the hundred Kauravas, the worship of Draupadi as a goddess in Tamil Nadu, the stories of Astika, Madhavi, Jaimini, Aravan and Barbareek, the Mahabharata version of the Shakuntalam and the Ramayana, and the dating of the war based on astronomical data.

With clarity and simplicity, the tales in this elegant volume reveal the eternal relevance of the Mahabharata, the complex and disturbing meditation on the human condition that has shaped Indian thought for over 3000 years. (goodreads.com)

Rama was the eldest son of Dasharatha, the King of Ayodhya. When Rama came of age, Dasharatha wanted to hand over the reins of the kingdom to him, but his second wife Kaikeyi was jealous and wanted to make her son Bharata king. She invoked two long-forgotten boons from Dasharatha, and forced him to exile Rama into the forests for fourteen years. Determined to stick to dharma and stay true to his father’s word, the noble Rama leaves Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his younger brother Lakshmana to live in the forests for fourteen years. However, he draws the attention of the demonic lord of Lanka, the evil Ravana who desires to steal Sita for himself. Ravana hatches a plan and kidnaps Sita when Rama and Lakshmana are away. Rama is grief-stricken and begins to journey towards Lanka to fight Ravana for Sita’s pride. He will not have to go alone, for a band of the most curious monkeys decide to accompany him. And among them is the devout Hanuman, the son of the Wind God. Hanuman will do anything to return Sita to Rama’s arms, and together they will bring a war to Ravana’s walls which will forever be remembered in history through the words of the mythic sage Valmiki.

I came to know about Gaur Gopal Das Ji when I came across one of his videos on YouTube. I was really fascinated by his thoughts and her teachings. So, I researched books written by him and bought Life’s Amazing Secrets online from Amazon. I am really glad I did it because the insights, examples and the story are simple to understand and are life-changing if one truly understands the motive behind the same.

So, in this book, Gaur Gopal Das Ji talks about the 4 principles that form the foundation of a happy life. These are Personal life, Relationships, Work life, and Social Contribution. He talks how to keep them balanced to live a life full of values and happiness.

This book is filled with precious insights and a lot of examples of how to live life with purpose and in a balanced manner. Every chapter starts with a beautiful quote by legendary people and ends with a summary of the chapter.

Overall, it’s been a book that I can pick up anytime I feel low or out of balance. It’s written beautifully and presented well. The language is quite easy and it is neither fast-paced nor slow. I read this book in 2 sittings as I was truly gripped by it and it wasn’t easy to put this down. So, I must say that it is quite engaging. I highly suggest you buy a Life’s Amazing Secrets.

However, their “government” soon begins to fall apart as they begin displaying their mistrust for one another.

On her thirteenth birthday, Anne Frank’s parents give her a diary. She’s excited because she wants someone—or something—in which to confide all of her secret thoughts. Even though she has a rich social life, she feels misunderstood by everyone she knows. Anne starts writing about daily events, her thoughts, school grades, boys, all that.

But, within a month, her entire life changes.

As Jews in German-occupied Holland, the Frank family fears for their lives. When Anne’s sister, Margot, is called to appear before the authorities—which would almost surely mean she was being sent to a concentration camp—Anne and her family go into hiding. They move into a little section of Anne's father's office building that is walled off and hidden behind a swinging bookcase. The little diagram of the office building and ""Secret Annex"" in the Thursday, July 9, 1942 entry gives us the layout.

For two years, the Frank family lives in this Secret Annex. Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and their son Peter (who is a few years older than Anne) are also in hiding with the Franks. Later, Mr. Dussel (an elderly dentist) moves in, and Anne has to share her bedroom with him. Anne’s adolescence is spent hidden from the outside world. She’s cooped up in tiny rooms, tiptoeing around during the day and becoming shell-shocked from the sounds of bombs and gunfire at night. 

Luckily, the Franks have tons of reading material and a radio. Anne grows in her knowledge of politics and literature, and she puts tons of energy into studying and writing. At the same time, she grows further and further away from the other members of the Annex.

We see a real change in Anne when she begins hanging out in the attic with Peter van Daan. Around this time she starts having dreams about a boy she was in love with, another Peter: Peter Schiff. She sometimes even gets the two Peters confused in her head.

She comes to see Peter (of the Annex) as much more than she first thought. She finds him sensitive and caring, and they talk about everything, including sex. Eventually their relationship changes. Anne and Peter’s passion turns into a friendship and a source of comfort for them both.

Another big change for Anne happens when the war seems to be ending. She hears that personal accounts such as her diary will be in demand after the war ends. We see a return to her earlier optimism as she begins editing her diary with vigor and excitement.

Unfortunately, this does not last. Even as Anne becomes more and more sensitive to the suffering going on in the world, her own suffering becomes unbearable. She feels completely alone. She thinks everyone hates her. She feels constantly criticized. And there is no escape. At one point, she thinks it might have been better if she and her family had all died instead of hiding in the Annex. As Anne becomes harder on those around her, she also becomes harder on herself, berating herself for being mean to the other members of the Annex. 

There her diary ends. Two short months after Anne’s fifteenth birthday, and two days after he last diary entry, the Secret Annex is raided. We don’t know Anne’s thoughts or feelings at that point or any time after, but we know things got worse.

As you probably already know, Anne and the other members of the Annex were sent to various concentration camps. Anne's father, Otto Frank, was the sole survivor.(shmoop.com)",The Diary of A Young Girl,Anne Frank, , ,PENGUIN INDIA,9780141007212,"1st Edition,2001",432,India,English

Summary of The Book:

She Broke Up, I Didn’t! is a novel that takes a nasty dig at relationships, love and fidelity and what it means today. It tackles some of the very uncomfortable questions and tries to put those into perspective.

It’s the story of Deb and Avantika, , two management students whose pretty as a picture life is is thrown off track, after Deb, drunk as a pig goes ahead and kisses a classmate. To forgive is divine? Especially when it is just a mistake!

What will Avantika do? Will she be able to forgive him?

And what if Deb does it again? What if Avantika goes ahead and does the same?

This is the story of a group of friends who battle the questions of infidelity, loyalty and love as they step out of their colleges.

Is lust different from love? Are girls more tolerant?

What would hurt you more?

Your partner writing a love song for someone else? Or sleeping with someone else?

Is the answer any different for the two sexes?","She Broke Up,I Didn't!: I Just Kissed Someone Else!",Durjoy Datta, , ,PENGUIN INDIA,9780143421597,"1st Edition,2013",236,India,English

In 1026, Mahmud of Ghazni raided the temple of Somanatha. The history of this raid and subsequent events at the site have been reconstructed in the last couple of centuries largely on the basis of the Turko-Persian sources. There were other sources that also refer to events at Somanatha throughout a period of almost a thousand years, but these have rarely been quoted when reconstructing this history. Until very recent times, there were few attempts to either juxtapose or integrate these other texts in order to arrive at a more complete understanding of the history of Somanatha. Such sources include local Sanskrit inscriptions, biographies of kings and merchants written from a Jaina perspective, epics of Rajput-Turkish relations composed at various Rajput courts and popular narratives of the activities of pirs and gurus, all of which, in some way, have a bearing on the history of Somanatha.
This book is an attempt to draw together these numerous voices, to view the sources comparatively, but above all to place each narrative in a historical se context. This also involves exploring why a particular, and often distinctive, perspective was adopted by each. It suggests a different history of Somanatha from the one that has been projected through the last two centuries. It also effectively underlines the significance of examining the historical perceptions of how authors present events, both in the narratives written in the past and in the interpretations of past events in present times,",Somanatha: The Many Voices of a History,Romila Thapar, , ,PENGUIN INDIA,9780143064688,"1st Published,2008",260,India,English

High above the sky stands Swarga, paradise, abode of the gods. Still above is Vaikuntha, heaven, abode of God.

The doorkeepers of Vaikuntha are the twins, Jaya and Vijaya, both whose names mean 'victory'. One keeps you in Swarga; the other raises you into Vaikuntha.

In Vaikuntha there is bliss forever, in Swarga there is pleasure for only as long as you deserve. What is the difference between Jaya and Vijaya? Solve this puzzle and you will solve the mystery of the Mahabharata.

In this enthralling retelling of India's greatest epic, the Mahabharata originally known as Jaya, Devdutt Pattanaik seamlessly weaves into a single narrative plots from the Sanskrit classic as well as its many folk and regional variants, including the Pandavani of Chhattisgarh, Gondhal of Maharashtra, Terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu and Yakshagana of Karnataka.

Richly illustrated with over 250 line drawings by the author, the 108 chapters abound with little-known details such as the names of the hundred Kauravas, the worship of Draupadi as a goddess in Tamil Nadu, the stories of Astika, Madhavi, Jaimini, Aravan and Barbareek, the Mahabharata version of the Shakuntalam and the Ramayana, and the dating of the war based on astronomical data.

With clarity and simplicity, the tales in this elegant volume reveal the eternal relevance of the Mahabharata, the complex and disturbing meditation on the human condition that has shaped Indian thought for over 3000 years. (goodreads.com)

Rama was the eldest son of Dasharatha, the King of Ayodhya. When Rama came of age, Dasharatha wanted to hand over the reins of the kingdom to him, but his second wife Kaikeyi was jealous and wanted to make her son Bharata king. She invoked two long-forgotten boons from Dasharatha, and forced him to exile Rama into the forests for fourteen years. Determined to stick to dharma and stay true to his father’s word, the noble Rama leaves Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his younger brother Lakshmana to live in the forests for fourteen years. However, he draws the attention of the demonic lord of Lanka, the evil Ravana who desires to steal Sita for himself. Ravana hatches a plan and kidnaps Sita when Rama and Lakshmana are away. Rama is grief-stricken and begins to journey towards Lanka to fight Ravana for Sita’s pride. He will not have to go alone, for a band of the most curious monkeys decide to accompany him. And among them is the devout Hanuman, the son of the Wind God. Hanuman will do anything to return Sita to Rama’s arms, and together they will bring a war to Ravana’s walls which will forever be remembered in history through the words of the mythic sage Valmiki.

In his early twenties now, Rusty finally severs ties with Dehra and books a passage to England, with the dream of writing and selling his novel abroad. First in his aunt's house in Jersey, and then in rented lodgings in London, he works as a clerk by day and writes away in the evenings. Eventually the novel is finished and Rusty even finds a publisher. But this, he discovers, does not mean that his book will see the light of day soon ...

While in London, Rusty has myriad adventures, each more incredible than the last. Strolling down Baker Street, he runs into Sherlock Holmes, who gives him a few lessons in investigative techniques. At the Victoria and Albert Museum, he is accosted by Rudyard Kipling. And then, of course, there is the strange incident at the Chinese quarter, the Calypso Christmas in his lodgings, and the story of the Vietnamese girl Vu-Phuong.

After three years abroad, however, Rusty realizes that he wants to make India his permanent home; all he really needs is a room of his own to live and write in, as the vibrant world that he has known and loved all along unfolds outside. Returning to Dehra, he renews some acquaintances and makes a few new ones, and settles into his role as full-time author.

I came to know about Gaur Gopal Das Ji when I came across one of his videos on YouTube. I was really fascinated by his thoughts and her teachings. So, I researched books written by him and bought Life’s Amazing Secrets online from Amazon. I am really glad I did it because the insights, examples and the story are simple to understand and are life-changing if one truly understands the motive behind the same.

So, in this book, Gaur Gopal Das Ji talks about the 4 principles that form the foundation of a happy life. These are Personal life, Relationships, Work life, and Social Contribution. He talks how to keep them balanced to live a life full of values and happiness.

This book is filled with precious insights and a lot of examples of how to live life with purpose and in a balanced manner. Every chapter starts with a beautiful quote by legendary people and ends with a summary of the chapter.

Overall, it’s been a book that I can pick up anytime I feel low or out of balance. It’s written beautifully and presented well. The language is quite easy and it is neither fast-paced nor slow. I read this book in 2 sittings as I was truly gripped by it and it wasn’t easy to put this down. So, I must say that it is quite engaging. I highly suggest you buy a Life’s Amazing Secrets.

However, their “government” soon begins to fall apart as they begin displaying their mistrust for one another.

On her thirteenth birthday, Anne Frank’s parents give her a diary. She’s excited because she wants someone—or something—in which to confide all of her secret thoughts. Even though she has a rich social life, she feels misunderstood by everyone she knows. Anne starts writing about daily events, her thoughts, school grades, boys, all that.

But, within a month, her entire life changes.

As Jews in German-occupied Holland, the Frank family fears for their lives. When Anne’s sister, Margot, is called to appear before the authorities—which would almost surely mean she was being sent to a concentration camp—Anne and her family go into hiding. They move into a little section of Anne's father's office building that is walled off and hidden behind a swinging bookcase. The little diagram of the office building and ""Secret Annex"" in the Thursday, July 9, 1942 entry gives us the layout.

For two years, the Frank family lives in this Secret Annex. Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and their son Peter (who is a few years older than Anne) are also in hiding with the Franks. Later, Mr. Dussel (an elderly dentist) moves in, and Anne has to share her bedroom with him. Anne’s adolescence is spent hidden from the outside world. She’s cooped up in tiny rooms, tiptoeing around during the day and becoming shell-shocked from the sounds of bombs and gunfire at night. 

Luckily, the Franks have tons of reading material and a radio. Anne grows in her knowledge of politics and literature, and she puts tons of energy into studying and writing. At the same time, she grows further and further away from the other members of the Annex.

We see a real change in Anne when she begins hanging out in the attic with Peter van Daan. Around this time she starts having dreams about a boy she was in love with, another Peter: Peter Schiff. She sometimes even gets the two Peters confused in her head.

She comes to see Peter (of the Annex) as much more than she first thought. She finds him sensitive and caring, and they talk about everything, including sex. Eventually their relationship changes. Anne and Peter’s passion turns into a friendship and a source of comfort for them both.

Another big change for Anne happens when the war seems to be ending. She hears that personal accounts such as her diary will be in demand after the war ends. We see a return to her earlier optimism as she begins editing her diary with vigor and excitement.

Unfortunately, this does not last. Even as Anne becomes more and more sensitive to the suffering going on in the world, her own suffering becomes unbearable. She feels completely alone. She thinks everyone hates her. She feels constantly criticized. And there is no escape. At one point, she thinks it might have been better if she and her family had all died instead of hiding in the Annex. As Anne becomes harder on those around her, she also becomes harder on herself, berating herself for being mean to the other members of the Annex. 

There her diary ends. Two short months after Anne’s fifteenth birthday, and two days after he last diary entry, the Secret Annex is raided. We don’t know Anne’s thoughts or feelings at that point or any time after, but we know things got worse.

As you probably already know, Anne and the other members of the Annex were sent to various concentration camps. Anne's father, Otto Frank, was the sole survivor.(shmoop.com)",The Diary of A Young Girl,Anne Frank, , ,PENGUIN INDIA,9780141007212,"1st Edition,2001",432,India,English

Summary of The Book:

She Broke Up, I Didn’t! is a novel that takes a nasty dig at relationships, love and fidelity and what it means today. It tackles some of the very uncomfortable questions and tries to put those into perspective.

It’s the story of Deb and Avantika, , two management students whose pretty as a picture life is is thrown off track, after Deb, drunk as a pig goes ahead and kisses a classmate. To forgive is divine? Especially when it is just a mistake!

What will Avantika do? Will she be able to forgive him?

And what if Deb does it again? What if Avantika goes ahead and does the same?

This is the story of a group of friends who battle the questions of infidelity, loyalty and love as they step out of their colleges.

Is lust different from love? Are girls more tolerant?

What would hurt you more?

Your partner writing a love song for someone else? Or sleeping with someone else?

Is the answer any different for the two sexes?","She Broke Up,I Didn't!: I Just Kissed Someone Else!",Durjoy Datta, , ,PENGUIN INDIA,9780143421597,"1st Edition,2013",236,India,English

In 1026, Mahmud of Ghazni raided the temple of Somanatha. The history of this raid and subsequent events at the site have been reconstructed in the last couple of centuries largely on the basis of the Turko-Persian sources. There were other sources that also refer to events at Somanatha throughout a period of almost a thousand years, but these have rarely been quoted when reconstructing this history. Until very recent times, there were few attempts to either juxtapose or integrate these other texts in order to arrive at a more complete understanding of the history of Somanatha. Such sources include local Sanskrit inscriptions, biographies of kings and merchants written from a Jaina perspective, epics of Rajput-Turkish relations composed at various Rajput courts and popular narratives of the activities of pirs and gurus, all of which, in some way, have a bearing on the history of Somanatha.
This book is an attempt to draw together these numerous voices, to view the sources comparatively, but above all to place each narrative in a historical se context. This also involves exploring why a particular, and often distinctive, perspective was adopted by each. It suggests a different history of Somanatha from the one that has been projected through the last two centuries. It also effectively underlines the significance of examining the historical perceptions of how authors present events, both in the narratives written in the past and in the interpretations of past events in present times,",Somanatha: The Many Voices of a History,Romila Thapar, , ,PENGUIN INDIA,9780143064688,"1st Published,2008",260,India,English

High above the sky stands Swarga, paradise, abode of the gods. Still above is Vaikuntha, heaven, abode of God.

The doorkeepers of Vaikuntha are the twins, Jaya and Vijaya, both whose names mean 'victory'. One keeps you in Swarga; the other raises you into Vaikuntha.

In Vaikuntha there is bliss forever, in Swarga there is pleasure for only as long as you deserve. What is the difference between Jaya and Vijaya? Solve this puzzle and you will solve the mystery of the Mahabharata.

In this enthralling retelling of India's greatest epic, the Mahabharata originally known as Jaya, Devdutt Pattanaik seamlessly weaves into a single narrative plots from the Sanskrit classic as well as its many folk and regional variants, including the Pandavani of Chhattisgarh, Gondhal of Maharashtra, Terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu and Yakshagana of Karnataka.

Richly illustrated with over 250 line drawings by the author, the 108 chapters abound with little-known details such as the names of the hundred Kauravas, the worship of Draupadi as a goddess in Tamil Nadu, the stories of Astika, Madhavi, Jaimini, Aravan and Barbareek, the Mahabharata version of the Shakuntalam and the Ramayana, and the dating of the war based on astronomical data.

With clarity and simplicity, the tales in this elegant volume reveal the eternal relevance of the Mahabharata, the complex and disturbing meditation on the human condition that has shaped Indian thought for over 3000 years. (goodreads.com)

Rama was the eldest son of Dasharatha, the King of Ayodhya. When Rama came of age, Dasharatha wanted to hand over the reins of the kingdom to him, but his second wife Kaikeyi was jealous and wanted to make her son Bharata king. She invoked two long-forgotten boons from Dasharatha, and forced him to exile Rama into the forests for fourteen years. Determined to stick to dharma and stay true to his father’s word, the noble Rama leaves Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his younger brother Lakshmana to live in the forests for fourteen years. However, he draws the attention of the demonic lord of Lanka, the evil Ravana who desires to steal Sita for himself. Ravana hatches a plan and kidnaps Sita when Rama and Lakshmana are away. Rama is grief-stricken and begins to journey towards Lanka to fight Ravana for Sita’s pride. He will not have to go alone, for a band of the most curious monkeys decide to accompany him. And among them is the devout Hanuman, the son of the Wind God. Hanuman will do anything to return Sita to Rama’s arms, and together they will bring a war to Ravana’s walls which will forever be remembered in history through the words of the mythic sage Valmiki.

First in his aunt's house in Jersey, and then in rented lodgings in London, he works as a clerk by day and writes away in the evenings. Eventually the novel is finished and Rusty even finds a publisher. But this, he discovers, does not mean that his book will see the light of day soon ...

At the Victoria and Albert Museum, he is accosted by Rudyard Kipling. And then, of course, there is the strange incident at the Chinese quarter, the Calypso Christmas in his lodgings, and the story of the Vietnamese girl Vu-Phuong.

After three years abroad, however, Rusty realizes that he wants to make India his permanent home; all he really needs is a room of his own to live and write in, as the vibrant world that he has known and loved all along unfolds outside.
