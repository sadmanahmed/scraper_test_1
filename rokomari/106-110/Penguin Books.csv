“The Starry Night” shows Sexton’s identification with another tortured and suicidal artist, Vincent van Gogh. The short, free-verse poem begins with an epigraph from one of van Gogh’s letters to his brother. “That does not keep me from having a terrible need of—shall I say the word—religion,” van Gogh wrote. “Then I go out at night to paint the stars.” Sexton used epigraphs from a variety of works to begin her poems, and the epigraphs are often of major importance, pointing to a main theme of the poem that might otherwise be overlooked. Here she is indicating that she shares not only the mental imbalance, suicidal tendencies, and artistic nature of the Dutch artist but also his unsatisfied desire for the spiritual.

When van Gogh wrote the letter to his brother, he was painting the masterpiece Starry Night on the Rhone, which is described in the poem. The painting captures the night sky in blues and blacks, with a swirl of violent orange representing the moon, and burning yellow-white stars. One would expect a peaceful scene from the title, but this painting is intensely disquieting. The movement seems to be a great rush skyward, the sleeping town beneath the sky unconscious of this spiraling of all nature toward infinity. Sexton sees this painting as a reflection of her own death wish. The dark tree at the edge of the painting is described as “black-haired”—Sexton was a brunette—and it “slips/ up like a drowned woman into the hot sky.” To make her meaning clearer, she continues, “This is how/ I want to die.”

The poem interprets the painting as presenting a nature that is animate and hostile. Nevertheless, the picture attracts the speaker, because nature’s brute force promises death, release from the burden of self. Sexton sees the central moon image in the painting as a great dragon that will suck her up into its being. She desires, she says, “to split/ from my life with no flag,/ no belly,/ no cry”—to merge silently and painlessly with the infinite. The images may suggest not a rediscovery of religion but a terrifying substitute for it. Part of the appeal of this poem lies in the vivid interpretation of the painting and in the kinship the reader sees between Sexton and van Gogh.",Starry Nights,Shobhaa De, , ,Penguin Books,9780143421313,"1st Edition,2013",315,India,English

In this engagingly candid memoir, a woman who has been a familiar face and name to millions (although few know her) finally reveals the true self behind the public persona. Insiders know that besides her commitment to work and the frantic pace of her life, Shobhaa Dé's first priority in life has always been her family. Here she writes poignantly of her early years, and of her relationship with her parents and siblings, her husband and her children. Shobha De's high voltage career 'happened' in unexpected ways, starting with her unplanned entry as a teenager into the glamorous world of modeling, and moving on to her high-profile years as a magazine editor. In these avatars she keenly observed and astutely chronicled the new India— brash, affluent and ambitious. High-society hi-jinks, movie star follies, celebrity neurosis— none of these escaped her unsparing eye. And now she tells it all, just as it was, just as she saw it. In her inimitably forthright fashion, she writes of the choices she made, the decisions she took and the influences that shaped her.

One Hundred Years Of Solitude, a literary masterpiece by the Nobel Laureate, is a metaphoric mirror to Colombian history. The contemplative novel drapes the tale of the rise and fall of Macondo and magically captures the life and times of the Buendia family over seven generations.  

Summary Of The Book:
Set in a fictional town called Macondo in Northern Colombia, One Hundred Years Of Solitude begins with Jose Arcadio Buendia leaving his hometown with his wife Ursula, in search of a better life. One night during their journey, they happen to camp at a riverside where Jose dreams about a spectacular city and decides to establish one on the same riverbank. Thus, he builds Macondo and slowly shapes it into how he wants a city to be. Macondo then begins to miraculously attract unusual people and extraordinary events that make for a gripping plot. The adventurous Buendias find themselves in the middle of some of the most historically potent 
circumstances in Colombia. As the lineage stands in the face of the glory and downfall of a civilization, Marquez's lyrical magic manifests the delicate nuances of love and war, youth and senility, and passion and lust. And finally, what had started as an innocent dream of Jose, Ursula and 19 other families gradually break down and fall prey to lawless anarchy. 

One Hundred Years Of Solitude also chronicles the political and economic developments of the 19th century Colombia, such as corruption and capitalism with a touch of fiction. In a deeply touching and thought provoking non-linear narrative, Marquez paints a hundred years of history on the canvas of time. He uses his prerogative of having witnessed the wave of the Colombian revolution to graphically depict its lasting influence. He arrests in prose, the magical realism surrounding life, death, peace and the truth of mankind. 

Written originally in Spanish, One Hundred Years Of Solitude was published first in 1967. It has since been translated into 37 languages and sold more than 20 million copies worldover. A recipient of global acclaim and numerous awards, the book won Marquez his Nobel Prize in 1982.

The book starts with Greg writing about how his mother is always saying that ""friends will come and go but family is forever."" Greg doesn't believe that, since his friend, Rowley, now has a girlfriend named Abigail, continuing from the events of the last book. Ever since then, Rowley has been acting different, such as refusing to hang out with Greg and agreeing with everything Abigail says.

Greg has been getting bored without Rowley, so his mother tells him to ""branch out"" and make friends with the kids in the neighborhood. He decides to become friends with Fregley, since he could ""mold him into EXACTLY the type of friend [he] need[s]."" Greg tries to get Fregley to do funny things during lunch, and Fregley then becomes popular after the other kids find out that he can ""chew"" food with his belly button.

Greg's mother announces that her extended family will come to town for Easter. Greg then writes about some of his family members, including Meemaw, who organized egg hunts in the backyard. On Easter, the family notices through a photo album that Meemaw has hidden her diamond ring in an egg, and everyone rushes out to find it, although the search is unsuccessful.

Greg decides to join an after-school activity, and with the help of a Magic 8-Ball he found on Easter, he becomes a member of the Yearbook Club. The next day, Greg accidentally drops his Magic 8-Ball, and it breaks. Greg is called to the yearbook office to take yearbook photos of Fregley (Most Popular) and Rowley and Abigail (Cutest Couple). He then resigns from his position.

Greg throws his broken Magic 8-Ball into his grandmother's yard. At school, he learns that Rowley and Abigail have broken up. Greg wonders if he and Rowley should be friends again. He goes back to the Magic 8-Ball, hoping to get ""one last good answer,"" and finds the plastic egg with Meemaw's ring. To avoid breaking up his family, he hides the egg in his mother's closet.

Greg concludes that he has to make big decisions on his own, and reconciles with Rowley. He writes, ""I know Mom's always saying that friends come and go and family is forever, and maybe that's true. [...] I'm sure me and Rowley will get in another fight somewhere down the road and then we'll go through this drama all over again. But for now, we're good.""",Diary of a Wimpy Kid : Hard Luck,Jeff Kinney, , ,Penguin Books,9780141353074,"Edition,2016",236,India,English

The God of Small Things is the debut novel of Indian writer Arundhati Roy. It is a story about the childhood experiences of fraternal twins whose lives are destroyed by the ""Love Laws"" that lay down ""who should be loved, and how. And how much."" The book explores how the small things affect people's behavior and their lives. It won the Booker Prize in 1997.

ndian history and politics shape the plot and meaning of The God of Small Things in a variety of ways. Some of Roy's commentary is on the surface, with jokes and snippets of wisdom about political realities in India. However, the novel also examines the historical roots of these realities and develops profound insights into the ways in which human desperation and desire emerge from the confines of a firmly entrenched caste society.

The story is set in the caste society of India, at a time when members of the Untouchable Paravan or Paryan caste were not permitted to touch members of higher castes or enter their houses. The Untouchables were considered polluted beings. They had the lowliest jobs and lived in subhuman conditions. In India, the caste system was considered a way to organize society. Roy's book shows how terribly cruel such a system can be.

Along with the caste system, readers see an economic class struggle. The Ipes are considered upper class. They are factory owners, the dominating class. Mammachi and Baby Kochamma would not deign to mix with those of a lower class.

However, Roy shows other types of less evident discrimination. For example, there is religious discrimination. It is unacceptable for a Syrian Christian to marry a Hindu and vice versa, and Hindus can only marry a Hindu from the same caste. In more than one passage of the book, the reader feels Rahel's and Estha's discomfort at being half Hindu. Baby Kochamma constantly makes disparaging comments about Hindus. On the other hand, there is discomfort even between Christian denominations as is shown by Pappachi's negative reaction when Baby Kochamma converts to Catholicism.

Chacko suffers more veiled racial discrimination, as it seems his daughter also does. His English wife's parents were shocked and disapproving that their daughter would marry an Indian, no matter how well educated. Sophie, at one point, mentions to her cousins that they are all ""wog,"" while she is ""half-wog.""

The Ipes are very class-conscious and feel a need to maintain their status. Discrimination is a way of protecting their privileged position in society.",The God of Small Things (Man Booker Prize 1997),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143028574,"1st Published,2002",340,India,English

The Partition in history is a record of a point in time when the country was split apart along religious lines. It is an abstract piece of history for most people. While many books have documented the Partition and the violence surrounding it, most have focused on the social and political causes, and analyzed it as a collection of abstract data. Train To Pakistan is one of the books that focuses on the human drama, the real suffering of the people caught in the middle.
Mano Majra is a village that suddenly becomes part of a border between two countries. The population of the village is predominantly Sikh and Muslim. When news of communal riots and killings reach the village, the different communities express their support for each other and swear to defend one another. However, external influences are just waiting around the corner to disturb this idyllic harmony.
A train filled with the massacred bodies of Hindus and Sikhs arrives at Mano Majra. Slowly, passions gets stoked up, especially by the influx of refugees from the newly created Pakistan. They have tales of horror to tell, and the passions of Sikhs and Hindus of the village are stirred up.
Vested interests, including that of the village magistrate’s, stir up the flames. Hindus and Sikhs who just recently swore to stand by their Muslim neighbors now turn against them. Caught in all this are Juggut Singh and Iqbal. Juggut is a criminal, while Iqbal is a western educated intellectual who is on a mission to reform society. The common thread that binds them together is that they are both thrown into jail as suspects in a murder.
Ram Lal, a local moneylender, has been murdered. Ram Lal was a Hindu and this is used by subversive elements to incite violence against Muslims. The police, in a desperate attempt to divert attention, arrest Iqbal and Juggut.

Glimpses Of World History was written by Nehru in 1934, which provides the readers a panoramic sweep of history, comprising 196 letters in total. These letters were written from a number of prisons in British India from 1930 to 1933. The sole objective of these letters was to introduce Nehru’s daughter, Indira, to world history. In his first letter, Nehru tells Indira about his sadness at being unable to send her any material gift from prison. He goes on to tell her that he would give her something he could afford, which was a series of letters, straight from his heart.

Since these letters were written during his time in prison, Nehru didn’t have access to any reference books, but only his personal notes. Through the course of this book, he covers the history of mankind from 6000 BC till the time he wrote this book. He tells the readers about the rise and fall of large civilizations and empires from Rome, Greece, West Asia, and China. He also throws light on several renowned historical figures such as Genghis Khan, Vladimir Lenin, Mohandas K. Gandhi, and Ashoka. One of his chapters talks about Genghis Khan and the Mongol invasion in a way that is against major European views of that time. He mentions that Genghis was, without doubt, history’s greatest military genius and leader, considering Alexander and Caesar petty before Genghis.

He wrote about several cultures in detail, as he wasn’t in favor of the current way history was taught at school. Owing to the fact that history teaching at school revolved only around a particular country, he wrote about world history to his daughter, to help her understand why people did what they did. These letters have been written in an informal manner, packed with contemporary as well as personal experiences.

In The Outsider (1942), his classic existentialist novel, Camus explores the alienation of an individual who refuses to conform to social norms. Meursault, his anti-hero, will not lie. When his mother dies, he refuses to show his emotions simply to satisfy the expectations of others. And when he commits a random act of violence on a sun-drenched beach near Algiers, his lack of remorse compounds his guilt in the eyes of society and the law. Yet he is as much a victim as a criminal.

Albert Camus' portrayal of a man confronting the absurd, and revolting against the injustice of society, depicts the paradox of man's joy in life when faced with the 'tender indifference' of the world.

Sandra Smith's translation, based on close listening to a recording of Camus reading his work aloud on French radio in 1954, sensitively renders the subtleties and dream-like atmosphere of L'?tranger.

Albert Camus (1913-1960), French novelist, essayist and playwright, is one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. His most famous works include The Myth of Sisyphus (1942), The Plague (1947), The Just (1949), The Rebel (1951) and The Fall (1956). He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, and his last novel, The First Man, unfinished at the time of his death, appeared in print for the first time in 1994, and was published in English soon after by Hamish Hamilton.

Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is a 2012 non-fiction book written by Susan Cain. Cain argues that modern Western culture misunderstands and undervalues the traits and capabilities of introverted people, leading to ""a colossal waste of talent, energy, and happiness"".

The book presents a history of how Western culture transformed from a culture of character to a culture of personality in which an ""extrovert ideal"" dominates and introversion is viewed as inferior or even pathological. Adopting scientific definitions of introversion and extroversion as preferences for different levels of stimulation, Quiet outlines the advantages and disadvantages of each temperament, emphasizing the myth of the extrovert ideal that has dominated in the West since the early twentieth century. Asserting that temperament is a core element of human identity, Cain cites research in biology, psychology, neuroscience and evolution to demonstrate that introversion is both common and normal, noting that many of humankind's most creative individuals and distinguished leaders were introverts. Cain urges changes at the workplace, in schools, and in parenting; offers advice to introverts for functioning in an extrovert-dominated culture; and offers advice in communication, work, and relationships between people of differing temperament.",Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can not Stop Talking,Susan Cain, , ,Penguin Books,9780307352156,"1st Edition,2013",348,Abroad,English

Love in the Time of Cholera is a celebration of life over death, love over despair, and health over sickness. It is the story of Florentino Ariza, who was rejected by Fermina Daza in his youth. He maintains a silent vigil of unrequited love for fifty-one years, nine months, and four days, until he meets Fermina again at her husband’s wake and renews his suit. The novel spans a period from the late 1870’s to the early 1930’s, and it is set in a South American community modeled after Cartagena, Colombia, and besieged by civil wars and plagues.

Florentino, an eighteen-year-old apprentice telegraph operator, sees thirteen-year old Fermina and falls madly in love. Fermina’s father finds out and sends his daughter on an extended trip to remove her from temptation. She returns years later, rejects Florentino, and accepts the proposal of a cultured physician and cholera specialist, Dr. Juvenal Urbino. Although Florentino continues to love Fermina throughout the years, he also continues his own social relationships—engaging in 622 long-term liaisons, which he records in a series of notebooks—and becomes president of a riverboat company. Then Florentino learns that eighty-one-year-old Juvenal has died, falling off a ladder trying to capture a condescending, bilingual parrot.

Yet The Origin of Species (1859) is also a humane and inspirational vision of ecological interrelatedness, revealing the complex mutual interdependencies between animal and plant life, climate and physical environment, and - by implication - within the human world. 

Written for the general reader, in a style which combines the rigour of science with the subtlety of literature, The Origin of Species remains one of the founding documents of the modern age.",On the Origin of Species,Charles Darwin, , ,Penguin Books,9780451529060, , ,Abroad,English

Land of Two Rivers: A History of Bengal provides an incisive look into the history of Bengal, one of the most fascinating and influential regions in the Indian subcontinent. Located at the confluence of two major rivers, Ganga and Brahmaputra, Bengal has been the center of trade, learning and the arts for the longest time. In the medieval era, the rise of Muslim dynasties in Bengal brought into being a unique culture which was very different from that of northern India. The British colonization in the 18th century further transformed the social and economic structure of the region. In this book, the author traces the formation of Bengali identity through the Bengal Renaissance, the growth of nationalist politics and partition of Bengal in 1947. This book will make for an engaging and informative read for those interested in the history of Bengal.

The story unfolds on a cold April day in 1984 in Oceania, the totalitarian superpower in post World War II Europe. Winston Smith, employed as a records (no, not vinyl) editor at the Ministry of Truth, drags himself home to Victory Mansions (nothing victorious about them) for lunch. Depressed and oppressed, he starts a journal of his rebellious thoughts against the Party. If discovered, this journal will result in his execution. Now that’s playing with fire. For the sake of added precautions, Winston only writes when safe from the view of the surveying telescreens. And when that shot of industrial grade ""Victory Gin"" kicks in.

At work, Winston becomes curious about ""the brunette"" (a.k.a. Julia), a machine-operator in the Fiction Department. Although at one time he feared that she was a member of the Thought Police, all such paranoia ends when she slips him a note reading ""I love you"" in the corridor one day. The two begin a secret love affair, first meeting up in the countryside, and then in a rented room atop Mr. Charrington’s shop in the prole district. All of these places are away from surveillance – or so they think.

As Winston and Julia fall deeper in love, Winston’s views about their government (the Party) change. There’s something about Ingsoc that doesn’t seem quite right – is it the manipulation? The changing of history? The all-around sketchiness? Winston is drawn to the revolutionary ""Brotherhood"" because, well, they’re revolutionary. Eventually, Winston makes contact with O’Brien, who Winston thinks is a member of the Brotherhood, but who in actuality is a member of the Thought Police. O’Brien arranges for Winston to receive a copy of ""the book,"" a resistance manifesto which supposedly exposes the how and the why for the resistance.

Unfortunately, Winston never finds out the why. Instead, he gets tortured. But before the torturing, he and Julia are apprehended by the Thought Police. Turns out that secret hiding place wasn’t so secret after all. The happy couple is then brought to the Ministry of Love, where criminals and opponents of the Party are tortured, interrogated, and ""reintegrated"" before their release and ultimate execution. O’Brien runs the show as far as Winston’s torture sessions are concerned.

Months later, Winston is sent to Room 101, where a person is faced with his greatest fear. Rats…why did it have to be rats? Musing on the impending rats-chewing-on-his-face scenario, Winston calls out, ""Do it to Julia!"" That’s pretty much what O’Brien was looking for, so Winston gets to go back to being a happy member of the rat race. Released, Winston’s heart is filled with love for the Party. Even when he and Julia meet again by chance, they feel apathetic towards each other. The last man in Europe has been converted and destroyed. Quite the fine point there, George.

There, traditional stereotypes such as “Men have bigger brains” and women are ""naturally weak"" are countered with logic such as ""an elephant also has a bigger and heavier brain"" and “a lion is stronger than a man” and yet neither of them dominates men.[3] In Ladyland crime is eliminated, since men were considered responsible for all of it.

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.)

Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention).

We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.

Yeah, there's going to be trouble.

Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.

On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again.

Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.)

Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

Marquez's novel is very repetitive and nonlinear, so we're going to lay it down for you in a straightforward and chronological order. It's not what Marquez intended, but it sure is easier to understand.

Six months before 'the incident,' Bayardo San Román comes barging into town looking like he's the best thing since sliced bread. No one knows who he is, and the only thing they do know is that he's looking for a wife. Apparently no one in town thinks this is sketchy, so we'll roll with it too.

One day he randomly chooses Angela as his bride-to-be, despite the fact that she has no interest in him at all. His unrequited love is totally in line with his sketchy character, but everyone seems to ignore the sketch-factor because the dude's richer than Bill Gates. Anyway, Angela's lack of love for Bayardo is not the only problem. She has a secret: She's not a virgin.

Angela's impoverished family doesn't care about this fact and they basically force her into marrying Bayardo. After four months, they have the biggest wedding the town has ever seen. Everyone who's anyone (and some people who aren't even anyone) comes to the party. But it all comes crashing down on their wedding night when it's revealed that Angela is not a virgin.

Bayardo takes her back home, where Angela's mom beats her for about two hours. She tells her brothers that Santiago is the guy who deflowered her, and that's when the murder plot begins.

The next day, the town is still in a festive mood because the Bishop is supposed to visit. They even have crazy amounts of roosters prepared for his favorite cock-comb soup. So even though it's Monday, everything is not operating the way it would normally, which is unfortunate for poor Santiago.

In the hours that follow, everything that could go wrong does go wrong. It's like the darkest black comedy you've ever seen. By 6 AM everyone in town knows that the brothers are going to kill Santiago, but no one does anything. Even though the brothers don't want to kill him, no one stops them. What the heck is up with this town?

In the end, Santiago is killed at his own doorstep.

After the murder, the whole town can't stop talking about it. Angela's family leaves town and so does her husband of five hours. There's even a trial, but it doesn't seem that anything comes of it aside from some pretty cool records written in red ink.

Years later, our narrator goes around talking to the residents of the town. He tries to get some kind of truth, but we don't get anything concrete except for one sad truth: Santiago is dead.

Our lives and specifically the market are so full of random aspects and complex structures. Understanding the behaviour of markets and attributing specific reasons to its behaviour is totally impossible and sometimes a useless task. As the title explains, Taleb’s theory explains how all of us get fooled easily by randomness. Taleb goes on to elaborate how we misconstrue luck and skill. Wherever true luck plays a role, we assume it to be the work of individual skill. Most impressive situations in life are only due to luck, claims Taleb. He uses the theory of black swans (rare events) to propound his idea and says that black swans cannot be predicted.

Taleb elucidates his theory through some popular examples using people like the baseball expert Yogi Berra, the philosopher Karl Popper, the ancient wise man Solon, the financier George Soros and the Greek voyager Odysseus. Most of all, journalists and traders fall for the randomness as well. In addition to real-life examples, Taleb also brings in the case of the fictitious hero Nero, who is smart enough to understand the play of randomness in his professional life, but is superstitiously foolish.

Taleb also constructs an invincible, nameless fool who seems to be at the right place at the right time. The fool has a steady string of followers who are ready to do anything for their Guru. But, the fool’s actions cannot be imitated. His success is one obtained by chance.

The most unexpected things will happen for sure. But, we become creatures of routine that we fail to identify it when it happens. Moreover, detecting risks and accepting them is done only by the emotional part of the brain. If we understand probability, then we can perceive the role of luck in everyday situations. The trick lies in recognizing it. Taleb says we must be aware of the trap that luck sets for us.

How do we distinguish a lucky poseur from a far-sighted visionary? How do we read an incident? How do we decide whether it is luck or talent that made the person successful?

Fooled By Randomness: The Hidden Role Of Chance In The Markets And In Life received wide recognition. Fortune named it as one of the smartest books of all time and the Financial Times termed it as the Book of the Year.

Is life worth living? If life does not possess any significance when confronted with the reality of human existence, is suicide our only alternative? In the essay, Camus introduces the readers to his philosophy of the absurd where man’s futile search for meaning, unity and clarity is questioned. The author states that to realize the reason for our existence, we need to break the norms of normalcy and revolt. During the course of the book, Camus outlines numerous approaches to the absurd life. The author compares the absurdity of human life with the situation of Sisyphus, a Greek mythological figure who was condemned to forever repeat a meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain only to see it roll down again.

In a very engaging and interesting manner, the author states that humans should embrace the absurd. By embracing the absurd, it means that we accept all the unreasonable things that the world has to offer. Camus arrives at three consequences from the full acknowledgement of the absurd, revolt, freedom and passion. How then should the absurd man live? What is the purpose of life? Is suicide the answer to all the problems in life? Through a philosophical series of questioning, this book truly depicts life in a unique and refreshing manner. The book is for all those people who are interested in the philosophy of existentialism, this book will truly engage the readers till the last page.

Camus has drawn some very powerful consequences about life and mortality. Knowing the fact that one day all of us are going to die is a great liberator. Therefore traditions accepted as morals, ethics accepted as habits, all cease to be less important when we know that our time on the planet is limited. An oversimplified version of the essay is that man is only a small part of a vast and endless universe and that the most a man can do is to live their life to the fullest at every moment.

This book serves as a follow-up book to the author’s bestselling 1999 book, The Power Of Now, which promoted the idea that in order to achieve lasting happiness, human beings must learn to dissociate their thoughts from their identities. A New Earth: Create A Better Life builds extensively upon the same primary theme, exploring a different perspective this time around.

The first book had an introspective quality and focused on the spiritual needs of the individual. On the other hand, this book turns the spotlight outwards, choosing to highlight the ways in which an individual’s spiritual evolution can be instrumental in shaping humanity’s collective spiritual consciousness.

Divided into ten chapters, the book begins with a chapter on the awakening of human consciousness. The next three chapters focus on the concept of ego, exploring how attachment towards one’s thoughts, memories, and possessions can give rise to an illusory and harmful sense of self.

In the subsequent chapters, the author discusses concepts such as recurring emotional pain, the space of consciousness, and inner and outer purpose. The final chapter presents the three elements that the author considers to be collectively representative of an awakened consciousness.

A New Earth: Create A Better Life was first published in 2005 by Penguin. It went on to receive high worldwide acclaim, its popularity scaling further when it was chosen as a recommended title by Oprah Winfrey’s Book Club in 2008. This edition is a 2009 reprint by Penguin Books.

About Eckhart Tolle

Eckhart Tolle is a German-Canadian author and public speaker.

He has written books such as Guardians Of Being, A New Earth: Awakening To Your Life’s Purpose, The Power Of Now: A Guide To Spiritual Enlightenment, Oneness With All Life: Inspirational Selections from A New Earth, and Stillness Speaks: Whispers of Now.

Distinctly permeated by a highly spiritual quality, Tolle’s writing explores psychology, metaphysics, and other realms of the esoteric.

Tolle was born as Ulrich Leonard Tolle in 1948 in Germany. He had a very turbulent and disturbed childhood. With the consent of his father, he chose to study language, literature, and astronomy at home instead of attending high school.

The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Late Spring and Autumn Period (roughly 5th century BC). The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (""Master Sun"", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to an aspect of warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare[1] and has influenced both Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy and beyond.

This book contained a detailed explanation and analysis of the Chinese military, from weapons and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun Tzu also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Because Sun Tzu has long been considered to be one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training for centuries to come.
Chapter summary
1. Detail assessment and planning: explores the five fundamental factors (the Way, seasons, terrain, leadership, and management) and seven elements that determine the outcomes of military engagements. By thinking, assessing and comparing these points, a commander can calculate his chances of victory. Habitual deviation from these calculations will ensure failure via improper action. The text stresses that war is a very grave matter for the state and must not be commenced without due consideration.
2. Waging war : explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how success requires winning decisive engagements quickly. This section advises that successful military campaigns require limiting the cost of competition and conflict.
3. Strategic attack : defines the source of strength as unity, not size, and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war. In order of importance, these critical factors are: Attack, Strategy, Alliances, Army and Cities.
4. Disposition of the army : explains the importance of defending existing positions until a commander is capable of advancing from those positions in safety. It teaches commanders the importance of recognizing strategic opportunities, and teaches not to create opportunities for the enemy.
5. Forces : explains the use of creativity and timing in building an army's momentum.
6. Weaknesses and strengths : explains how an army's opportunities come from the openings in the environment caused by the relative weakness of the enemy and how to respond to changes in the fluid battlefield over a given area.
7. Military maneuvers : explains the dangers of direct conflict and how to win those confrontations when they are forced upon the commander.
8. Variations and adaptability : focuses on the need for flexibility in an army's responses. It explains how to respond to shifting circumstances successfully.
9. Movement and development of troops : describes the different situations in which an army finds itself as it moves through new enemy territories, and how to respond to these situations. Much of this section focuses on evaluating the intentions of others.
10. Terrain : looks at the three general areas of resistance (distance, dangers and barriers) and the six types of ground positions that arise from them. Each of these six field positions offers certain advantages and disadvantages.
11. The nine battlegrounds : describes the nine common situations (or stages) in a campaign, from scattering to deadly, and the specific focus that a commander will need in order to successfully navigate them.
12. Attacking with fire : explains the general use of weapons and the specific use of the environment as a weapon. This section examines the five targets for attack, the five types of environmental attack and the appropriate responses to such attacks.
13. Intelligence and espionage : focuses on the importance of developing good information sources, and specifies the five types of intelligence sources and how to best manage each of them.",The Art of War,Sun Tzu,John Minford, ,Penguin Books,9780140455526,"1st edition,2008",112,India,English

“Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None” is a novel by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche that was originally published in four parts between 1883 and 1891.

The novel is a philosophical treatise on Nietzsche’s ideals and his idea of the “overman”. Several of the philosopher’s most famous concepts are introduced in the novel. Including the idea that God is dead (meaning that societies old foundations are dead and that the idea of good and evil has changed) and the “eternal recurrence of the same” or the idea that time is an everlasting line and that anything that can happen has already happened and will happen again eventually.


 
Nietzsche uses the protagonist of the fifth century B.C.E. Philosopher, Zarathustra in order to tell the story. Zarathustra comes down from his mountain top cave to preach to the people about the Overman but is soon rebuked. The book is mainly comprised of Zarathustra’s lessons to the people and to himself.

Globalization has been viewed as a perfect solution for the problems of many weak and nascent economies. A globally integrated economy that allowed the free flow of capital across borders was supposed to benefit the countries that opened up their markets.

That idea has not really worked out well in many places. There is an increasing number of voices protesting against globalization policies. This book, Globalization And Its Discontents analyses the reasons for this rising opposition.

The book does not explicitly take an anti globalization stand. It just inquires into the failures of the idea in certain regions of the world. It examines the factors that contributed towards this failure. The author mainly focuses on the policies of international organizations like the IMF and the World Bank. He says that the global organizations employed a one solution fits all policy. They did not take into account the unique problems and needs of each country that they tried to help. They simply worked on the belief that a free market was the cure to all economic ills.

The author takes up the cases of South Asia and Russia to illustrate his points. He says institutions like the IMF encouraged free flow of capital even in regions without a strongly regulated financial sector. This left the field open for speculative short term investors. These investors panicked and pulled out at the slightest signs of an economic crisis. This destabilized the already weak economies of many developing countries, and whole nations went bankrupt.

The loans from IMF imposed strict conditions on the borrowing countries. These included asking the countries to cut their expenditure on public spending like food subsidies. When economies collapsed and many people lost their jobs, they did not even have a social safety net to fall back on. This led to social and political unrest in countries like Indonesia and Russia. So, the institutions that were supposed to help these countries strengthen their economies instead worsened the crisis, says the author. Globalization And Its Discontents says globalization as such is not a bad idea. It brings in global funding into poor economies and opens up new opportunities and new markets.

What is needed, says the author, are reforms in the functioning of institutions like the IMF. He says that there is need for increased transparency and accountability in these organizations.

The Metamorphosis and Other Stories, by Franz Kafka, is part of the Barnes and Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes and Noble Classics:
All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes and Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.


Virtually unknown during his lifetime, Franz Kafka is now one of the world’s most widely read and discussed authors. His nightmarish novels and short stories have come to symbolize modern man’s anxiety and alienation in a bizarre, hostile, and dehumanized world. This vision is most fully realized in Kafka’s masterpiece, “The Metamorphosis,” a story that is both harrowing and amusing, and a landmark of modern literature. 

Bringing together some of Kafka’s finest work, this collection demonstrates the richness and variety of the author’s artistry. “The Judgment,” which Kafka considered to be his decisive breakthrough, and “The Stoker,” which became the first chapter of his novel Amerika, are here included. These two, along with “The Metamorphosis,” form a suite of stories Kafka referred to as “The Sons,” and they collectively present a devastating portrait of the modern family.

Also included are “In the Penal Colony,” a story of a torture machine and its operators and victims, and “A Hunger Artist,” about the absurdity of an artist trying to communicate with a misunderstanding public. Kafka’s lucid, succinct writing chronicles the labyrinthine complexities, the futility-laden horror, and the stifling oppressiveness that permeate his vision of modern life.

Justice has multiple dimensions and cannot be defined as or decided upon in singular terms. It can mean different things to different people in different instances. It is, in simple words, understood as existing and varying on a continuum. This is the central aspect of the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen’s book, The Idea Of Justice.

This remarkable book by the distinguished economist questions the very notion of social justice being a far-fetched ideal or an achievable and practical possibility. The book defines a perfectly just society and also traces the concept of social justice as understood by philosophers and thinkers over ages. People have continued to face differences in opinions regarding what is just and what is not, and the book places special emphasis on the alternative and comparative perspectives on justice.

The author has introduced an approach to justice followed by the demands of justice, materials of justice, forms of reasoning, and public reasoning and democracy. Within the four parts the book has been divided into are chapters covering endlessly thought-provoking topics.

This book, published in 2009, is dedicated to the memory of one of Amartya Sen’s teachers, named John Rawls. Rawls wrote a book titled A Theory Of Justice, from which Sen has picked up arguments and provided a detailed evaluation of these compelling arguments. Sen has discussed the positions of justice and the situation of original position as highlighted by Rawls in his book.

This is a monumental work is a must-read for all who wish to stir their thoughts and re-think, especially in present times when the world is quivering with questions related to global justice and fairness. A masterful text, this book provides an insight into what can make societies more just rather than making it seem like an endeavour towards a mere utopian dream.",The Idea of Justice,Amartya Sen, , ,Penguin Books,9780141037851,"1st Published,2010",468,India,English

He Algebra of Infinite Justice (2001) is a collection of essays written by Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy. The book discusses several perspectives of global and local concerns, among them one being the abuse of Nuclear bomb showoffs.

The book discusses several issues from fields as diverse as the political euphoria in India over its successful nuclear bomb tests, the 'power' politics wherein she discusses the power generating companies of the world manipulating the laws and policies of the many power-deprived nations.

Introduction:

A few weeks after India detonated a thermonuclear device in 1998, Arundhati Roy wrote ‘The End of Imagination’. The essay attracted worldwide attention as the voice of a brilliant Indian writer speaking out with clarity and conscience against nuclear weapons. Over the next three and a half years, she wrote a series of political essays on a diverse range of momentous subjects: from the illusory benefits of big dams, to the downside of corporate globalization and the US Government’s war against terror. First published in 2001, The Algebra of Infinite Justice brings together all of Arundhati Roy’s political writings so far. This revised paperback edition includes two new essays, written in early 2002: ‘Democracy: Who’s She When She’s at Home’, that examines the horrific communal violence in Gujarat, and ‘War Talk: Summer Games with Nuclear Bombs’, about the threat of nuclear war in the Subcontinent.",The Algebra of Infinite Justice (Award-Winning Authors' Books),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143419280,"Edition,2017",252,India,English

Nehru starts his history with how his ancestors had to flee Kashmir, and then goes on to tell about his own life, with a particular emphasis on the parts of his life that had brought him to this point in time.

His entire life history, from even before his father was born, seems to have led him naturally to where he was.

As a child he seems quiet, observing, and thoughtful. As a (very tall) grownup he is still thoughtful. One sees his admiration for humble people, and his aversion to any form of violence very early in the book.",Jawaharlal Nehru : An Autobiography,Jawaharlal Nehru, , ,Penguin Books,9780143031048,"1st Published,2004",655,India,English

White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India is a tale with many levels, featuring Captain James Achilles Kirkpatrick as the protagonist. On one level, the book details the tragic romance between Kirkpatrick and Khair-un-Nissa, a Muslim noblewoman. On a different level, the story sheds light on the social, military, political, and trade aspects of 18th and 19th century India.

Captain Kirkpatrick is an ambitious soldier in the East India Company. When his eyes settle upon the beautiful Khair, the Nizam’s great-niece, the course of his life takes a new direction. Kirkpatrick soon learns that he must overcome many obstacles in order to marry Khair. Firstly, she is locked in purdah and engaged to be married to a nobleman. Secondly, as a Resident, Kirkpatrick is obligated to convert to Islam, which he hopes will make it easier for him to marry Khair. Kirkpatrick also ends up working as a double-agent, while working for the East India Company, he is actually supporting the Hyderabadis.

Apart from this love story, Dalrymple, also presents a side of history which is virtually unexplored by historians. Through memorable characters such as Hindoo Stuart and Sir David Ochterlony, the author draws readers’ attention to the concept of “white Mughals”. These are people of British descent who had adopted Indian customs, traditions, but who were also a source of embarrassment for colonial administrations. After conducting over five years of research, the author portrays a fascinating portrait about social etiquette, sexual and dismissive attitudes, and the growing racist treatment by the ruling British class towards the offspring of mixed race couples.
White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India won the 2003 Scottish Book Of the Year. In 2011, Dalrymple announced that British actor Ralph Fiennes would act and direct the movie-version of book.

Emraan Hashmi is not just a charming face or an unconventional actor. He is not just bold in his character portrayals. Hashmi, or Emmi as his family members call him, is also a father who is level-headed, unfazed and unyielding.

The Kiss of Life is about that time in Hashmi's life when his son needed him the most, the time when all his other experiences paled in comparison to the tennis ball tumour that invaded his son's kidney.

The chapters alternate between the present - the hospital wards, chemo and the shivers - and the past, where Hashmi battles his own doubts of being an actor, the ups and downs in his career, the media branding him as a serial kisser, the typecasting and so on.

Hashmi's book also has extensive research material on cancer. He talks about guidelines, a nutrition plan, hospital procedures and the will power to fight the C monster.",The Kiss of Life (How a Superhero and My Son Defeated Cancer),"Emraan Hashmi,Bilal Siddiqi", , ,Penguin Books,9780143426509,"1st Edition,2016",185,India,English

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.) 
Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention). 
We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.
Yeah, there's going to be trouble. Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.
On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again. 
Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.) 
Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

“The Starry Night” shows Sexton’s identification with another tortured and suicidal artist, Vincent van Gogh. The short, free-verse poem begins with an epigraph from one of van Gogh’s letters to his brother. “That does not keep me from having a terrible need of—shall I say the word—religion,” van Gogh wrote. “Then I go out at night to paint the stars.” Sexton used epigraphs from a variety of works to begin her poems, and the epigraphs are often of major importance, pointing to a main theme of the poem that might otherwise be overlooked. Here she is indicating that she shares not only the mental imbalance, suicidal tendencies, and artistic nature of the Dutch artist but also his unsatisfied desire for the spiritual.

When van Gogh wrote the letter to his brother, he was painting the masterpiece Starry Night on the Rhone, which is described in the poem. The painting captures the night sky in blues and blacks, with a swirl of violent orange representing the moon, and burning yellow-white stars. One would expect a peaceful scene from the title, but this painting is intensely disquieting. The movement seems to be a great rush skyward, the sleeping town beneath the sky unconscious of this spiraling of all nature toward infinity. Sexton sees this painting as a reflection of her own death wish. The dark tree at the edge of the painting is described as “black-haired”—Sexton was a brunette—and it “slips/ up like a drowned woman into the hot sky.” To make her meaning clearer, she continues, “This is how/ I want to die.”

The poem interprets the painting as presenting a nature that is animate and hostile. Nevertheless, the picture attracts the speaker, because nature’s brute force promises death, release from the burden of self. Sexton sees the central moon image in the painting as a great dragon that will suck her up into its being. She desires, she says, “to split/ from my life with no flag,/ no belly,/ no cry”—to merge silently and painlessly with the infinite. The images may suggest not a rediscovery of religion but a terrifying substitute for it. Part of the appeal of this poem lies in the vivid interpretation of the painting and in the kinship the reader sees between Sexton and van Gogh.",Starry Nights,Shobhaa De, , ,Penguin Books,9780143421313,"1st Edition,2013",315,India,English

Insiders know that besides her commitment to work and the frantic pace of her life, Shobhaa Dé's first priority in life has always been her family. Here she writes poignantly of her early years, and of her relationship with her parents and siblings, her husband and her children. Shobha De's high voltage career 'happened' in unexpected ways, starting with her unplanned entry as a teenager into the glamorous world of modeling, and moving on to her high-profile years as a magazine editor. In these avatars she keenly observed and astutely chronicled the new India— brash, affluent and ambitious. High-society hi-jinks, movie star follies, celebrity neurosis— none of these escaped her unsparing eye. And now she tells it all, just as it was, just as she saw it. In her inimitably forthright fashion, she writes of the choices she made, the decisions she took and the influences that shaped her.

One Hundred Years Of Solitude, a literary masterpiece by the Nobel Laureate, is a metaphoric mirror to Colombian history. The contemplative novel drapes the tale of the rise and fall of Macondo and magically captures the life and times of the Buendia family over seven generations.  

Summary Of The Book:
Set in a fictional town called Macondo in Northern Colombia, One Hundred Years Of Solitude begins with Jose Arcadio Buendia leaving his hometown with his wife Ursula, in search of a better life. One night during their journey, they happen to camp at a riverside where Jose dreams about a spectacular city and decides to establish one on the same riverbank. Thus, he builds Macondo and slowly shapes it into how he wants a city to be. Macondo then begins to miraculously attract unusual people and extraordinary events that make for a gripping plot. The adventurous Buendias find themselves in the middle of some of the most historically potent 
circumstances in Colombia. As the lineage stands in the face of the glory and downfall of a civilization, Marquez's lyrical magic manifests the delicate nuances of love and war, youth and senility, and passion and lust. And finally, what had started as an innocent dream of Jose, Ursula and 19 other families gradually break down and fall prey to lawless anarchy. 

One Hundred Years Of Solitude also chronicles the political and economic developments of the 19th century Colombia, such as corruption and capitalism with a touch of fiction. In a deeply touching and thought provoking non-linear narrative, Marquez paints a hundred years of history on the canvas of time. He uses his prerogative of having witnessed the wave of the Colombian revolution to graphically depict its lasting influence. He arrests in prose, the magical realism surrounding life, death, peace and the truth of mankind. 

Written originally in Spanish, One Hundred Years Of Solitude was published first in 1967. It has since been translated into 37 languages and sold more than 20 million copies worldover. A recipient of global acclaim and numerous awards, the book won Marquez his Nobel Prize in 1982.

Can they lie so far out of the ordinary?

In his provocative and inspiring new book, Malcolm Gladwell looks at everyone from rock stars to professional athletes, software billionaires to scientific geniuses, to show that the story of success is far more surprising, than we could ever have imagined.  He reveals that it's as much about where we're from and what we do, as who we are and that no one, not even a genius, ever makes it alone.

The book starts with Greg writing about how his mother is always saying that ""friends will come and go but family is forever."" Greg doesn't believe that, since his friend, Rowley, now has a girlfriend named Abigail, continuing from the events of the last book. Ever since then, Rowley has been acting different, such as refusing to hang out with Greg and agreeing with everything Abigail says.

Greg has been getting bored without Rowley, so his mother tells him to ""branch out"" and make friends with the kids in the neighborhood. He decides to become friends with Fregley, since he could ""mold him into EXACTLY the type of friend [he] need[s]."" Greg tries to get Fregley to do funny things during lunch, and Fregley then becomes popular after the other kids find out that he can ""chew"" food with his belly button.

Greg's mother announces that her extended family will come to town for Easter. Greg then writes about some of his family members, including Meemaw, who organized egg hunts in the backyard. On Easter, the family notices through a photo album that Meemaw has hidden her diamond ring in an egg, and everyone rushes out to find it, although the search is unsuccessful.

Greg decides to join an after-school activity, and with the help of a Magic 8-Ball he found on Easter, he becomes a member of the Yearbook Club. The next day, Greg accidentally drops his Magic 8-Ball, and it breaks. Greg is called to the yearbook office to take yearbook photos of Fregley (Most Popular) and Rowley and Abigail (Cutest Couple). He then resigns from his position.

Greg throws his broken Magic 8-Ball into his grandmother's yard. At school, he learns that Rowley and Abigail have broken up. Greg wonders if he and Rowley should be friends again. He goes back to the Magic 8-Ball, hoping to get ""one last good answer,"" and finds the plastic egg with Meemaw's ring. To avoid breaking up his family, he hides the egg in his mother's closet.

Greg concludes that he has to make big decisions on his own, and reconciles with Rowley. He writes, ""I know Mom's always saying that friends come and go and family is forever, and maybe that's true. [...] I'm sure me and Rowley will get in another fight somewhere down the road and then we'll go through this drama all over again. But for now, we're good.""",Diary of a Wimpy Kid : Hard Luck,Jeff Kinney, , ,Penguin Books,9780141353074,"Edition,2016",236,India,English

The God of Small Things is the debut novel of Indian writer Arundhati Roy. It is a story about the childhood experiences of fraternal twins whose lives are destroyed by the ""Love Laws"" that lay down ""who should be loved, and how. And how much."" The book explores how the small things affect people's behavior and their lives. It won the Booker Prize in 1997.

ndian history and politics shape the plot and meaning of The God of Small Things in a variety of ways. Some of Roy's commentary is on the surface, with jokes and snippets of wisdom about political realities in India. However, the novel also examines the historical roots of these realities and develops profound insights into the ways in which human desperation and desire emerge from the confines of a firmly entrenched caste society.

The story is set in the caste society of India, at a time when members of the Untouchable Paravan or Paryan caste were not permitted to touch members of higher castes or enter their houses. The Untouchables were considered polluted beings. They had the lowliest jobs and lived in subhuman conditions. In India, the caste system was considered a way to organize society. Roy's book shows how terribly cruel such a system can be.

Along with the caste system, readers see an economic class struggle. The Ipes are considered upper class. They are factory owners, the dominating class. Mammachi and Baby Kochamma would not deign to mix with those of a lower class.

However, Roy shows other types of less evident discrimination. For example, there is religious discrimination. It is unacceptable for a Syrian Christian to marry a Hindu and vice versa, and Hindus can only marry a Hindu from the same caste. In more than one passage of the book, the reader feels Rahel's and Estha's discomfort at being half Hindu. Baby Kochamma constantly makes disparaging comments about Hindus. On the other hand, there is discomfort even between Christian denominations as is shown by Pappachi's negative reaction when Baby Kochamma converts to Catholicism.

Chacko suffers more veiled racial discrimination, as it seems his daughter also does. His English wife's parents were shocked and disapproving that their daughter would marry an Indian, no matter how well educated. Sophie, at one point, mentions to her cousins that they are all ""wog,"" while she is ""half-wog.""

The Ipes are very class-conscious and feel a need to maintain their status. Discrimination is a way of protecting their privileged position in society.",The God of Small Things (Man Booker Prize 1997),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143028574,"1st Published,2002",340,India,English

The Partition in history is a record of a point in time when the country was split apart along religious lines. It is an abstract piece of history for most people. While many books have documented the Partition and the violence surrounding it, most have focused on the social and political causes, and analyzed it as a collection of abstract data. Train To Pakistan is one of the books that focuses on the human drama, the real suffering of the people caught in the middle.
Mano Majra is a village that suddenly becomes part of a border between two countries. The population of the village is predominantly Sikh and Muslim. When news of communal riots and killings reach the village, the different communities express their support for each other and swear to defend one another. However, external influences are just waiting around the corner to disturb this idyllic harmony.
A train filled with the massacred bodies of Hindus and Sikhs arrives at Mano Majra. Slowly, passions gets stoked up, especially by the influx of refugees from the newly created Pakistan. They have tales of horror to tell, and the passions of Sikhs and Hindus of the village are stirred up.
Vested interests, including that of the village magistrate’s, stir up the flames. Hindus and Sikhs who just recently swore to stand by their Muslim neighbors now turn against them. Caught in all this are Juggut Singh and Iqbal. Juggut is a criminal, while Iqbal is a western educated intellectual who is on a mission to reform society. The common thread that binds them together is that they are both thrown into jail as suspects in a murder.
Ram Lal, a local moneylender, has been murdered. Ram Lal was a Hindu and this is used by subversive elements to incite violence against Muslims. The police, in a desperate attempt to divert attention, arrest Iqbal and Juggut.
Meanwhile, as the violence escalates, a train arrives to take the Muslim population of the village en masse to Pakistan.

Glimpses Of World History was written by Nehru in 1934, which provides the readers a panoramic sweep of history, comprising 196 letters in total. These letters were written from a number of prisons in British India from 1930 to 1933. The sole objective of these letters was to introduce Nehru’s daughter, Indira, to world history. In his first letter, Nehru tells Indira about his sadness at being unable to send her any material gift from prison. He goes on to tell her that he would give her something he could afford, which was a series of letters, straight from his heart.

Since these letters were written during his time in prison, Nehru didn’t have access to any reference books, but only his personal notes. Through the course of this book, he covers the history of mankind from 6000 BC till the time he wrote this book. He tells the readers about the rise and fall of large civilizations and empires from Rome, Greece, West Asia, and China. He also throws light on several renowned historical figures such as Genghis Khan, Vladimir Lenin, Mohandas K. Gandhi, and Ashoka. One of his chapters talks about Genghis Khan and the Mongol invasion in a way that is against major European views of that time. He mentions that Genghis was, without doubt, history’s greatest military genius and leader, considering Alexander and Caesar petty before Genghis.

He wrote about several cultures in detail, as he wasn’t in favor of the current way history was taught at school. Owing to the fact that history teaching at school revolved only around a particular country, he wrote about world history to his daughter, to help her understand why people did what they did. These letters have been written in an informal manner, packed with contemporary as well as personal experiences.

In The Outsider (1942), his classic existentialist novel, Camus explores the alienation of an individual who refuses to conform to social norms. Meursault, his anti-hero, will not lie. When his mother dies, he refuses to show his emotions simply to satisfy the expectations of others. And when he commits a random act of violence on a sun-drenched beach near Algiers, his lack of remorse compounds his guilt in the eyes of society and the law. Yet he is as much a victim as a criminal.

Albert Camus' portrayal of a man confronting the absurd, and revolting against the injustice of society, depicts the paradox of man's joy in life when faced with the 'tender indifference' of the world.

Sandra Smith's translation, based on close listening to a recording of Camus reading his work aloud on French radio in 1954, sensitively renders the subtleties and dream-like atmosphere of L'?tranger.

Albert Camus (1913-1960), French novelist, essayist and playwright, is one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. His most famous works include The Myth of Sisyphus (1942), The Plague (1947), The Just (1949), The Rebel (1951) and The Fall (1956). He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, and his last novel, The First Man, unfinished at the time of his death, appeared in print for the first time in 1994, and was published in English soon after by Hamish Hamilton.

Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is a 2012 non-fiction book written by Susan Cain. Cain argues that modern Western culture misunderstands and undervalues the traits and capabilities of introverted people, leading to ""a colossal waste of talent, energy, and happiness"".

The book presents a history of how Western culture transformed from a culture of character to a culture of personality in which an ""extrovert ideal"" dominates and introversion is viewed as inferior or even pathological. Adopting scientific definitions of introversion and extroversion as preferences for different levels of stimulation, Quiet outlines the advantages and disadvantages of each temperament, emphasizing the myth of the extrovert ideal that has dominated in the West since the early twentieth century. Asserting that temperament is a core element of human identity, Cain cites research in biology, psychology, neuroscience and evolution to demonstrate that introversion is both common and normal, noting that many of humankind's most creative individuals and distinguished leaders were introverts. Cain urges changes at the workplace, in schools, and in parenting; offers advice to introverts for functioning in an extrovert-dominated culture; and offers advice in communication, work, and relationships between people of differing temperament.",Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can not Stop Talking,Susan Cain, , ,Penguin Books,9780307352156,"1st Edition,2013",348,Abroad,English

Love in the Time of Cholera is a celebration of life over death, love over despair, and health over sickness. It is the story of Florentino Ariza, who was rejected by Fermina Daza in his youth. He maintains a silent vigil of unrequited love for fifty-one years, nine months, and four days, until he meets Fermina again at her husband’s wake and renews his suit. The novel spans a period from the late 1870’s to the early 1930’s, and it is set in a South American community modeled after Cartagena, Colombia, and besieged by civil wars and plagues.

Florentino, an eighteen-year-old apprentice telegraph operator, sees thirteen-year old Fermina and falls madly in love. Fermina’s father finds out and sends his daughter on an extended trip to remove her from temptation. She returns years later, rejects Florentino, and accepts the proposal of a cultured physician and cholera specialist, Dr. Juvenal Urbino. Although Florentino continues to love Fermina throughout the years, he also continues his own social relationships—engaging in 622 long-term liaisons, which he records in a series of notebooks—and becomes president of a riverboat company.

The story unfolds on a cold April day in 1984 in Oceania, the totalitarian superpower in post World War II Europe. Winston Smith, employed as a records (no, not vinyl) editor at the Ministry of Truth, drags himself home to Victory Mansions (nothing victorious about them) for lunch. Depressed and oppressed, he starts a journal of his rebellious thoughts against the Party. If discovered, this journal will result in his execution. Now that’s playing with fire. For the sake of added precautions, Winston only writes when safe from the view of the surveying telescreens. And when that shot of industrial grade ""Victory Gin"" kicks in.

At work, Winston becomes curious about ""the brunette"" (a.k.a. Julia), a machine-operator in the Fiction Department. Although at one time he feared that she was a member of the Thought Police, all such paranoia ends when she slips him a note reading ""I love you"" in the corridor one day. The two begin a secret love affair, first meeting up in the countryside, and then in a rented room atop Mr. Charrington’s shop in the prole district. All of these places are away from surveillance – or so they think.

As Winston and Julia fall deeper in love, Winston’s views about their government (the Party) change. There’s something about Ingsoc that doesn’t seem quite right – is it the manipulation? The changing of history? The all-around sketchiness? Winston is drawn to the revolutionary ""Brotherhood"" because, well, they’re revolutionary. Eventually, Winston makes contact with O’Brien, who Winston thinks is a member of the Brotherhood, but who in actuality is a member of the Thought Police. O’Brien arranges for Winston to receive a copy of ""the book,"" a resistance manifesto which supposedly exposes the how and the why for the resistance.

Unfortunately, Winston never finds out the why. Instead, he gets tortured. But before the torturing, he and Julia are apprehended by the Thought Police. Turns out that secret hiding place wasn’t so secret after all. The happy couple is then brought to the Ministry of Love, where criminals and opponents of the Party are tortured, interrogated, and ""reintegrated"" before their release and ultimate execution. O’Brien runs the show as far as Winston’s torture sessions are concerned.

Months later, Winston is sent to Room 101, where a person is faced with his greatest fear. Rats…why did it have to be rats? Musing on the impending rats-chewing-on-his-face scenario, Winston calls out, ""Do it to Julia!"" That’s pretty much what O’Brien was looking for, so Winston gets to go back to being a happy member of the rat race. Released, Winston’s heart is filled with love for the Party. Even when he and Julia meet again by chance, they feel apathetic towards each other. The last man in Europe has been converted and destroyed. Quite the fine point there, George.

It depicts a feminist utopia (called Ladyland) in which women run everything and men are secluded, in a mirror-image of the traditional practice of purdah. The women are aided by science fiction-esque ""electrical"" technology which enables laborless farming and flying cars; the women scientists have discovered how to trap solar power and control the weather. This results in ""a sort of gender-based Planet of the Apes where the roles are reversed and the men are locked away in a technologically advanced future.

There, traditional stereotypes such as “Men have bigger brains” and women are ""naturally weak"" are countered with logic such as ""an elephant also has a bigger and heavier brain"" and “a lion is stronger than a man” and yet neither of them dominates men.[3] In Ladyland crime is eliminated, since men were considered responsible for all of it. The workday is only two hours long, since men used to waste six hours of each day in smoking. The religion is one of love and truth.

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.)

Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention).

We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.

Yeah, there's going to be trouble.

Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.

On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again.

Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.)

Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

Marquez's novel is very repetitive and nonlinear, so we're going to lay it down for you in a straightforward and chronological order. It's not what Marquez intended, but it sure is easier to understand.

Six months before 'the incident,' Bayardo San Román comes barging into town looking like he's the best thing since sliced bread. No one knows who he is, and the only thing they do know is that he's looking for a wife. Apparently no one in town thinks this is sketchy, so we'll roll with it too.

One day he randomly chooses Angela as his bride-to-be, despite the fact that she has no interest in him at all. His unrequited love is totally in line with his sketchy character, but everyone seems to ignore the sketch-factor because the dude's richer than Bill Gates. Anyway, Angela's lack of love for Bayardo is not the only problem. She has a secret: She's not a virgin.

Angela's impoverished family doesn't care about this fact and they basically force her into marrying Bayardo. After four months, they have the biggest wedding the town has ever seen. Everyone who's anyone (and some people who aren't even anyone) comes to the party. But it all comes crashing down on their wedding night when it's revealed that Angela is not a virgin.

Bayardo takes her back home, where Angela's mom beats her for about two hours. She tells her brothers that Santiago is the guy who deflowered her, and that's when the murder plot begins.

The next day, the town is still in a festive mood because the Bishop is supposed to visit. They even have crazy amounts of roosters prepared for his favorite cock-comb soup. So even though it's Monday, everything is not operating the way it would normally, which is unfortunate for poor Santiago.

In the hours that follow, everything that could go wrong does go wrong. It's like the darkest black comedy you've ever seen. By 6 AM everyone in town knows that the brothers are going to kill Santiago, but no one does anything. Even though the brothers don't want to kill him, no one stops them. What the heck is up with this town?

In the end, Santiago is killed at his own doorstep.

After the murder, the whole town can't stop talking about it. Angela's family leaves town and so does her husband of five hours. There's even a trial, but it doesn't seem that anything comes of it aside from some pretty cool records written in red ink.

Years later, our narrator goes around talking to the residents of the town. He tries to get some kind of truth, but we don't get anything concrete except for one sad truth: Santiago is dead.

Our lives and specifically the market are so full of random aspects and complex structures. Understanding the behaviour of markets and attributing specific reasons to its behaviour is totally impossible and sometimes a useless task. As the title explains, Taleb’s theory explains how all of us get fooled easily by randomness. Taleb goes on to elaborate how we misconstrue luck and skill. Wherever true luck plays a role, we assume it to be the work of individual skill. Most impressive situations in life are only due to luck, claims Taleb. He uses the theory of black swans (rare events) to propound his idea and says that black swans cannot be predicted.

Taleb elucidates his theory through some popular examples using people like the baseball expert Yogi Berra, the philosopher Karl Popper, the ancient wise man Solon, the financier George Soros and the Greek voyager Odysseus. Most of all, journalists and traders fall for the randomness as well. In addition to real-life examples, Taleb also brings in the case of the fictitious hero Nero, who is smart enough to understand the play of randomness in his professional life, but is superstitiously foolish.

Taleb also constructs an invincible, nameless fool who seems to be at the right place at the right time. The fool has a steady string of followers who are ready to do anything for their Guru. But, the fool’s actions cannot be imitated. His success is one obtained by chance.

The most unexpected things will happen for sure. But, we become creatures of routine that we fail to identify it when it happens. Moreover, detecting risks and accepting them is done only by the emotional part of the brain. If we understand probability, then we can perceive the role of luck in everyday situations. The trick lies in recognizing it. Taleb says we must be aware of the trap that luck sets for us.

How do we distinguish a lucky poseur from a far-sighted visionary? How do we read an incident? How do we decide whether it is luck or talent that made the person successful?

Fooled By Randomness: The Hidden Role Of Chance In The Markets And In Life received wide recognition. Fortune named it as one of the smartest books of all time and the Financial Times termed it as the Book of the Year.

Is life worth living? If life does not possess any significance when confronted with the reality of human existence, is suicide our only alternative? In the essay, Camus introduces the readers to his philosophy of the absurd where man’s futile search for meaning, unity and clarity is questioned. The author states that to realize the reason for our existence, we need to break the norms of normalcy and revolt. During the course of the book, Camus outlines numerous approaches to the absurd life. The author compares the absurdity of human life with the situation of Sisyphus, a Greek mythological figure who was condemned to forever repeat a meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain only to see it roll down again.

In a very engaging and interesting manner, the author states that humans should embrace the absurd. By embracing the absurd, it means that we accept all the unreasonable things that the world has to offer. Camus arrives at three consequences from the full acknowledgement of the absurd, revolt, freedom and passion. How then should the absurd man live? What is the purpose of life? Is suicide the answer to all the problems in life? Through a philosophical series of questioning, this book truly depicts life in a unique and refreshing manner. The book is for all those people who are interested in the philosophy of existentialism, this book will truly engage the readers till the last page.

Camus has drawn some very powerful consequences about life and mortality. Knowing the fact that one day all of us are going to die is a great liberator. Therefore traditions accepted as morals, ethics accepted as habits, all cease to be less important when we know that our time on the planet is limited. An oversimplified version of the essay is that man is only a small part of a vast and endless universe and that the most a man can do is to live their life to the fullest at every moment.

The story unfolds on a cold April day in 1984 in Oceania, the totalitarian superpower in post World War II Europe. Winston Smith, employed as a records (no, not vinyl) editor at the Ministry of Truth, drags himself home to Victory Mansions (nothing victorious about them) for lunch. Depressed and oppressed, he starts a journal of his rebellious thoughts against the Party. If discovered, this journal will result in his execution. Now that’s playing with fire. For the sake of added precautions, Winston only writes when safe from the view of the surveying telescreens. And when that shot of industrial grade ""Victory Gin"" kicks in.
At work, Winston becomes curious about ""the brunette"" (a.k.a. Julia), a machine-operator in the Fiction Department. Although at one time he feared that she was a member of the Thought Police, all such paranoia ends when she slips him a note reading ""I love you"" in the corridor one day. The two begin a secret love affair, first meeting up in the countryside, and then in a rented room atop Mr. Charrington’s shop in the prole district. All of these places are away from surveillance – or so they think. 
As Winston and Julia fall deeper in love, Winston’s views about their government (the Party) change. There’s something about Ingsoc that doesn’t seem quite right – is it the manipulation? The changing of history? The all-around sketchiness? Winston is drawn to the revolutionary ""Brotherhood"" because, well, they’re revolutionary. Eventually, Winston makes contact with O’Brien, who Winston thinks is a member of the Brotherhood, but who in actuality is a member of the Thought Police. O’Brien arranges for Winston to receive a copy of ""the book,"" a resistance manifesto which supposedly exposes the how and the why for the resistance. 
Unfortunately, Winston never finds out the why. Instead, he gets tortured. But before the torturing, he and Julia are apprehended by the Thought Police. Turns out that secret hiding place wasn’t so secret after all. The happy couple is then brought to the Ministry of Love, where criminals and opponents of the Party are tortured, interrogated, and ""reintegrated"" before their release and ultimate execution.

This book serves as a follow-up book to the author’s bestselling 1999 book, The Power Of Now, which promoted the idea that in order to achieve lasting happiness, human beings must learn to dissociate their thoughts from their identities. A New Earth: Create A Better Life builds extensively upon the same primary theme, exploring a different perspective this time around.

The first book had an introspective quality and focused on the spiritual needs of the individual. On the other hand, this book turns the spotlight outwards, choosing to highlight the ways in which an individual’s spiritual evolution can be instrumental in shaping humanity’s collective spiritual consciousness.

Divided into ten chapters, the book begins with a chapter on the awakening of human consciousness. The next three chapters focus on the concept of ego, exploring how attachment towards one’s thoughts, memories, and possessions can give rise to an illusory and harmful sense of self.

In the subsequent chapters, the author discusses concepts such as recurring emotional pain, the space of consciousness, and inner and outer purpose. The final chapter presents the three elements that the author considers to be collectively representative of an awakened consciousness.

A New Earth: Create A Better Life was first published in 2005 by Penguin. It went on to receive high worldwide acclaim, its popularity scaling further when it was chosen as a recommended title by Oprah Winfrey’s Book Club in 2008. This edition is a 2009 reprint by Penguin Books.

The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Late Spring and Autumn Period (roughly 5th century BC). The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (""Master Sun"", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to an aspect of warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare[1] and has influenced both Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy and beyond.

This book contained a detailed explanation and analysis of the Chinese military, from weapons and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun Tzu also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Because Sun Tzu has long been considered to be one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training for centuries to come.
Chapter summary
1. Detail assessment and planning: explores the five fundamental factors (the Way, seasons, terrain, leadership, and management) and seven elements that determine the outcomes of military engagements. By thinking, assessing and comparing these points, a commander can calculate his chances of victory. Habitual deviation from these calculations will ensure failure via improper action. The text stresses that war is a very grave matter for the state and must not be commenced without due consideration.
2. Waging war : explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how success requires winning decisive engagements quickly. This section advises that successful military campaigns require limiting the cost of competition and conflict.
3. Strategic attack : defines the source of strength as unity, not size, and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war. In order of importance, these critical factors are: Attack, Strategy, Alliances, Army and Cities.
4. Disposition of the army : explains the importance of defending existing positions until a commander is capable of advancing from those positions in safety. It teaches commanders the importance of recognizing strategic opportunities, and teaches not to create opportunities for the enemy.
5. Forces : explains the use of creativity and timing in building an army's momentum.
6. Weaknesses and strengths : explains how an army's opportunities come from the openings in the environment caused by the relative weakness of the enemy and how to respond to changes in the fluid battlefield over a given area.
7. Military maneuvers : explains the dangers of direct conflict and how to win those confrontations when they are forced upon the commander.
8. Variations and adaptability : focuses on the need for flexibility in an army's responses. It explains how to respond to shifting circumstances successfully.
9. Movement and development of troops : describes the different situations in which an army finds itself as it moves through new enemy territories, and how to respond to these situations. Much of this section focuses on evaluating the intentions of others.
10. Terrain : looks at the three general areas of resistance (distance, dangers and barriers) and the six types of ground positions that arise from them. Each of these six field positions offers certain advantages and disadvantages.
11. The nine battlegrounds : describes the nine common situations (or stages) in a campaign, from scattering to deadly, and the specific focus that a commander will need in order to successfully navigate them.
12. Attacking with fire : explains the general use of weapons and the specific use of the environment as a weapon. This section examines the five targets for attack, the five types of environmental attack and the appropriate responses to such attacks.
13. Intelligence and espionage : focuses on the importance of developing good information sources, and specifies the five types of intelligence sources and how to best manage each of them.",The Art of War,Sun Tzu,John Minford, ,Penguin Books,9780140455526,"1st edition,2008",112,India,English

“Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None” is a novel by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche that was originally published in four parts between 1883 and 1891.

The novel is a philosophical treatise on Nietzsche’s ideals and his idea of the “overman”. Several of the philosopher’s most famous concepts are introduced in the novel. Including the idea that God is dead (meaning that societies old foundations are dead and that the idea of good and evil has changed) and the “eternal recurrence of the same” or the idea that time is an everlasting line and that anything that can happen has already happened and will happen again eventually.


 
Nietzsche uses the protagonist of the fifth century B.C.E. Philosopher, Zarathustra in order to tell the story. Zarathustra comes down from his mountain top cave to preach to the people about the Overman but is soon rebuked. The book is mainly comprised of Zarathustra’s lessons to the people and to himself. In the end, he battles his final sin: pity and sees a sign that the overman is coming.",Thus Spoke Zarathustra (Penguin Classics),Friedrich Nietzsche, , ,Penguin Books,9789380005553,"second edition,2014",416,India,English
Globalization and its Discontent,জোসেফ ই. স্টিগলিটজ্,TK. 718,"",https://rokomari.com//book/84828/globalization-and-its-discontent,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/d5cbebd6b_84828.jpg,"Summary Of The Book

Globalization has been viewed as a perfect solution for the problems of many weak and nascent economies. A globally integrated economy that allowed the free flow of capital across borders was supposed to benefit the countries that opened up their markets.

That idea has not really worked out well in many places. There is an increasing number of voices protesting against globalization policies. This book, Globalization And Its Discontents analyses the reasons for this rising opposition.

The book does not explicitly take an anti globalization stand. It just inquires into the failures of the idea in certain regions of the world. It examines the factors that contributed towards this failure. The author mainly focuses on the policies of international organizations like the IMF and the World Bank. He says that the global organizations employed a one solution fits all policy. They did not take into account the unique problems and needs of each country that they tried to help. They simply worked on the belief that a free market was the cure to all economic ills.

The author takes up the cases of South Asia and Russia to illustrate his points. He says institutions like the IMF encouraged free flow of capital even in regions without a strongly regulated financial sector. This left the field open for speculative short term investors. These investors panicked and pulled out at the slightest signs of an economic crisis. This destabilized the already weak economies of many developing countries, and whole nations went bankrupt.

The loans from IMF imposed strict conditions on the borrowing countries. These included asking the countries to cut their expenditure on public spending like food subsidies. When economies collapsed and many people lost their jobs, they did not even have a social safety net to fall back on. This led to social and political unrest in countries like Indonesia and Russia. So, the institutions that were supposed to help these countries strengthen their economies instead worsened the crisis, says the author. Globalization And Its Discontents says globalization as such is not a bad idea. It brings in global funding into poor economies and opens up new opportunities and new markets.

What is needed, says the author, are reforms in the functioning of institutions like the IMF. He says that there is need for increased transparency and accountability in these organizations.

The Metamorphosis and Other Stories, by Franz Kafka, is part of the Barnes and Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes and Noble Classics:
All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes and Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.


Virtually unknown during his lifetime, Franz Kafka is now one of the world’s most widely read and discussed authors. His nightmarish novels and short stories have come to symbolize modern man’s anxiety and alienation in a bizarre, hostile, and dehumanized world. This vision is most fully realized in Kafka’s masterpiece, “The Metamorphosis,” a story that is both harrowing and amusing, and a landmark of modern literature. 

Bringing together some of Kafka’s finest work, this collection demonstrates the richness and variety of the author’s artistry. “The Judgment,” which Kafka considered to be his decisive breakthrough, and “The Stoker,” which became the first chapter of his novel Amerika, are here included. These two, along with “The Metamorphosis,” form a suite of stories Kafka referred to as “The Sons,” and they collectively present a devastating portrait of the modern family.

Also included are “In the Penal Colony,” a story of a torture machine and its operators and victims, and “A Hunger Artist,” about the absurdity of an artist trying to communicate with a misunderstanding public. Kafka’s lucid, succinct writing chronicles the labyrinthine complexities, the futility-laden horror, and the stifling oppressiveness that permeate his vision of modern life.

Justice has multiple dimensions and cannot be defined as or decided upon in singular terms. It can mean different things to different people in different instances. It is, in simple words, understood as existing and varying on a continuum. This is the central aspect of the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen’s book, The Idea Of Justice.

This remarkable book by the distinguished economist questions the very notion of social justice being a far-fetched ideal or an achievable and practical possibility. The book defines a perfectly just society and also traces the concept of social justice as understood by philosophers and thinkers over ages. People have continued to face differences in opinions regarding what is just and what is not, and the book places special emphasis on the alternative and comparative perspectives on justice.

The author has introduced an approach to justice followed by the demands of justice, materials of justice, forms of reasoning, and public reasoning and democracy. Within the four parts the book has been divided into are chapters covering endlessly thought-provoking topics.

This book, published in 2009, is dedicated to the memory of one of Amartya Sen’s teachers, named John Rawls. Rawls wrote a book titled A Theory Of Justice, from which Sen has picked up arguments and provided a detailed evaluation of these compelling arguments. Sen has discussed the positions of justice and the situation of original position as highlighted by Rawls in his book.

This is a monumental work is a must-read for all who wish to stir their thoughts and re-think, especially in present times when the world is quivering with questions related to global justice and fairness. A masterful text, this book provides an insight into what can make societies more just rather than making it seem like an endeavour towards a mere utopian dream.",The Idea of Justice,Amartya Sen, , ,Penguin Books,9780141037851,"1st Published,2010",468,India,English

The first playwright to depict suffering without reference to the gods, Euripides (484-407 BC) made his characters speak in human terms and face the consequences of their actions. In Medea, a woman rejected by her lover takes hideous revenge by murdering the children they both love, and Hecabe depicts the former queen of Troy, driven mad by the prospect of her daughter's sacrifice to Achilles. Electra portrays a young woman planning to avenge the brutal death of her father at the hands of her mother, while in Heracles the hero seeks vengeance against the evil king who has caused bloodshed in his family.

He Algebra of Infinite Justice (2001) is a collection of essays written by Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy. The book discusses several perspectives of global and local concerns, among them one being the abuse of Nuclear bomb showoffs.

The book discusses several issues from fields as diverse as the political euphoria in India over its successful nuclear bomb tests, the 'power' politics wherein she discusses the power generating companies of the world manipulating the laws and policies of the many power-deprived nations.

Introduction:

A few weeks after India detonated a thermonuclear device in 1998, Arundhati Roy wrote ‘The End of Imagination’. The essay attracted worldwide attention as the voice of a brilliant Indian writer speaking out with clarity and conscience against nuclear weapons. Over the next three and a half years, she wrote a series of political essays on a diverse range of momentous subjects: from the illusory benefits of big dams, to the downside of corporate globalization and the US Government’s war against terror. First published in 2001, The Algebra of Infinite Justice brings together all of Arundhati Roy’s political writings so far. This revised paperback edition includes two new essays, written in early 2002: ‘Democracy: Who’s She When She’s at Home’, that examines the horrific communal violence in Gujarat, and ‘War Talk: Summer Games with Nuclear Bombs’, about the threat of nuclear war in the Subcontinent.",The Algebra of Infinite Justice (Award-Winning Authors' Books),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143419280,"Edition,2017",252,India,English

White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India is a tale with many levels, featuring Captain James Achilles Kirkpatrick as the protagonist. On one level, the book details the tragic romance between Kirkpatrick and Khair-un-Nissa, a Muslim noblewoman. On a different level, the story sheds light on the social, military, political, and trade aspects of 18th and 19th century India.

Captain Kirkpatrick is an ambitious soldier in the East India Company. When his eyes settle upon the beautiful Khair, the Nizam’s great-niece, the course of his life takes a new direction. Kirkpatrick soon learns that he must overcome many obstacles in order to marry Khair. Firstly, she is locked in purdah and engaged to be married to a nobleman. Secondly, as a Resident, Kirkpatrick is obligated to convert to Islam, which he hopes will make it easier for him to marry Khair. Kirkpatrick also ends up working as a double-agent, while working for the East India Company, he is actually supporting the Hyderabadis.

Apart from this love story, Dalrymple, also presents a side of history which is virtually unexplored by historians. Through memorable characters such as Hindoo Stuart and Sir David Ochterlony, the author draws readers’ attention to the concept of “white Mughals”. These are people of British descent who had adopted Indian customs, traditions, but who were also a source of embarrassment for colonial administrations. After conducting over five years of research, the author portrays a fascinating portrait about social etiquette, sexual and dismissive attitudes, and the growing racist treatment by the ruling British class towards the offspring of mixed race couples.
White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India won the 2003 Scottish Book Of the Year. In 2011, Dalrymple announced that British actor Ralph Fiennes would act and direct the movie-version of book.

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California.

(This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.) 
Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention). 
We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.
Yeah, there's going to be trouble. Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.
On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again. 
Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.) 
Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

“The Starry Night” shows Sexton’s identification with another tortured and suicidal artist, Vincent van Gogh. The short, free-verse poem begins with an epigraph from one of van Gogh’s letters to his brother. “That does not keep me from having a terrible need of—shall I say the word—religion,” van Gogh wrote. “Then I go out at night to paint the stars.” Sexton used epigraphs from a variety of works to begin her poems, and the epigraphs are often of major importance, pointing to a main theme of the poem that might otherwise be overlooked. Here she is indicating that she shares not only the mental imbalance, suicidal tendencies, and artistic nature of the Dutch artist but also his unsatisfied desire for the spiritual.

When van Gogh wrote the letter to his brother, he was painting the masterpiece Starry Night on the Rhone, which is described in the poem. The painting captures the night sky in blues and blacks, with a swirl of violent orange representing the moon, and burning yellow-white stars. One would expect a peaceful scene from the title, but this painting is intensely disquieting. The movement seems to be a great rush skyward, the sleeping town beneath the sky unconscious of this spiraling of all nature toward infinity. Sexton sees this painting as a reflection of her own death wish. The dark tree at the edge of the painting is described as “black-haired”—Sexton was a brunette—and it “slips/ up like a drowned woman into the hot sky.” To make her meaning clearer, she continues, “This is how/ I want to die.”

The poem interprets the painting as presenting a nature that is animate and hostile. Nevertheless, the picture attracts the speaker, because nature’s brute force promises death, release from the burden of self. Sexton sees the central moon image in the painting as a great dragon that will suck her up into its being. She desires, she says, “to split/ from my life with no flag,/ no belly,/ no cry”—to merge silently and painlessly with the infinite. The images may suggest not a rediscovery of religion but a terrifying substitute for it. Part of the appeal of this poem lies in the vivid interpretation of the painting and in the kinship the reader sees between Sexton and van Gogh.",Starry Nights,Shobhaa De, , ,Penguin Books,9780143421313,"1st Edition,2013",315,India,English

Insiders know that besides her commitment to work and the frantic pace of her life, Shobhaa Dé's first priority in life has always been her family. Here she writes poignantly of her early years, and of her relationship with her parents and siblings, her husband and her children. Shobha De's high voltage career 'happened' in unexpected ways, starting with her unplanned entry as a teenager into the glamorous world of modeling, and moving on to her high-profile years as a magazine editor. In these avatars she keenly observed and astutely chronicled the new India— brash, affluent and ambitious. High-society hi-jinks, movie star follies, celebrity neurosis— none of these escaped her unsparing eye. And now she tells it all, just as it was, just as she saw it. In her inimitably forthright fashion, she writes of the choices she made, the decisions she took and the influences that shaped her.

One Hundred Years Of Solitude, a literary masterpiece by the Nobel Laureate, is a metaphoric mirror to Colombian history. The contemplative novel drapes the tale of the rise and fall of Macondo and magically captures the life and times of the Buendia family over seven generations.  

Summary Of The Book:
Set in a fictional town called Macondo in Northern Colombia, One Hundred Years Of Solitude begins with Jose Arcadio Buendia leaving his hometown with his wife Ursula, in search of a better life. One night during their journey, they happen to camp at a riverside where Jose dreams about a spectacular city and decides to establish one on the same riverbank. Thus, he builds Macondo and slowly shapes it into how he wants a city to be. Macondo then begins to miraculously attract unusual people and extraordinary events that make for a gripping plot. The adventurous Buendias find themselves in the middle of some of the most historically potent 
circumstances in Colombia. As the lineage stands in the face of the glory and downfall of a civilization, Marquez's lyrical magic manifests the delicate nuances of love and war, youth and senility, and passion and lust. And finally, what had started as an innocent dream of Jose, Ursula and 19 other families gradually break down and fall prey to lawless anarchy. 

One Hundred Years Of Solitude also chronicles the political and economic developments of the 19th century Colombia, such as corruption and capitalism with a touch of fiction. In a deeply touching and thought provoking non-linear narrative, Marquez paints a hundred years of history on the canvas of time. He uses his prerogative of having witnessed the wave of the Colombian revolution to graphically depict its lasting influence. He arrests in prose, the magical realism surrounding life, death, peace and the truth of mankind. 

Written originally in Spanish, One Hundred Years Of Solitude was published first in 1967. It has since been translated into 37 languages and sold more than 20 million copies worldover. A recipient of global acclaim and numerous awards, the book won Marquez his Nobel Prize in 1982.

The book starts with Greg writing about how his mother is always saying that ""friends will come and go but family is forever."" Greg doesn't believe that, since his friend, Rowley, now has a girlfriend named Abigail, continuing from the events of the last book. Ever since then, Rowley has been acting different, such as refusing to hang out with Greg and agreeing with everything Abigail says.

Greg has been getting bored without Rowley, so his mother tells him to ""branch out"" and make friends with the kids in the neighborhood. He decides to become friends with Fregley, since he could ""mold him into EXACTLY the type of friend [he] need[s]."" Greg tries to get Fregley to do funny things during lunch, and Fregley then becomes popular after the other kids find out that he can ""chew"" food with his belly button.

Greg's mother announces that her extended family will come to town for Easter. Greg then writes about some of his family members, including Meemaw, who organized egg hunts in the backyard. On Easter, the family notices through a photo album that Meemaw has hidden her diamond ring in an egg, and everyone rushes out to find it, although the search is unsuccessful.

Greg decides to join an after-school activity, and with the help of a Magic 8-Ball he found on Easter, he becomes a member of the Yearbook Club. The next day, Greg accidentally drops his Magic 8-Ball, and it breaks. Greg is called to the yearbook office to take yearbook photos of Fregley (Most Popular) and Rowley and Abigail (Cutest Couple). He then resigns from his position.

Greg throws his broken Magic 8-Ball into his grandmother's yard. At school, he learns that Rowley and Abigail have broken up. Greg wonders if he and Rowley should be friends again. He goes back to the Magic 8-Ball, hoping to get ""one last good answer,"" and finds the plastic egg with Meemaw's ring. To avoid breaking up his family, he hides the egg in his mother's closet.

Greg concludes that he has to make big decisions on his own, and reconciles with Rowley. He writes, ""I know Mom's always saying that friends come and go and family is forever, and maybe that's true. [...] I'm sure me and Rowley will get in another fight somewhere down the road and then we'll go through this drama all over again. But for now, we're good.""",Diary of a Wimpy Kid : Hard Luck,Jeff Kinney, , ,Penguin Books,9780141353074,"Edition,2016",236,India,English

The God of Small Things is the debut novel of Indian writer Arundhati Roy. It is a story about the childhood experiences of fraternal twins whose lives are destroyed by the ""Love Laws"" that lay down ""who should be loved, and how. And how much."" The book explores how the small things affect people's behavior and their lives. It won the Booker Prize in 1997.

ndian history and politics shape the plot and meaning of The God of Small Things in a variety of ways. Some of Roy's commentary is on the surface, with jokes and snippets of wisdom about political realities in India. However, the novel also examines the historical roots of these realities and develops profound insights into the ways in which human desperation and desire emerge from the confines of a firmly entrenched caste society.

The story is set in the caste society of India, at a time when members of the Untouchable Paravan or Paryan caste were not permitted to touch members of higher castes or enter their houses. The Untouchables were considered polluted beings. They had the lowliest jobs and lived in subhuman conditions. In India, the caste system was considered a way to organize society. Roy's book shows how terribly cruel such a system can be.

Along with the caste system, readers see an economic class struggle. The Ipes are considered upper class. They are factory owners, the dominating class. Mammachi and Baby Kochamma would not deign to mix with those of a lower class.

However, Roy shows other types of less evident discrimination. For example, there is religious discrimination. It is unacceptable for a Syrian Christian to marry a Hindu and vice versa, and Hindus can only marry a Hindu from the same caste. In more than one passage of the book, the reader feels Rahel's and Estha's discomfort at being half Hindu. Baby Kochamma constantly makes disparaging comments about Hindus. On the other hand, there is discomfort even between Christian denominations as is shown by Pappachi's negative reaction when Baby Kochamma converts to Catholicism.

Chacko suffers more veiled racial discrimination, as it seems his daughter also does. His English wife's parents were shocked and disapproving that their daughter would marry an Indian, no matter how well educated. Sophie, at one point, mentions to her cousins that they are all ""wog,"" while she is ""half-wog.""

The Ipes are very class-conscious and feel a need to maintain their status. Discrimination is a way of protecting their privileged position in society.",The God of Small Things (Man Booker Prize 1997),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143028574,"1st Published,2002",340,India,English

The Partition in history is a record of a point in time when the country was split apart along religious lines. It is an abstract piece of history for most people. While many books have documented the Partition and the violence surrounding it, most have focused on the social and political causes, and analyzed it as a collection of abstract data. Train To Pakistan is one of the books that focuses on the human drama, the real suffering of the people caught in the middle.
Mano Majra is a village that suddenly becomes part of a border between two countries. The population of the village is predominantly Sikh and Muslim. When news of communal riots and killings reach the village, the different communities express their support for each other and swear to defend one another. However, external influences are just waiting around the corner to disturb this idyllic harmony.
A train filled with the massacred bodies of Hindus and Sikhs arrives at Mano Majra. Slowly, passions gets stoked up, especially by the influx of refugees from the newly created Pakistan. They have tales of horror to tell, and the passions of Sikhs and Hindus of the village are stirred up.
Vested interests, including that of the village magistrate’s, stir up the flames. Hindus and Sikhs who just recently swore to stand by their Muslim neighbors now turn against them. Caught in all this are Juggut Singh and Iqbal. Juggut is a criminal, while Iqbal is a western educated intellectual who is on a mission to reform society. The common thread that binds them together is that they are both thrown into jail as suspects in a murder.
Ram Lal, a local moneylender, has been murdered. Ram Lal was a Hindu and this is used by subversive elements to incite violence against Muslims. The police, in a desperate attempt to divert attention, arrest Iqbal and Juggut.
Meanwhile, as the violence escalates, a train arrives to take the Muslim population of the village en masse to Pakistan.

Glimpses Of World History was written by Nehru in 1934, which provides the readers a panoramic sweep of history, comprising 196 letters in total. These letters were written from a number of prisons in British India from 1930 to 1933. The sole objective of these letters was to introduce Nehru’s daughter, Indira, to world history. In his first letter, Nehru tells Indira about his sadness at being unable to send her any material gift from prison. He goes on to tell her that he would give her something he could afford, which was a series of letters, straight from his heart.

Since these letters were written during his time in prison, Nehru didn’t have access to any reference books, but only his personal notes. Through the course of this book, he covers the history of mankind from 6000 BC till the time he wrote this book. He tells the readers about the rise and fall of large civilizations and empires from Rome, Greece, West Asia, and China. He also throws light on several renowned historical figures such as Genghis Khan, Vladimir Lenin, Mohandas K. Gandhi, and Ashoka. One of his chapters talks about Genghis Khan and the Mongol invasion in a way that is against major European views of that time. He mentions that Genghis was, without doubt, history’s greatest military genius and leader, considering Alexander and Caesar petty before Genghis.

He wrote about several cultures in detail, as he wasn’t in favor of the current way history was taught at school. Owing to the fact that history teaching at school revolved only around a particular country, he wrote about world history to his daughter, to help her understand why people did what they did. These letters have been written in an informal manner, packed with contemporary as well as personal experiences.

In The Outsider (1942), his classic existentialist novel, Camus explores the alienation of an individual who refuses to conform to social norms. Meursault, his anti-hero, will not lie. When his mother dies, he refuses to show his emotions simply to satisfy the expectations of others. And when he commits a random act of violence on a sun-drenched beach near Algiers, his lack of remorse compounds his guilt in the eyes of society and the law. Yet he is as much a victim as a criminal.

Albert Camus' portrayal of a man confronting the absurd, and revolting against the injustice of society, depicts the paradox of man's joy in life when faced with the 'tender indifference' of the world.

Sandra Smith's translation, based on close listening to a recording of Camus reading his work aloud on French radio in 1954, sensitively renders the subtleties and dream-like atmosphere of L'?tranger.

Albert Camus (1913-1960), French novelist, essayist and playwright, is one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. His most famous works include The Myth of Sisyphus (1942), The Plague (1947), The Just (1949), The Rebel (1951) and The Fall (1956). He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, and his last novel, The First Man, unfinished at the time of his death, appeared in print for the first time in 1994, and was published in English soon after by Hamish Hamilton.

Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is a 2012 non-fiction book written by Susan Cain. Cain argues that modern Western culture misunderstands and undervalues the traits and capabilities of introverted people, leading to ""a colossal waste of talent, energy, and happiness"".

The book presents a history of how Western culture transformed from a culture of character to a culture of personality in which an ""extrovert ideal"" dominates and introversion is viewed as inferior or even pathological. Adopting scientific definitions of introversion and extroversion as preferences for different levels of stimulation, Quiet outlines the advantages and disadvantages of each temperament, emphasizing the myth of the extrovert ideal that has dominated in the West since the early twentieth century. Asserting that temperament is a core element of human identity, Cain cites research in biology, psychology, neuroscience and evolution to demonstrate that introversion is both common and normal, noting that many of humankind's most creative individuals and distinguished leaders were introverts. Cain urges changes at the workplace, in schools, and in parenting; offers advice to introverts for functioning in an extrovert-dominated culture; and offers advice in communication, work, and relationships between people of differing temperament.",Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can not Stop Talking,Susan Cain, , ,Penguin Books,9780307352156,"1st Edition,2013",348,Abroad,English

Love in the Time of Cholera is a celebration of life over death, love over despair, and health over sickness. It is the story of Florentino Ariza, who was rejected by Fermina Daza in his youth. He maintains a silent vigil of unrequited love for fifty-one years, nine months, and four days, until he meets Fermina again at her husband’s wake and renews his suit. The novel spans a period from the late 1870’s to the early 1930’s, and it is set in a South American community modeled after Cartagena, Colombia, and besieged by civil wars and plagues.

Florentino, an eighteen-year-old apprentice telegraph operator, sees thirteen-year old Fermina and falls madly in love. Fermina’s father finds out and sends his daughter on an extended trip to remove her from temptation. She returns years later, rejects Florentino, and accepts the proposal of a cultured physician and cholera specialist, Dr. Juvenal Urbino. Although Florentino continues to love Fermina throughout the years, he also continues his own social relationships—engaging in 622 long-term liaisons, which he records in a series of notebooks—and becomes president of a riverboat company. Then Florentino learns that eighty-one-year-old Juvenal has died, falling off a ladder trying to capture a condescending, bilingual parrot.

Land of Two Rivers: A History of Bengal provides an incisive look into the history of Bengal, one of the most fascinating and influential regions in the Indian subcontinent. Located at the confluence of two major rivers, Ganga and Brahmaputra, Bengal has been the center of trade, learning and the arts for the longest time. In the medieval era, the rise of Muslim dynasties in Bengal brought into being a unique culture which was very different from that of northern India. The British colonization in the 18th century further transformed the social and economic structure of the region. In this book, the author traces the formation of Bengali identity through the Bengal Renaissance, the growth of nationalist politics and partition of Bengal in 1947. This book will make for an engaging and informative read for those interested in the history of Bengal.

The story unfolds on a cold April day in 1984 in Oceania, the totalitarian superpower in post World War II Europe. Winston Smith, employed as a records (no, not vinyl) editor at the Ministry of Truth, drags himself home to Victory Mansions (nothing victorious about them) for lunch. Depressed and oppressed, he starts a journal of his rebellious thoughts against the Party. If discovered, this journal will result in his execution. Now that’s playing with fire. For the sake of added precautions, Winston only writes when safe from the view of the surveying telescreens. And when that shot of industrial grade ""Victory Gin"" kicks in.

At work, Winston becomes curious about ""the brunette"" (a.k.a. Julia), a machine-operator in the Fiction Department. Although at one time he feared that she was a member of the Thought Police, all such paranoia ends when she slips him a note reading ""I love you"" in the corridor one day. The two begin a secret love affair, first meeting up in the countryside, and then in a rented room atop Mr. Charrington’s shop in the prole district. All of these places are away from surveillance – or so they think.

As Winston and Julia fall deeper in love, Winston’s views about their government (the Party) change. There’s something about Ingsoc that doesn’t seem quite right – is it the manipulation? The changing of history? The all-around sketchiness? Winston is drawn to the revolutionary ""Brotherhood"" because, well, they’re revolutionary. Eventually, Winston makes contact with O’Brien, who Winston thinks is a member of the Brotherhood, but who in actuality is a member of the Thought Police. O’Brien arranges for Winston to receive a copy of ""the book,"" a resistance manifesto which supposedly exposes the how and the why for the resistance.

Unfortunately, Winston never finds out the why. Instead, he gets tortured. But before the torturing, he and Julia are apprehended by the Thought Police. Turns out that secret hiding place wasn’t so secret after all. The happy couple is then brought to the Ministry of Love, where criminals and opponents of the Party are tortured, interrogated, and ""reintegrated"" before their release and ultimate execution. O’Brien runs the show as far as Winston’s torture sessions are concerned.

Months later, Winston is sent to Room 101, where a person is faced with his greatest fear. Rats…why did it have to be rats? Musing on the impending rats-chewing-on-his-face scenario, Winston calls out, ""Do it to Julia!"" That’s pretty much what O’Brien was looking for, so Winston gets to go back to being a happy member of the rat race. Released, Winston’s heart is filled with love for the Party. Even when he and Julia meet again by chance, they feel apathetic towards each other. The last man in Europe has been converted and destroyed. Quite the fine point there, George.

This results in ""a sort of gender-based Planet of the Apes where the roles are reversed and the men are locked away in a technologically advanced future.

There, traditional stereotypes such as “Men have bigger brains” and women are ""naturally weak"" are countered with logic such as ""an elephant also has a bigger and heavier brain"" and “a lion is stronger than a man” and yet neither of them dominates men.[3] In Ladyland crime is eliminated, since men were considered responsible for all of it. The workday is only two hours long, since men used to waste six hours of each day in smoking. The religion is one of love and truth.

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.)

Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention).

We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.

Yeah, there's going to be trouble.

Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.

On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again.

Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.)

Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

Marquez's novel is very repetitive and nonlinear, so we're going to lay it down for you in a straightforward and chronological order. It's not what Marquez intended, but it sure is easier to understand.

Six months before 'the incident,' Bayardo San Román comes barging into town looking like he's the best thing since sliced bread. No one knows who he is, and the only thing they do know is that he's looking for a wife. Apparently no one in town thinks this is sketchy, so we'll roll with it too.

One day he randomly chooses Angela as his bride-to-be, despite the fact that she has no interest in him at all. His unrequited love is totally in line with his sketchy character, but everyone seems to ignore the sketch-factor because the dude's richer than Bill Gates. Anyway, Angela's lack of love for Bayardo is not the only problem. She has a secret: She's not a virgin.

Angela's impoverished family doesn't care about this fact and they basically force her into marrying Bayardo. After four months, they have the biggest wedding the town has ever seen. Everyone who's anyone (and some people who aren't even anyone) comes to the party. But it all comes crashing down on their wedding night when it's revealed that Angela is not a virgin.

Bayardo takes her back home, where Angela's mom beats her for about two hours. She tells her brothers that Santiago is the guy who deflowered her, and that's when the murder plot begins.

The next day, the town is still in a festive mood because the Bishop is supposed to visit. They even have crazy amounts of roosters prepared for his favorite cock-comb soup. So even though it's Monday, everything is not operating the way it would normally, which is unfortunate for poor Santiago.

In the hours that follow, everything that could go wrong does go wrong. It's like the darkest black comedy you've ever seen. By 6 AM everyone in town knows that the brothers are going to kill Santiago, but no one does anything. Even though the brothers don't want to kill him, no one stops them. What the heck is up with this town?

In the end, Santiago is killed at his own doorstep.

After the murder, the whole town can't stop talking about it. Angela's family leaves town and so does her husband of five hours. There's even a trial, but it doesn't seem that anything comes of it aside from some pretty cool records written in red ink.

Years later, our narrator goes around talking to the residents of the town. He tries to get some kind of truth, but we don't get anything concrete except for one sad truth: Santiago is dead.

Our lives and specifically the market are so full of random aspects and complex structures. Understanding the behaviour of markets and attributing specific reasons to its behaviour is totally impossible and sometimes a useless task. As the title explains, Taleb’s theory explains how all of us get fooled easily by randomness. Taleb goes on to elaborate how we misconstrue luck and skill. Wherever true luck plays a role, we assume it to be the work of individual skill. Most impressive situations in life are only due to luck, claims Taleb. He uses the theory of black swans (rare events) to propound his idea and says that black swans cannot be predicted.

Taleb elucidates his theory through some popular examples using people like the baseball expert Yogi Berra, the philosopher Karl Popper, the ancient wise man Solon, the financier George Soros and the Greek voyager Odysseus. Most of all, journalists and traders fall for the randomness as well. In addition to real-life examples, Taleb also brings in the case of the fictitious hero Nero, who is smart enough to understand the play of randomness in his professional life, but is superstitiously foolish.

Taleb also constructs an invincible, nameless fool who seems to be at the right place at the right time. The fool has a steady string of followers who are ready to do anything for their Guru. But, the fool’s actions cannot be imitated. His success is one obtained by chance.

The most unexpected things will happen for sure. But, we become creatures of routine that we fail to identify it when it happens. Moreover, detecting risks and accepting them is done only by the emotional part of the brain. If we understand probability, then we can perceive the role of luck in everyday situations. The trick lies in recognizing it. Taleb says we must be aware of the trap that luck sets for us.

How do we distinguish a lucky poseur from a far-sighted visionary? How do we read an incident? How do we decide whether it is luck or talent that made the person successful?

Fooled By Randomness: The Hidden Role Of Chance In The Markets And In Life received wide recognition. Fortune named it as one of the smartest books of all time and the Financial Times termed it as the Book of the Year.

Is life worth living? If life does not possess any significance when confronted with the reality of human existence, is suicide our only alternative? In the essay, Camus introduces the readers to his philosophy of the absurd where man’s futile search for meaning, unity and clarity is questioned. The author states that to realize the reason for our existence, we need to break the norms of normalcy and revolt. During the course of the book, Camus outlines numerous approaches to the absurd life. The author compares the absurdity of human life with the situation of Sisyphus, a Greek mythological figure who was condemned to forever repeat a meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain only to see it roll down again.

In a very engaging and interesting manner, the author states that humans should embrace the absurd. By embracing the absurd, it means that we accept all the unreasonable things that the world has to offer. Camus arrives at three consequences from the full acknowledgement of the absurd, revolt, freedom and passion. How then should the absurd man live? What is the purpose of life? Is suicide the answer to all the problems in life? Through a philosophical series of questioning, this book truly depicts life in a unique and refreshing manner. The book is for all those people who are interested in the philosophy of existentialism, this book will truly engage the readers till the last page.

Camus has drawn some very powerful consequences about life and mortality. Knowing the fact that one day all of us are going to die is a great liberator. Therefore traditions accepted as morals, ethics accepted as habits, all cease to be less important when we know that our time on the planet is limited. An oversimplified version of the essay is that man is only a small part of a vast and endless universe and that the most a man can do is to live their life to the fullest at every moment.

The story unfolds on a cold April day in 1984 in Oceania, the totalitarian superpower in post World War II Europe. Winston Smith, employed as a records (no, not vinyl) editor at the Ministry of Truth, drags himself home to Victory Mansions (nothing victorious about them) for lunch. Depressed and oppressed, he starts a journal of his rebellious thoughts against the Party. If discovered, this journal will result in his execution. Now that’s playing with fire. For the sake of added precautions, Winston only writes when safe from the view of the surveying telescreens. And when that shot of industrial grade ""Victory Gin"" kicks in.
At work, Winston becomes curious about ""the brunette"" (a.k.a. Julia), a machine-operator in the Fiction Department. Although at one time he feared that she was a member of the Thought Police, all such paranoia ends when she slips him a note reading ""I love you"" in the corridor one day. The two begin a secret love affair, first meeting up in the countryside, and then in a rented room atop Mr. Charrington’s shop in the prole district. All of these places are away from surveillance – or so they think. 
As Winston and Julia fall deeper in love, Winston’s views about their government (the Party) change. There’s something about Ingsoc that doesn’t seem quite right – is it the manipulation? The changing of history? The all-around sketchiness? Winston is drawn to the revolutionary ""Brotherhood"" because, well, they’re revolutionary. Eventually, Winston makes contact with O’Brien, who Winston thinks is a member of the Brotherhood, but who in actuality is a member of the Thought Police. O’Brien arranges for Winston to receive a copy of ""the book,"" a resistance manifesto which supposedly exposes the how and the why for the resistance. 
Unfortunately, Winston never finds out the why. Instead, he gets tortured. But before the torturing, he and Julia are apprehended by the Thought Police. Turns out that secret hiding place wasn’t so secret after all. The happy couple is then brought to the Ministry of Love, where criminals and opponents of the Party are tortured, interrogated, and ""reintegrated"" before their release and ultimate execution. O’Brien runs the show as far as Winston’s torture sessions are concerned. 
Months later, Winston is sent to Room 101, where a person is faced with his greatest fear. Rats…why did it have to be rats? Musing on the impending rats-chewing-on-his-face scenario, Winston calls out, ""Do it to Julia!"" That’s pretty much what O’Brien was looking for, so Winston gets to go back to being a happy member of the rat race. Released, Winston’s heart is filled with love for the Party. Even when he and Julia meet again by chance, they feel apathetic towards each other. The last man in Europe has been converted and destroyed. Quite the fine point there, George.

This book serves as a follow-up book to the author’s bestselling 1999 book, The Power Of Now, which promoted the idea that in order to achieve lasting happiness, human beings must learn to dissociate their thoughts from their identities. A New Earth: Create A Better Life builds extensively upon the same primary theme, exploring a different perspective this time around.

The first book had an introspective quality and focused on the spiritual needs of the individual. On the other hand, this book turns the spotlight outwards, choosing to highlight the ways in which an individual’s spiritual evolution can be instrumental in shaping humanity’s collective spiritual consciousness.

Divided into ten chapters, the book begins with a chapter on the awakening of human consciousness. The next three chapters focus on the concept of ego, exploring how attachment towards one’s thoughts, memories, and possessions can give rise to an illusory and harmful sense of self.

In the subsequent chapters, the author discusses concepts such as recurring emotional pain, the space of consciousness, and inner and outer purpose. The final chapter presents the three elements that the author considers to be collectively representative of an awakened consciousness.

A New Earth: Create A Better Life was first published in 2005 by Penguin. It went on to receive high worldwide acclaim, its popularity scaling further when it was chosen as a recommended title by Oprah Winfrey’s Book Club in 2008. This edition is a 2009 reprint by Penguin Books.

The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Late Spring and Autumn Period (roughly 5th century BC). The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (""Master Sun"", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to an aspect of warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare[1] and has influenced both Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy and beyond.

This book contained a detailed explanation and analysis of the Chinese military, from weapons and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun Tzu also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Because Sun Tzu has long been considered to be one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training for centuries to come.
Chapter summary
1. Detail assessment and planning: explores the five fundamental factors (the Way, seasons, terrain, leadership, and management) and seven elements that determine the outcomes of military engagements. By thinking, assessing and comparing these points, a commander can calculate his chances of victory. Habitual deviation from these calculations will ensure failure via improper action. The text stresses that war is a very grave matter for the state and must not be commenced without due consideration.
2. Waging war : explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how success requires winning decisive engagements quickly. This section advises that successful military campaigns require limiting the cost of competition and conflict.
3. Strategic attack : defines the source of strength as unity, not size, and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war. In order of importance, these critical factors are: Attack, Strategy, Alliances, Army and Cities.
4. Disposition of the army : explains the importance of defending existing positions until a commander is capable of advancing from those positions in safety. It teaches commanders the importance of recognizing strategic opportunities, and teaches not to create opportunities for the enemy.
5. Forces : explains the use of creativity and timing in building an army's momentum.
6. Weaknesses and strengths : explains how an army's opportunities come from the openings in the environment caused by the relative weakness of the enemy and how to respond to changes in the fluid battlefield over a given area.
7. Military maneuvers : explains the dangers of direct conflict and how to win those confrontations when they are forced upon the commander.
8. Variations and adaptability : focuses on the need for flexibility in an army's responses. It explains how to respond to shifting circumstances successfully.
9. Movement and development of troops : describes the different situations in which an army finds itself as it moves through new enemy territories, and how to respond to these situations. Much of this section focuses on evaluating the intentions of others.
10. Terrain : looks at the three general areas of resistance (distance, dangers and barriers) and the six types of ground positions that arise from them. Each of these six field positions offers certain advantages and disadvantages.
11. The nine battlegrounds : describes the nine common situations (or stages) in a campaign, from scattering to deadly, and the specific focus that a commander will need in order to successfully navigate them.
12. Attacking with fire : explains the general use of weapons and the specific use of the environment as a weapon. This section examines the five targets for attack, the five types of environmental attack and the appropriate responses to such attacks.
13. Intelligence and espionage : focuses on the importance of developing good information sources, and specifies the five types of intelligence sources and how to best manage each of them.",The Art of War,Sun Tzu,John Minford, ,Penguin Books,9780140455526,"1st edition,2008",112,India,English

“Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None” is a novel by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche that was originally published in four parts between 1883 and 1891.

The novel is a philosophical treatise on Nietzsche’s ideals and his idea of the “overman”. Several of the philosopher’s most famous concepts are introduced in the novel. Including the idea that God is dead (meaning that societies old foundations are dead and that the idea of good and evil has changed) and the “eternal recurrence of the same” or the idea that time is an everlasting line and that anything that can happen has already happened and will happen again eventually.


 
Nietzsche uses the protagonist of the fifth century B.C.E. Philosopher, Zarathustra in order to tell the story. Zarathustra comes down from his mountain top cave to preach to the people about the Overman but is soon rebuked. The book is mainly comprised of Zarathustra’s lessons to the people and to himself.

Globalization has been viewed as a perfect solution for the problems of many weak and nascent economies. A globally integrated economy that allowed the free flow of capital across borders was supposed to benefit the countries that opened up their markets.

That idea has not really worked out well in many places. There is an increasing number of voices protesting against globalization policies. This book, Globalization And Its Discontents analyses the reasons for this rising opposition.

The book does not explicitly take an anti globalization stand. It just inquires into the failures of the idea in certain regions of the world. It examines the factors that contributed towards this failure. The author mainly focuses on the policies of international organizations like the IMF and the World Bank. He says that the global organizations employed a one solution fits all policy. They did not take into account the unique problems and needs of each country that they tried to help. They simply worked on the belief that a free market was the cure to all economic ills.

The author takes up the cases of South Asia and Russia to illustrate his points. He says institutions like the IMF encouraged free flow of capital even in regions without a strongly regulated financial sector. This left the field open for speculative short term investors. These investors panicked and pulled out at the slightest signs of an economic crisis. This destabilized the already weak economies of many developing countries, and whole nations went bankrupt.

The loans from IMF imposed strict conditions on the borrowing countries. These included asking the countries to cut their expenditure on public spending like food subsidies. When economies collapsed and many people lost their jobs, they did not even have a social safety net to fall back on. This led to social and political unrest in countries like Indonesia and Russia. So, the institutions that were supposed to help these countries strengthen their economies instead worsened the crisis, says the author. Globalization And Its Discontents says globalization as such is not a bad idea. It brings in global funding into poor economies and opens up new opportunities and new markets.

What is needed, says the author, are reforms in the functioning of institutions like the IMF. He says that there is need for increased transparency and accountability in these organizations.

The Metamorphosis and Other Stories, by Franz Kafka, is part of the Barnes and Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes and Noble Classics:
All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes and Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.


Virtually unknown during his lifetime, Franz Kafka is now one of the world’s most widely read and discussed authors. His nightmarish novels and short stories have come to symbolize modern man’s anxiety and alienation in a bizarre, hostile, and dehumanized world. This vision is most fully realized in Kafka’s masterpiece, “The Metamorphosis,” a story that is both harrowing and amusing, and a landmark of modern literature. 

Bringing together some of Kafka’s finest work, this collection demonstrates the richness and variety of the author’s artistry. “The Judgment,” which Kafka considered to be his decisive breakthrough, and “The Stoker,” which became the first chapter of his novel Amerika, are here included. These two, along with “The Metamorphosis,” form a suite of stories Kafka referred to as “The Sons,” and they collectively present a devastating portrait of the modern family.

Also included are “In the Penal Colony,” a story of a torture machine and its operators and victims, and “A Hunger Artist,” about the absurdity of an artist trying to communicate with a misunderstanding public. Kafka’s lucid, succinct writing chronicles the labyrinthine complexities, the futility-laden horror, and the stifling oppressiveness that permeate his vision of modern life.

Justice has multiple dimensions and cannot be defined as or decided upon in singular terms. It can mean different things to different people in different instances. It is, in simple words, understood as existing and varying on a continuum. This is the central aspect of the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen’s book, The Idea Of Justice.

This remarkable book by the distinguished economist questions the very notion of social justice being a far-fetched ideal or an achievable and practical possibility. The book defines a perfectly just society and also traces the concept of social justice as understood by philosophers and thinkers over ages. People have continued to face differences in opinions regarding what is just and what is not, and the book places special emphasis on the alternative and comparative perspectives on justice.

The author has introduced an approach to justice followed by the demands of justice, materials of justice, forms of reasoning, and public reasoning and democracy. Within the four parts the book has been divided into are chapters covering endlessly thought-provoking topics.

This book, published in 2009, is dedicated to the memory of one of Amartya Sen’s teachers, named John Rawls. Rawls wrote a book titled A Theory Of Justice, from which Sen has picked up arguments and provided a detailed evaluation of these compelling arguments. Sen has discussed the positions of justice and the situation of original position as highlighted by Rawls in his book.

This is a monumental work is a must-read for all who wish to stir their thoughts and re-think, especially in present times when the world is quivering with questions related to global justice and fairness. A masterful text, this book provides an insight into what can make societies more just rather than making it seem like an endeavour towards a mere utopian dream.",The Idea of Justice,Amartya Sen, , ,Penguin Books,9780141037851,"1st Published,2010",468,India,English

The first playwright to depict suffering without reference to the gods, Euripides (484-407 BC) made his characters speak in human terms and face the consequences of their actions. In Medea, a woman rejected by her lover takes hideous revenge by murdering the children they both love, and Hecabe depicts the former queen of Troy, driven mad by the prospect of her daughter's sacrifice to Achilles. Electra portrays a young woman planning to avenge the brutal death of her father at the hands of her mother, while in Heracles the hero seeks vengeance against the evil king who has caused bloodshed in his family.

The journey in The Discovery of India begins from ancient history, leading up to the last years of the British Raj. He uses his knowledge of the Upanishads, Vedas, and textbooks on ancient history to introduce to the reader the development of India from the Indus Valley Civilization, through the changes in socio-political old scene scenario every foreign invader brought, to the present day conditions.

Nehru was jailed for his participation in the Quit India movement along with other Indian leaders, and he used this time to write down his thoughts and knowledge about India's history. The book is widely regarded as a classic in India since its first publication in 1946[citation needed], and provides a broad view of Indian history, philosophy and culture, as viewed from the eyes of a liberal Indian fighting for the independence of his country.

In The Discovery of India, Nehru argued that India was a historic nation with a right to sovereignty. This book also analyses in depth the philosophy of Indian life. (wikipedia.org)",The Discovery of India,Jawaharlal Nehru, , ,Penguin Books,9780143031031,"Reprinted,2010",642,India,English

He Algebra of Infinite Justice (2001) is a collection of essays written by Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy. The book discusses several perspectives of global and local concerns, among them one being the abuse of Nuclear bomb showoffs.

The book discusses several issues from fields as diverse as the political euphoria in India over its successful nuclear bomb tests, the 'power' politics wherein she discusses the power generating companies of the world manipulating the laws and policies of the many power-deprived nations.

Introduction:

A few weeks after India detonated a thermonuclear device in 1998, Arundhati Roy wrote ‘The End of Imagination’. The essay attracted worldwide attention as the voice of a brilliant Indian writer speaking out with clarity and conscience against nuclear weapons. Over the next three and a half years, she wrote a series of political essays on a diverse range of momentous subjects: from the illusory benefits of big dams, to the downside of corporate globalization and the US Government’s war against terror. First published in 2001, The Algebra of Infinite Justice brings together all of Arundhati Roy’s political writings so far. This revised paperback edition includes two new essays, written in early 2002: ‘Democracy: Who’s She When She’s at Home’, that examines the horrific communal violence in Gujarat, and ‘War Talk: Summer Games with Nuclear Bombs’, about the threat of nuclear war in the Subcontinent.",The Algebra of Infinite Justice (Award-Winning Authors' Books),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143419280,"Edition,2017",252,India,English

His entire life history, from even before his father was born, seems to have led him naturally to where he was.

White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India is a tale with many levels, featuring Captain James Achilles Kirkpatrick as the protagonist. On one level, the book details the tragic romance between Kirkpatrick and Khair-un-Nissa, a Muslim noblewoman. On a different level, the story sheds light on the social, military, political, and trade aspects of 18th and 19th century India.

Captain Kirkpatrick is an ambitious soldier in the East India Company. When his eyes settle upon the beautiful Khair, the Nizam’s great-niece, the course of his life takes a new direction. Kirkpatrick soon learns that he must overcome many obstacles in order to marry Khair. Firstly, she is locked in purdah and engaged to be married to a nobleman. Secondly, as a Resident, Kirkpatrick is obligated to convert to Islam, which he hopes will make it easier for him to marry Khair. Kirkpatrick also ends up working as a double-agent, while working for the East India Company, he is actually supporting the Hyderabadis.

Apart from this love story, Dalrymple, also presents a side of history which is virtually unexplored by historians. Through memorable characters such as Hindoo Stuart and Sir David Ochterlony, the author draws readers’ attention to the concept of “white Mughals”. These are people of British descent who had adopted Indian customs, traditions, but who were also a source of embarrassment for colonial administrations. After conducting over five years of research, the author portrays a fascinating portrait about social etiquette, sexual and dismissive attitudes, and the growing racist treatment by the ruling British class towards the offspring of mixed race couples.
White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India won the 2003 Scottish Book Of the Year. In 2011, Dalrymple announced that British actor Ralph Fiennes would act and direct the movie-version of book.

Emraan Hashmi is not just a charming face or an unconventional actor. He is not just bold in his character portrayals. Hashmi, or Emmi as his family members call him, is also a father who is level-headed, unfazed and unyielding.

The Kiss of Life is about that time in Hashmi's life when his son needed him the most, the time when all his other experiences paled in comparison to the tennis ball tumour that invaded his son's kidney.

The chapters alternate between the present - the hospital wards, chemo and the shivers - and the past, where Hashmi battles his own doubts of being an actor, the ups and downs in his career, the media branding him as a serial kisser, the typecasting and so on.

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.) 
Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention). 
We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.
Yeah, there's going to be trouble. Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.
On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again. 
Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.) 
Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

The short, free-verse poem begins with an epigraph from one of van Gogh’s letters to his brother. “That does not keep me from having a terrible need of—shall I say the word—religion,” van Gogh wrote. “Then I go out at night to paint the stars.” Sexton used epigraphs from a variety of works to begin her poems, and the epigraphs are often of major importance, pointing to a main theme of the poem that might otherwise be overlooked. Here she is indicating that she shares not only the mental imbalance, suicidal tendencies, and artistic nature of the Dutch artist but also his unsatisfied desire for the spiritual.

When van Gogh wrote the letter to his brother, he was painting the masterpiece Starry Night on the Rhone, which is described in the poem. The painting captures the night sky in blues and blacks, with a swirl of violent orange representing the moon, and burning yellow-white stars. One would expect a peaceful scene from the title, but this painting is intensely disquieting. The movement seems to be a great rush skyward, the sleeping town beneath the sky unconscious of this spiraling of all nature toward infinity. Sexton sees this painting as a reflection of her own death wish. The dark tree at the edge of the painting is described as “black-haired”—Sexton was a brunette—and it “slips/ up like a drowned woman into the hot sky.” To make her meaning clearer, she continues, “This is how/ I want to die.”

The poem interprets the painting as presenting a nature that is animate and hostile. Nevertheless, the picture attracts the speaker, because nature’s brute force promises death, release from the burden of self. Sexton sees the central moon image in the painting as a great dragon that will suck her up into its being. She desires, she says, “to split/ from my life with no flag,/ no belly,/ no cry”—to merge silently and painlessly with the infinite. The images may suggest not a rediscovery of religion but a terrifying substitute for it. Part of the appeal of this poem lies in the vivid interpretation of the painting and in the kinship the reader sees between Sexton and van Gogh.",Starry Nights,Shobhaa De, , ,Penguin Books,9780143421313,"1st Edition,2013",315,India,English

Insiders know that besides her commitment to work and the frantic pace of her life, Shobhaa Dé's first priority in life has always been her family. Here she writes poignantly of her early years, and of her relationship with her parents and siblings, her husband and her children. Shobha De's high voltage career 'happened' in unexpected ways, starting with her unplanned entry as a teenager into the glamorous world of modeling, and moving on to her high-profile years as a magazine editor. In these avatars she keenly observed and astutely chronicled the new India— brash, affluent and ambitious. High-society hi-jinks, movie star follies, celebrity neurosis— none of these escaped her unsparing eye. And now she tells it all, just as it was, just as she saw it. In her inimitably forthright fashion, she writes of the choices she made, the decisions she took and the influences that shaped her.

One Hundred Years Of Solitude, a literary masterpiece by the Nobel Laureate, is a metaphoric mirror to Colombian history. The contemplative novel drapes the tale of the rise and fall of Macondo and magically captures the life and times of the Buendia family over seven generations.  

Summary Of The Book:
Set in a fictional town called Macondo in Northern Colombia, One Hundred Years Of Solitude begins with Jose Arcadio Buendia leaving his hometown with his wife Ursula, in search of a better life. One night during their journey, they happen to camp at a riverside where Jose dreams about a spectacular city and decides to establish one on the same riverbank. Thus, he builds Macondo and slowly shapes it into how he wants a city to be. Macondo then begins to miraculously attract unusual people and extraordinary events that make for a gripping plot. The adventurous Buendias find themselves in the middle of some of the most historically potent 
circumstances in Colombia. As the lineage stands in the face of the glory and downfall of a civilization, Marquez's lyrical magic manifests the delicate nuances of love and war, youth and senility, and passion and lust. And finally, what had started as an innocent dream of Jose, Ursula and 19 other families gradually break down and fall prey to lawless anarchy. 

One Hundred Years Of Solitude also chronicles the political and economic developments of the 19th century Colombia, such as corruption and capitalism with a touch of fiction. In a deeply touching and thought provoking non-linear narrative, Marquez paints a hundred years of history on the canvas of time. He uses his prerogative of having witnessed the wave of the Colombian revolution to graphically depict its lasting influence. He arrests in prose, the magical realism surrounding life, death, peace and the truth of mankind. 

Written originally in Spanish, One Hundred Years Of Solitude was published first in 1967. It has since been translated into 37 languages and sold more than 20 million copies worldover. A recipient of global acclaim and numerous awards, the book won Marquez his Nobel Prize in 1982.

The book starts with Greg writing about how his mother is always saying that ""friends will come and go but family is forever."" Greg doesn't believe that, since his friend, Rowley, now has a girlfriend named Abigail, continuing from the events of the last book. Ever since then, Rowley has been acting different, such as refusing to hang out with Greg and agreeing with everything Abigail says.

Greg has been getting bored without Rowley, so his mother tells him to ""branch out"" and make friends with the kids in the neighborhood. He decides to become friends with Fregley, since he could ""mold him into EXACTLY the type of friend [he] need[s]."" Greg tries to get Fregley to do funny things during lunch, and Fregley then becomes popular after the other kids find out that he can ""chew"" food with his belly button.

Greg's mother announces that her extended family will come to town for Easter. Greg then writes about some of his family members, including Meemaw, who organized egg hunts in the backyard. On Easter, the family notices through a photo album that Meemaw has hidden her diamond ring in an egg, and everyone rushes out to find it, although the search is unsuccessful.

Greg decides to join an after-school activity, and with the help of a Magic 8-Ball he found on Easter, he becomes a member of the Yearbook Club. The next day, Greg accidentally drops his Magic 8-Ball, and it breaks. Greg is called to the yearbook office to take yearbook photos of Fregley (Most Popular) and Rowley and Abigail (Cutest Couple). He then resigns from his position.

Greg throws his broken Magic 8-Ball into his grandmother's yard. At school, he learns that Rowley and Abigail have broken up. Greg wonders if he and Rowley should be friends again. He goes back to the Magic 8-Ball, hoping to get ""one last good answer,"" and finds the plastic egg with Meemaw's ring. To avoid breaking up his family, he hides the egg in his mother's closet.

Greg concludes that he has to make big decisions on his own, and reconciles with Rowley. He writes, ""I know Mom's always saying that friends come and go and family is forever, and maybe that's true. [...] I'm sure me and Rowley will get in another fight somewhere down the road and then we'll go through this drama all over again. But for now, we're good.""",Diary of a Wimpy Kid : Hard Luck,Jeff Kinney, , ,Penguin Books,9780141353074,"Edition,2016",236,India,English

The God of Small Things is the debut novel of Indian writer Arundhati Roy. It is a story about the childhood experiences of fraternal twins whose lives are destroyed by the ""Love Laws"" that lay down ""who should be loved, and how. And how much."" The book explores how the small things affect people's behavior and their lives. It won the Booker Prize in 1997.

ndian history and politics shape the plot and meaning of The God of Small Things in a variety of ways. Some of Roy's commentary is on the surface, with jokes and snippets of wisdom about political realities in India. However, the novel also examines the historical roots of these realities and develops profound insights into the ways in which human desperation and desire emerge from the confines of a firmly entrenched caste society.

The story is set in the caste society of India, at a time when members of the Untouchable Paravan or Paryan caste were not permitted to touch members of higher castes or enter their houses. The Untouchables were considered polluted beings. They had the lowliest jobs and lived in subhuman conditions. In India, the caste system was considered a way to organize society. Roy's book shows how terribly cruel such a system can be.

Along with the caste system, readers see an economic class struggle. The Ipes are considered upper class. They are factory owners, the dominating class. Mammachi and Baby Kochamma would not deign to mix with those of a lower class.

However, Roy shows other types of less evident discrimination. For example, there is religious discrimination. It is unacceptable for a Syrian Christian to marry a Hindu and vice versa, and Hindus can only marry a Hindu from the same caste. In more than one passage of the book, the reader feels Rahel's and Estha's discomfort at being half Hindu. Baby Kochamma constantly makes disparaging comments about Hindus. On the other hand, there is discomfort even between Christian denominations as is shown by Pappachi's negative reaction when Baby Kochamma converts to Catholicism.

Chacko suffers more veiled racial discrimination, as it seems his daughter also does. His English wife's parents were shocked and disapproving that their daughter would marry an Indian, no matter how well educated. Sophie, at one point, mentions to her cousins that they are all ""wog,"" while she is ""half-wog.""

The Ipes are very class-conscious and feel a need to maintain their status. Discrimination is a way of protecting their privileged position in society.",The God of Small Things (Man Booker Prize 1997),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143028574,"1st Published,2002",340,India,English

The Partition in history is a record of a point in time when the country was split apart along religious lines. It is an abstract piece of history for most people. While many books have documented the Partition and the violence surrounding it, most have focused on the social and political causes, and analyzed it as a collection of abstract data. Train To Pakistan is one of the books that focuses on the human drama, the real suffering of the people caught in the middle.
Mano Majra is a village that suddenly becomes part of a border between two countries. The population of the village is predominantly Sikh and Muslim. When news of communal riots and killings reach the village, the different communities express their support for each other and swear to defend one another. However, external influences are just waiting around the corner to disturb this idyllic harmony.
A train filled with the massacred bodies of Hindus and Sikhs arrives at Mano Majra. Slowly, passions gets stoked up, especially by the influx of refugees from the newly created Pakistan. They have tales of horror to tell, and the passions of Sikhs and Hindus of the village are stirred up.
Vested interests, including that of the village magistrate’s, stir up the flames. Hindus and Sikhs who just recently swore to stand by their Muslim neighbors now turn against them. Caught in all this are Juggut Singh and Iqbal. Juggut is a criminal, while Iqbal is a western educated intellectual who is on a mission to reform society. The common thread that binds them together is that they are both thrown into jail as suspects in a murder.
Ram Lal, a local moneylender, has been murdered. Ram Lal was a Hindu and this is used by subversive elements to incite violence against Muslims. The police, in a desperate attempt to divert attention, arrest Iqbal and Juggut.

Glimpses Of World History was written by Nehru in 1934, which provides the readers a panoramic sweep of history, comprising 196 letters in total. These letters were written from a number of prisons in British India from 1930 to 1933. The sole objective of these letters was to introduce Nehru’s daughter, Indira, to world history. In his first letter, Nehru tells Indira about his sadness at being unable to send her any material gift from prison. He goes on to tell her that he would give her something he could afford, which was a series of letters, straight from his heart.

Since these letters were written during his time in prison, Nehru didn’t have access to any reference books, but only his personal notes. Through the course of this book, he covers the history of mankind from 6000 BC till the time he wrote this book. He tells the readers about the rise and fall of large civilizations and empires from Rome, Greece, West Asia, and China. He also throws light on several renowned historical figures such as Genghis Khan, Vladimir Lenin, Mohandas K. Gandhi, and Ashoka. One of his chapters talks about Genghis Khan and the Mongol invasion in a way that is against major European views of that time. He mentions that Genghis was, without doubt, history’s greatest military genius and leader, considering Alexander and Caesar petty before Genghis.

He wrote about several cultures in detail, as he wasn’t in favor of the current way history was taught at school. Owing to the fact that history teaching at school revolved only around a particular country, he wrote about world history to his daughter, to help her understand why people did what they did. These letters have been written in an informal manner, packed with contemporary as well as personal experiences.

In The Outsider (1942), his classic existentialist novel, Camus explores the alienation of an individual who refuses to conform to social norms. Meursault, his anti-hero, will not lie. When his mother dies, he refuses to show his emotions simply to satisfy the expectations of others. And when he commits a random act of violence on a sun-drenched beach near Algiers, his lack of remorse compounds his guilt in the eyes of society and the law. Yet he is as much a victim as a criminal.

Albert Camus' portrayal of a man confronting the absurd, and revolting against the injustice of society, depicts the paradox of man's joy in life when faced with the 'tender indifference' of the world.

Sandra Smith's translation, based on close listening to a recording of Camus reading his work aloud on French radio in 1954, sensitively renders the subtleties and dream-like atmosphere of L'?tranger.

Albert Camus (1913-1960), French novelist, essayist and playwright, is one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. His most famous works include The Myth of Sisyphus (1942), The Plague (1947), The Just (1949), The Rebel (1951) and The Fall (1956). He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, and his last novel, The First Man, unfinished at the time of his death, appeared in print for the first time in 1994, and was published in English soon after by Hamish Hamilton.

Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is a 2012 non-fiction book written by Susan Cain. Cain argues that modern Western culture misunderstands and undervalues the traits and capabilities of introverted people, leading to ""a colossal waste of talent, energy, and happiness"".

The book presents a history of how Western culture transformed from a culture of character to a culture of personality in which an ""extrovert ideal"" dominates and introversion is viewed as inferior or even pathological. Adopting scientific definitions of introversion and extroversion as preferences for different levels of stimulation, Quiet outlines the advantages and disadvantages of each temperament, emphasizing the myth of the extrovert ideal that has dominated in the West since the early twentieth century. Asserting that temperament is a core element of human identity, Cain cites research in biology, psychology, neuroscience and evolution to demonstrate that introversion is both common and normal, noting that many of humankind's most creative individuals and distinguished leaders were introverts. Cain urges changes at the workplace, in schools, and in parenting; offers advice to introverts for functioning in an extrovert-dominated culture; and offers advice in communication, work, and relationships between people of differing temperament.",Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can not Stop Talking,Susan Cain, , ,Penguin Books,9780307352156,"1st Edition,2013",348,Abroad,English

Love in the Time of Cholera is a celebration of life over death, love over despair, and health over sickness. It is the story of Florentino Ariza, who was rejected by Fermina Daza in his youth. He maintains a silent vigil of unrequited love for fifty-one years, nine months, and four days, until he meets Fermina again at her husband’s wake and renews his suit. The novel spans a period from the late 1870’s to the early 1930’s, and it is set in a South American community modeled after Cartagena, Colombia, and besieged by civil wars and plagues.

Florentino, an eighteen-year-old apprentice telegraph operator, sees thirteen-year old Fermina and falls madly in love. Fermina’s father finds out and sends his daughter on an extended trip to remove her from temptation. She returns years later, rejects Florentino, and accepts the proposal of a cultured physician and cholera specialist, Dr. Juvenal Urbino. Although Florentino continues to love Fermina throughout the years, he also continues his own social relationships—engaging in 622 long-term liaisons, which he records in a series of notebooks—and becomes president of a riverboat company. Then Florentino learns that eighty-one-year-old Juvenal has died, falling off a ladder trying to capture a condescending, bilingual parrot.

Darwin's theory of natural selection issued a profound challenge to orthodox thought and belief: no being or species has been specifically created; all are locked into a pitiless struggle for existence, with extinction looming for those not fitted for the task. 

Yet The Origin of Species (1859) is also a humane and inspirational vision of ecological interrelatedness, revealing the complex mutual interdependencies between animal and plant life, climate and physical environment, and - by implication - within the human world. 

Written for the general reader, in a style which combines the rigour of science with the subtlety of literature, The Origin of Species remains one of the founding documents of the modern age.",On the Origin of Species,Charles Darwin, , ,Penguin Books,9780451529060, , ,Abroad,English

Land of Two Rivers: A History of Bengal provides an incisive look into the history of Bengal, one of the most fascinating and influential regions in the Indian subcontinent. Located at the confluence of two major rivers, Ganga and Brahmaputra, Bengal has been the center of trade, learning and the arts for the longest time. In the medieval era, the rise of Muslim dynasties in Bengal brought into being a unique culture which was very different from that of northern India. The British colonization in the 18th century further transformed the social and economic structure of the region. In this book, the author traces the formation of Bengali identity through the Bengal Renaissance, the growth of nationalist politics and partition of Bengal in 1947. This book will make for an engaging and informative read for those interested in the history of Bengal.

The story unfolds on a cold April day in 1984 in Oceania, the totalitarian superpower in post World War II Europe. Winston Smith, employed as a records (no, not vinyl) editor at the Ministry of Truth, drags himself home to Victory Mansions (nothing victorious about them) for lunch. Depressed and oppressed, he starts a journal of his rebellious thoughts against the Party. If discovered, this journal will result in his execution. Now that’s playing with fire. For the sake of added precautions, Winston only writes when safe from the view of the surveying telescreens. And when that shot of industrial grade ""Victory Gin"" kicks in.

At work, Winston becomes curious about ""the brunette"" (a.k.a. Julia), a machine-operator in the Fiction Department. Although at one time he feared that she was a member of the Thought Police, all such paranoia ends when she slips him a note reading ""I love you"" in the corridor one day. The two begin a secret love affair, first meeting up in the countryside, and then in a rented room atop Mr. Charrington’s shop in the prole district. All of these places are away from surveillance – or so they think.

As Winston and Julia fall deeper in love, Winston’s views about their government (the Party) change. There’s something about Ingsoc that doesn’t seem quite right – is it the manipulation? The changing of history? The all-around sketchiness? Winston is drawn to the revolutionary ""Brotherhood"" because, well, they’re revolutionary. Eventually, Winston makes contact with O’Brien, who Winston thinks is a member of the Brotherhood, but who in actuality is a member of the Thought Police. O’Brien arranges for Winston to receive a copy of ""the book,"" a resistance manifesto which supposedly exposes the how and the why for the resistance.

Unfortunately, Winston never finds out the why. Instead, he gets tortured. But before the torturing, he and Julia are apprehended by the Thought Police. Turns out that secret hiding place wasn’t so secret after all. The happy couple is then brought to the Ministry of Love, where criminals and opponents of the Party are tortured, interrogated, and ""reintegrated"" before their release and ultimate execution. O’Brien runs the show as far as Winston’s torture sessions are concerned.

Months later, Winston is sent to Room 101, where a person is faced with his greatest fear. Rats…why did it have to be rats? Musing on the impending rats-chewing-on-his-face scenario, Winston calls out, ""Do it to Julia!"" That’s pretty much what O’Brien was looking for, so Winston gets to go back to being a happy member of the rat race. Released, Winston’s heart is filled with love for the Party. Even when he and Julia meet again by chance, they feel apathetic towards each other. The last man in Europe has been converted and destroyed. Quite the fine point there, George.

There, traditional stereotypes such as “Men have bigger brains” and women are ""naturally weak"" are countered with logic such as ""an elephant also has a bigger and heavier brain"" and “a lion is stronger than a man” and yet neither of them dominates men.[3] In Ladyland crime is eliminated, since men were considered responsible for all of it.

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.)

Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention).

We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.

Yeah, there's going to be trouble.

Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.

On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again.

Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.)

Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

Marquez's novel is very repetitive and nonlinear, so we're going to lay it down for you in a straightforward and chronological order. It's not what Marquez intended, but it sure is easier to understand.

Six months before 'the incident,' Bayardo San Román comes barging into town looking like he's the best thing since sliced bread. No one knows who he is, and the only thing they do know is that he's looking for a wife. Apparently no one in town thinks this is sketchy, so we'll roll with it too.

One day he randomly chooses Angela as his bride-to-be, despite the fact that she has no interest in him at all. His unrequited love is totally in line with his sketchy character, but everyone seems to ignore the sketch-factor because the dude's richer than Bill Gates. Anyway, Angela's lack of love for Bayardo is not the only problem. She has a secret: She's not a virgin.

Angela's impoverished family doesn't care about this fact and they basically force her into marrying Bayardo. After four months, they have the biggest wedding the town has ever seen. Everyone who's anyone (and some people who aren't even anyone) comes to the party. But it all comes crashing down on their wedding night when it's revealed that Angela is not a virgin.

Bayardo takes her back home, where Angela's mom beats her for about two hours. She tells her brothers that Santiago is the guy who deflowered her, and that's when the murder plot begins.

The next day, the town is still in a festive mood because the Bishop is supposed to visit. They even have crazy amounts of roosters prepared for his favorite cock-comb soup. So even though it's Monday, everything is not operating the way it would normally, which is unfortunate for poor Santiago.

In the hours that follow, everything that could go wrong does go wrong. It's like the darkest black comedy you've ever seen. By 6 AM everyone in town knows that the brothers are going to kill Santiago, but no one does anything. Even though the brothers don't want to kill him, no one stops them. What the heck is up with this town?

In the end, Santiago is killed at his own doorstep.

After the murder, the whole town can't stop talking about it. Angela's family leaves town and so does her husband of five hours. There's even a trial, but it doesn't seem that anything comes of it aside from some pretty cool records written in red ink.

Years later, our narrator goes around talking to the residents of the town. He tries to get some kind of truth, but we don't get anything concrete except for one sad truth: Santiago is dead.

Our lives and specifically the market are so full of random aspects and complex structures. Understanding the behaviour of markets and attributing specific reasons to its behaviour is totally impossible and sometimes a useless task. As the title explains, Taleb’s theory explains how all of us get fooled easily by randomness. Taleb goes on to elaborate how we misconstrue luck and skill. Wherever true luck plays a role, we assume it to be the work of individual skill. Most impressive situations in life are only due to luck, claims Taleb. He uses the theory of black swans (rare events) to propound his idea and says that black swans cannot be predicted.

Taleb elucidates his theory through some popular examples using people like the baseball expert Yogi Berra, the philosopher Karl Popper, the ancient wise man Solon, the financier George Soros and the Greek voyager Odysseus. Most of all, journalists and traders fall for the randomness as well. In addition to real-life examples, Taleb also brings in the case of the fictitious hero Nero, who is smart enough to understand the play of randomness in his professional life, but is superstitiously foolish.

Taleb also constructs an invincible, nameless fool who seems to be at the right place at the right time. The fool has a steady string of followers who are ready to do anything for their Guru. But, the fool’s actions cannot be imitated. His success is one obtained by chance.

The most unexpected things will happen for sure. But, we become creatures of routine that we fail to identify it when it happens. Moreover, detecting risks and accepting them is done only by the emotional part of the brain. If we understand probability, then we can perceive the role of luck in everyday situations. The trick lies in recognizing it. Taleb says we must be aware of the trap that luck sets for us.

How do we distinguish a lucky poseur from a far-sighted visionary? How do we read an incident? How do we decide whether it is luck or talent that made the person successful?

Fooled By Randomness: The Hidden Role Of Chance In The Markets And In Life received wide recognition. Fortune named it as one of the smartest books of all time and the Financial Times termed it as the Book of the Year.

Is life worth living? If life does not possess any significance when confronted with the reality of human existence, is suicide our only alternative? In the essay, Camus introduces the readers to his philosophy of the absurd where man’s futile search for meaning, unity and clarity is questioned. The author states that to realize the reason for our existence, we need to break the norms of normalcy and revolt. During the course of the book, Camus outlines numerous approaches to the absurd life. The author compares the absurdity of human life with the situation of Sisyphus, a Greek mythological figure who was condemned to forever repeat a meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain only to see it roll down again.

In a very engaging and interesting manner, the author states that humans should embrace the absurd. By embracing the absurd, it means that we accept all the unreasonable things that the world has to offer. Camus arrives at three consequences from the full acknowledgement of the absurd, revolt, freedom and passion. How then should the absurd man live? What is the purpose of life? Is suicide the answer to all the problems in life? Through a philosophical series of questioning, this book truly depicts life in a unique and refreshing manner. The book is for all those people who are interested in the philosophy of existentialism, this book will truly engage the readers till the last page.

Camus has drawn some very powerful consequences about life and mortality. Knowing the fact that one day all of us are going to die is a great liberator. Therefore traditions accepted as morals, ethics accepted as habits, all cease to be less important when we know that our time on the planet is limited. An oversimplified version of the essay is that man is only a small part of a vast and endless universe and that the most a man can do is to live their life to the fullest at every moment.

This book serves as a follow-up book to the author’s bestselling 1999 book, The Power Of Now, which promoted the idea that in order to achieve lasting happiness, human beings must learn to dissociate their thoughts from their identities. A New Earth: Create A Better Life builds extensively upon the same primary theme, exploring a different perspective this time around.

The first book had an introspective quality and focused on the spiritual needs of the individual. On the other hand, this book turns the spotlight outwards, choosing to highlight the ways in which an individual’s spiritual evolution can be instrumental in shaping humanity’s collective spiritual consciousness.

Divided into ten chapters, the book begins with a chapter on the awakening of human consciousness. The next three chapters focus on the concept of ego, exploring how attachment towards one’s thoughts, memories, and possessions can give rise to an illusory and harmful sense of self.

In the subsequent chapters, the author discusses concepts such as recurring emotional pain, the space of consciousness, and inner and outer purpose. The final chapter presents the three elements that the author considers to be collectively representative of an awakened consciousness.

A New Earth: Create A Better Life was first published in 2005 by Penguin. It went on to receive high worldwide acclaim, its popularity scaling further when it was chosen as a recommended title by Oprah Winfrey’s Book Club in 2008. This edition is a 2009 reprint by Penguin Books.

About Eckhart Tolle

Eckhart Tolle is a German-Canadian author and public speaker.

He has written books such as Guardians Of Being, A New Earth: Awakening To Your Life’s Purpose, The Power Of Now: A Guide To Spiritual Enlightenment, Oneness With All Life: Inspirational Selections from A New Earth, and Stillness Speaks: Whispers of Now.

Distinctly permeated by a highly spiritual quality, Tolle’s writing explores psychology, metaphysics, and other realms of the esoteric.

Tolle was born as Ulrich Leonard Tolle in 1948 in Germany. He had a very turbulent and disturbed childhood. With the consent of his father, he chose to study language, literature, and astronomy at home instead of attending high school. After a brief teaching stint in London, he went on to study literature, psychology, and philosophy at the University of London. After graduation, Tolle joined Cambridge University on a research scholarship. A profound inner transformation at the age of 29 saw him eventually turning into a spiritual teacher and counselor. He spreads his teachings through his company, video website, speeches, and workshops, choosing to steer clear of undue focus on commercial motivation.

The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Late Spring and Autumn Period (roughly 5th century BC). The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (""Master Sun"", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to an aspect of warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare[1] and has influenced both Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy and beyond.

This book contained a detailed explanation and analysis of the Chinese military, from weapons and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun Tzu also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Because Sun Tzu has long been considered to be one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training for centuries to come.
Chapter summary
1. Detail assessment and planning: explores the five fundamental factors (the Way, seasons, terrain, leadership, and management) and seven elements that determine the outcomes of military engagements. By thinking, assessing and comparing these points, a commander can calculate his chances of victory. Habitual deviation from these calculations will ensure failure via improper action. The text stresses that war is a very grave matter for the state and must not be commenced without due consideration.
2. Waging war : explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how success requires winning decisive engagements quickly. This section advises that successful military campaigns require limiting the cost of competition and conflict.
3. Strategic attack : defines the source of strength as unity, not size, and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war. In order of importance, these critical factors are: Attack, Strategy, Alliances, Army and Cities.
4. Disposition of the army : explains the importance of defending existing positions until a commander is capable of advancing from those positions in safety. It teaches commanders the importance of recognizing strategic opportunities, and teaches not to create opportunities for the enemy.
5. Forces : explains the use of creativity and timing in building an army's momentum.
6. Weaknesses and strengths : explains how an army's opportunities come from the openings in the environment caused by the relative weakness of the enemy and how to respond to changes in the fluid battlefield over a given area.
7. Military maneuvers : explains the dangers of direct conflict and how to win those confrontations when they are forced upon the commander.
8. Variations and adaptability : focuses on the need for flexibility in an army's responses. It explains how to respond to shifting circumstances successfully.
9. Movement and development of troops : describes the different situations in which an army finds itself as it moves through new enemy territories, and how to respond to these situations. Much of this section focuses on evaluating the intentions of others.
10. Terrain : looks at the three general areas of resistance (distance, dangers and barriers) and the six types of ground positions that arise from them. Each of these six field positions offers certain advantages and disadvantages.
11. The nine battlegrounds : describes the nine common situations (or stages) in a campaign, from scattering to deadly, and the specific focus that a commander will need in order to successfully navigate them.
12. Attacking with fire : explains the general use of weapons and the specific use of the environment as a weapon. This section examines the five targets for attack, the five types of environmental attack and the appropriate responses to such attacks.
13. Intelligence and espionage : focuses on the importance of developing good information sources, and specifies the five types of intelligence sources and how to best manage each of them.",The Art of War,Sun Tzu,John Minford, ,Penguin Books,9780140455526,"1st edition,2008",112,India,English

“Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None” is a novel by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche that was originally published in four parts between 1883 and 1891.

The novel is a philosophical treatise on Nietzsche’s ideals and his idea of the “overman”. Several of the philosopher’s most famous concepts are introduced in the novel. Including the idea that God is dead (meaning that societies old foundations are dead and that the idea of good and evil has changed) and the “eternal recurrence of the same” or the idea that time is an everlasting line and that anything that can happen has already happened and will happen again eventually.


 
Nietzsche uses the protagonist of the fifth century B.C.E. Philosopher, Zarathustra in order to tell the story. Zarathustra comes down from his mountain top cave to preach to the people about the Overman but is soon rebuked. The book is mainly comprised of Zarathustra’s lessons to the people and to himself.

Globalization has been viewed as a perfect solution for the problems of many weak and nascent economies. A globally integrated economy that allowed the free flow of capital across borders was supposed to benefit the countries that opened up their markets.

That idea has not really worked out well in many places. There is an increasing number of voices protesting against globalization policies. This book, Globalization And Its Discontents analyses the reasons for this rising opposition.

The book does not explicitly take an anti globalization stand. It just inquires into the failures of the idea in certain regions of the world. It examines the factors that contributed towards this failure. The author mainly focuses on the policies of international organizations like the IMF and the World Bank. He says that the global organizations employed a one solution fits all policy. They did not take into account the unique problems and needs of each country that they tried to help. They simply worked on the belief that a free market was the cure to all economic ills.

The author takes up the cases of South Asia and Russia to illustrate his points. He says institutions like the IMF encouraged free flow of capital even in regions without a strongly regulated financial sector. This left the field open for speculative short term investors. These investors panicked and pulled out at the slightest signs of an economic crisis. This destabilized the already weak economies of many developing countries, and whole nations went bankrupt.

The loans from IMF imposed strict conditions on the borrowing countries. These included asking the countries to cut their expenditure on public spending like food subsidies. When economies collapsed and many people lost their jobs, they did not even have a social safety net to fall back on. This led to social and political unrest in countries like Indonesia and Russia. So, the institutions that were supposed to help these countries strengthen their economies instead worsened the crisis, says the author. Globalization And Its Discontents says globalization as such is not a bad idea. It brings in global funding into poor economies and opens up new opportunities and new markets.

What is needed, says the author, are reforms in the functioning of institutions like the IMF. He says that there is need for increased transparency and accountability in these organizations.

The Metamorphosis and Other Stories, by Franz Kafka, is part of the Barnes and Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes and Noble Classics:
All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes and Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.


Virtually unknown during his lifetime, Franz Kafka is now one of the world’s most widely read and discussed authors. His nightmarish novels and short stories have come to symbolize modern man’s anxiety and alienation in a bizarre, hostile, and dehumanized world. This vision is most fully realized in Kafka’s masterpiece, “The Metamorphosis,” a story that is both harrowing and amusing, and a landmark of modern literature. 

Bringing together some of Kafka’s finest work, this collection demonstrates the richness and variety of the author’s artistry. “The Judgment,” which Kafka considered to be his decisive breakthrough, and “The Stoker,” which became the first chapter of his novel Amerika, are here included. These two, along with “The Metamorphosis,” form a suite of stories Kafka referred to as “The Sons,” and they collectively present a devastating portrait of the modern family.

Also included are “In the Penal Colony,” a story of a torture machine and its operators and victims, and “A Hunger Artist,” about the absurdity of an artist trying to communicate with a misunderstanding public. Kafka’s lucid, succinct writing chronicles the labyrinthine complexities, the futility-laden horror, and the stifling oppressiveness that permeate his vision of modern life.

Justice has multiple dimensions and cannot be defined as or decided upon in singular terms. It can mean different things to different people in different instances. It is, in simple words, understood as existing and varying on a continuum. This is the central aspect of the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen’s book, The Idea Of Justice.

This remarkable book by the distinguished economist questions the very notion of social justice being a far-fetched ideal or an achievable and practical possibility. The book defines a perfectly just society and also traces the concept of social justice as understood by philosophers and thinkers over ages. People have continued to face differences in opinions regarding what is just and what is not, and the book places special emphasis on the alternative and comparative perspectives on justice.

The author has introduced an approach to justice followed by the demands of justice, materials of justice, forms of reasoning, and public reasoning and democracy. Within the four parts the book has been divided into are chapters covering endlessly thought-provoking topics.

This book, published in 2009, is dedicated to the memory of one of Amartya Sen’s teachers, named John Rawls. Rawls wrote a book titled A Theory Of Justice, from which Sen has picked up arguments and provided a detailed evaluation of these compelling arguments. Sen has discussed the positions of justice and the situation of original position as highlighted by Rawls in his book.

This is a monumental work is a must-read for all who wish to stir their thoughts and re-think, especially in present times when the world is quivering with questions related to global justice and fairness. A masterful text, this book provides an insight into what can make societies more just rather than making it seem like an endeavour towards a mere utopian dream.",The Idea of Justice,Amartya Sen, , ,Penguin Books,9780141037851,"1st Published,2010",468,India,English

Electra portrays a young woman planning to avenge the brutal death of her father at the hands of her mother, while in Heracles the hero seeks vengeance against the evil king who has caused bloodshed in his family.

He Algebra of Infinite Justice (2001) is a collection of essays written by Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy. The book discusses several perspectives of global and local concerns, among them one being the abuse of Nuclear bomb showoffs.

The book discusses several issues from fields as diverse as the political euphoria in India over its successful nuclear bomb tests, the 'power' politics wherein she discusses the power generating companies of the world manipulating the laws and policies of the many power-deprived nations.

Introduction:

A few weeks after India detonated a thermonuclear device in 1998, Arundhati Roy wrote ‘The End of Imagination’. The essay attracted worldwide attention as the voice of a brilliant Indian writer speaking out with clarity and conscience against nuclear weapons. Over the next three and a half years, she wrote a series of political essays on a diverse range of momentous subjects: from the illusory benefits of big dams, to the downside of corporate globalization and the US Government’s war against terror. First published in 2001, The Algebra of Infinite Justice brings together all of Arundhati Roy’s political writings so far. This revised paperback edition includes two new essays, written in early 2002: ‘Democracy: Who’s She When She’s at Home’, that examines the horrific communal violence in Gujarat, and ‘War Talk: Summer Games with Nuclear Bombs’, about the threat of nuclear war in the Subcontinent.",The Algebra of Infinite Justice (Award-Winning Authors' Books),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143419280,"Edition,2017",252,India,English

An Autobiography also known as Towards The Freedom, (1936) is an autobiographical book written by the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru while he was in prison. It ran nine editions in the first year alone. He wrote the book to explore how and why he had ended up taking the path of civil disobedience that in turn led to his imprisonment.

Nehru starts his history with how his ancestors had to flee Kashmir, and then goes on to tell about his own life, with a particular emphasis on the parts of his life that had brought him to this point in time.

White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India is a tale with many levels, featuring Captain James Achilles Kirkpatrick as the protagonist. On one level, the book details the tragic romance between Kirkpatrick and Khair-un-Nissa, a Muslim noblewoman. On a different level, the story sheds light on the social, military, political, and trade aspects of 18th and 19th century India.

Captain Kirkpatrick is an ambitious soldier in the East India Company. When his eyes settle upon the beautiful Khair, the Nizam’s great-niece, the course of his life takes a new direction. Kirkpatrick soon learns that he must overcome many obstacles in order to marry Khair. Firstly, she is locked in purdah and engaged to be married to a nobleman. Secondly, as a Resident, Kirkpatrick is obligated to convert to Islam, which he hopes will make it easier for him to marry Khair. Kirkpatrick also ends up working as a double-agent, while working for the East India Company, he is actually supporting the Hyderabadis.

Apart from this love story, Dalrymple, also presents a side of history which is virtually unexplored by historians. Through memorable characters such as Hindoo Stuart and Sir David Ochterlony, the author draws readers’ attention to the concept of “white Mughals”. These are people of British descent who had adopted Indian customs, traditions, but who were also a source of embarrassment for colonial administrations. After conducting over five years of research, the author portrays a fascinating portrait about social etiquette, sexual and dismissive attitudes, and the growing racist treatment by the ruling British class towards the offspring of mixed race couples.
White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India won the 2003 Scottish Book Of the Year. In 2011, Dalrymple announced that British actor Ralph Fiennes would act and direct the movie-version of book.

Emraan Hashmi is not just a charming face or an unconventional actor. He is not just bold in his character portrayals. Hashmi, or Emmi as his family members call him, is also a father who is level-headed, unfazed and unyielding.

The Kiss of Life is about that time in Hashmi's life when his son needed him the most, the time when all his other experiences paled in comparison to the tennis ball tumour that invaded his son's kidney.

The chapters alternate between the present - the hospital wards, chemo and the shivers - and the past, where Hashmi battles his own doubts of being an actor, the ups and downs in his career, the media branding him as a serial kisser, the typecasting and so on.

Hashmi's book also has extensive research material on cancer. He talks about guidelines, a nutrition plan, hospital procedures and the will power to fight the C monster.",The Kiss of Life (How a Superhero and My Son Defeated Cancer),"Emraan Hashmi,Bilal Siddiqi", , ,Penguin Books,9780143426509,"1st Edition,2016",185,India,English

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.) 
Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention). 
We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.
Yeah, there's going to be trouble. Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.
On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again. 
Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.) 
Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

“The Starry Night” shows Sexton’s identification with another tortured and suicidal artist, Vincent van Gogh. The short, free-verse poem begins with an epigraph from one of van Gogh’s letters to his brother. “That does not keep me from having a terrible need of—shall I say the word—religion,” van Gogh wrote. “Then I go out at night to paint the stars.” Sexton used epigraphs from a variety of works to begin her poems, and the epigraphs are often of major importance, pointing to a main theme of the poem that might otherwise be overlooked. Here she is indicating that she shares not only the mental imbalance, suicidal tendencies, and artistic nature of the Dutch artist but also his unsatisfied desire for the spiritual.

When van Gogh wrote the letter to his brother, he was painting the masterpiece Starry Night on the Rhone, which is described in the poem. The painting captures the night sky in blues and blacks, with a swirl of violent orange representing the moon, and burning yellow-white stars. One would expect a peaceful scene from the title, but this painting is intensely disquieting. The movement seems to be a great rush skyward, the sleeping town beneath the sky unconscious of this spiraling of all nature toward infinity. Sexton sees this painting as a reflection of her own death wish. The dark tree at the edge of the painting is described as “black-haired”—Sexton was a brunette—and it “slips/ up like a drowned woman into the hot sky.” To make her meaning clearer, she continues, “This is how/ I want to die.”

The poem interprets the painting as presenting a nature that is animate and hostile. Nevertheless, the picture attracts the speaker, because nature’s brute force promises death, release from the burden of self. Sexton sees the central moon image in the painting as a great dragon that will suck her up into its being. She desires, she says, “to split/ from my life with no flag,/ no belly,/ no cry”—to merge silently and painlessly with the infinite. The images may suggest not a rediscovery of religion but a terrifying substitute for it. Part of the appeal of this poem lies in the vivid interpretation of the painting and in the kinship the reader sees between Sexton and van Gogh.",Starry Nights,Shobhaa De, , ,Penguin Books,9780143421313,"1st Edition,2013",315,India,English

Insiders know that besides her commitment to work and the frantic pace of her life, Shobhaa Dé's first priority in life has always been her family. Here she writes poignantly of her early years, and of her relationship with her parents and siblings, her husband and her children. Shobha De's high voltage career 'happened' in unexpected ways, starting with her unplanned entry as a teenager into the glamorous world of modeling, and moving on to her high-profile years as a magazine editor. In these avatars she keenly observed and astutely chronicled the new India— brash, affluent and ambitious. High-society hi-jinks, movie star follies, celebrity neurosis— none of these escaped her unsparing eye. And now she tells it all, just as it was, just as she saw it. In her inimitably forthright fashion, she writes of the choices she made, the decisions she took and the influences that shaped her.

One Hundred Years Of Solitude, a literary masterpiece by the Nobel Laureate, is a metaphoric mirror to Colombian history. The contemplative novel drapes the tale of the rise and fall of Macondo and magically captures the life and times of the Buendia family over seven generations.  

Summary Of The Book:
Set in a fictional town called Macondo in Northern Colombia, One Hundred Years Of Solitude begins with Jose Arcadio Buendia leaving his hometown with his wife Ursula, in search of a better life. One night during their journey, they happen to camp at a riverside where Jose dreams about a spectacular city and decides to establish one on the same riverbank. Thus, he builds Macondo and slowly shapes it into how he wants a city to be. Macondo then begins to miraculously attract unusual people and extraordinary events that make for a gripping plot. The adventurous Buendias find themselves in the middle of some of the most historically potent 
circumstances in Colombia. As the lineage stands in the face of the glory and downfall of a civilization, Marquez's lyrical magic manifests the delicate nuances of love and war, youth and senility, and passion and lust. And finally, what had started as an innocent dream of Jose, Ursula and 19 other families gradually break down and fall prey to lawless anarchy. 

One Hundred Years Of Solitude also chronicles the political and economic developments of the 19th century Colombia, such as corruption and capitalism with a touch of fiction. In a deeply touching and thought provoking non-linear narrative, Marquez paints a hundred years of history on the canvas of time. He uses his prerogative of having witnessed the wave of the Colombian revolution to graphically depict its lasting influence. He arrests in prose, the magical realism surrounding life, death, peace and the truth of mankind. 

Written originally in Spanish, One Hundred Years Of Solitude was published first in 1967. It has since been translated into 37 languages and sold more than 20 million copies worldover. A recipient of global acclaim and numerous awards, the book won Marquez his Nobel Prize in 1982.

The book starts with Greg writing about how his mother is always saying that ""friends will come and go but family is forever."" Greg doesn't believe that, since his friend, Rowley, now has a girlfriend named Abigail, continuing from the events of the last book. Ever since then, Rowley has been acting different, such as refusing to hang out with Greg and agreeing with everything Abigail says.

Greg has been getting bored without Rowley, so his mother tells him to ""branch out"" and make friends with the kids in the neighborhood. He decides to become friends with Fregley, since he could ""mold him into EXACTLY the type of friend [he] need[s]."" Greg tries to get Fregley to do funny things during lunch, and Fregley then becomes popular after the other kids find out that he can ""chew"" food with his belly button.

Greg's mother announces that her extended family will come to town for Easter. Greg then writes about some of his family members, including Meemaw, who organized egg hunts in the backyard. On Easter, the family notices through a photo album that Meemaw has hidden her diamond ring in an egg, and everyone rushes out to find it, although the search is unsuccessful.

Greg decides to join an after-school activity, and with the help of a Magic 8-Ball he found on Easter, he becomes a member of the Yearbook Club. The next day, Greg accidentally drops his Magic 8-Ball, and it breaks. Greg is called to the yearbook office to take yearbook photos of Fregley (Most Popular) and Rowley and Abigail (Cutest Couple). He then resigns from his position.

Greg throws his broken Magic 8-Ball into his grandmother's yard. At school, he learns that Rowley and Abigail have broken up. Greg wonders if he and Rowley should be friends again. He goes back to the Magic 8-Ball, hoping to get ""one last good answer,"" and finds the plastic egg with Meemaw's ring. To avoid breaking up his family, he hides the egg in his mother's closet.

Greg concludes that he has to make big decisions on his own, and reconciles with Rowley. He writes, ""I know Mom's always saying that friends come and go and family is forever, and maybe that's true. [...] I'm sure me and Rowley will get in another fight somewhere down the road and then we'll go through this drama all over again. But for now, we're good.""",Diary of a Wimpy Kid : Hard Luck,Jeff Kinney, , ,Penguin Books,9780141353074,"Edition,2016",236,India,English

The God of Small Things is the debut novel of Indian writer Arundhati Roy. It is a story about the childhood experiences of fraternal twins whose lives are destroyed by the ""Love Laws"" that lay down ""who should be loved, and how. And how much."" The book explores how the small things affect people's behavior and their lives. It won the Booker Prize in 1997.

ndian history and politics shape the plot and meaning of The God of Small Things in a variety of ways. Some of Roy's commentary is on the surface, with jokes and snippets of wisdom about political realities in India. However, the novel also examines the historical roots of these realities and develops profound insights into the ways in which human desperation and desire emerge from the confines of a firmly entrenched caste society.

The story is set in the caste society of India, at a time when members of the Untouchable Paravan or Paryan caste were not permitted to touch members of higher castes or enter their houses. The Untouchables were considered polluted beings. They had the lowliest jobs and lived in subhuman conditions. In India, the caste system was considered a way to organize society. Roy's book shows how terribly cruel such a system can be.

Along with the caste system, readers see an economic class struggle. The Ipes are considered upper class. They are factory owners, the dominating class. Mammachi and Baby Kochamma would not deign to mix with those of a lower class.

However, Roy shows other types of less evident discrimination. For example, there is religious discrimination. It is unacceptable for a Syrian Christian to marry a Hindu and vice versa, and Hindus can only marry a Hindu from the same caste. In more than one passage of the book, the reader feels Rahel's and Estha's discomfort at being half Hindu. Baby Kochamma constantly makes disparaging comments about Hindus. On the other hand, there is discomfort even between Christian denominations as is shown by Pappachi's negative reaction when Baby Kochamma converts to Catholicism.

Chacko suffers more veiled racial discrimination, as it seems his daughter also does. His English wife's parents were shocked and disapproving that their daughter would marry an Indian, no matter how well educated. Sophie, at one point, mentions to her cousins that they are all ""wog,"" while she is ""half-wog.""

The Ipes are very class-conscious and feel a need to maintain their status. Discrimination is a way of protecting their privileged position in society.",The God of Small Things (Man Booker Prize 1997),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143028574,"1st Published,2002",340,India,English

The Partition in history is a record of a point in time when the country was split apart along religious lines. It is an abstract piece of history for most people. While many books have documented the Partition and the violence surrounding it, most have focused on the social and political causes, and analyzed it as a collection of abstract data. Train To Pakistan is one of the books that focuses on the human drama, the real suffering of the people caught in the middle.
Mano Majra is a village that suddenly becomes part of a border between two countries. The population of the village is predominantly Sikh and Muslim. When news of communal riots and killings reach the village, the different communities express their support for each other and swear to defend one another. However, external influences are just waiting around the corner to disturb this idyllic harmony.
A train filled with the massacred bodies of Hindus and Sikhs arrives at Mano Majra. Slowly, passions gets stoked up, especially by the influx of refugees from the newly created Pakistan. They have tales of horror to tell, and the passions of Sikhs and Hindus of the village are stirred up.
Vested interests, including that of the village magistrate’s, stir up the flames. Hindus and Sikhs who just recently swore to stand by their Muslim neighbors now turn against them. Caught in all this are Juggut Singh and Iqbal. Juggut is a criminal, while Iqbal is a western educated intellectual who is on a mission to reform society. The common thread that binds them together is that they are both thrown into jail as suspects in a murder.
Ram Lal, a local moneylender, has been murdered. Ram Lal was a Hindu and this is used by subversive elements to incite violence against Muslims. The police, in a desperate attempt to divert attention, arrest Iqbal and Juggut.
Meanwhile, as the violence escalates, a train arrives to take the Muslim population of the village en masse to Pakistan.

Glimpses Of World History was written by Nehru in 1934, which provides the readers a panoramic sweep of history, comprising 196 letters in total. These letters were written from a number of prisons in British India from 1930 to 1933. The sole objective of these letters was to introduce Nehru’s daughter, Indira, to world history. In his first letter, Nehru tells Indira about his sadness at being unable to send her any material gift from prison. He goes on to tell her that he would give her something he could afford, which was a series of letters, straight from his heart.

Since these letters were written during his time in prison, Nehru didn’t have access to any reference books, but only his personal notes. Through the course of this book, he covers the history of mankind from 6000 BC till the time he wrote this book. He tells the readers about the rise and fall of large civilizations and empires from Rome, Greece, West Asia, and China. He also throws light on several renowned historical figures such as Genghis Khan, Vladimir Lenin, Mohandas K. Gandhi, and Ashoka. One of his chapters talks about Genghis Khan and the Mongol invasion in a way that is against major European views of that time. He mentions that Genghis was, without doubt, history’s greatest military genius and leader, considering Alexander and Caesar petty before Genghis.

He wrote about several cultures in detail, as he wasn’t in favor of the current way history was taught at school. Owing to the fact that history teaching at school revolved only around a particular country, he wrote about world history to his daughter, to help her understand why people did what they did. These letters have been written in an informal manner, packed with contemporary as well as personal experiences.

In The Outsider (1942), his classic existentialist novel, Camus explores the alienation of an individual who refuses to conform to social norms. Meursault, his anti-hero, will not lie. When his mother dies, he refuses to show his emotions simply to satisfy the expectations of others. And when he commits a random act of violence on a sun-drenched beach near Algiers, his lack of remorse compounds his guilt in the eyes of society and the law. Yet he is as much a victim as a criminal.

Albert Camus' portrayal of a man confronting the absurd, and revolting against the injustice of society, depicts the paradox of man's joy in life when faced with the 'tender indifference' of the world.

Sandra Smith's translation, based on close listening to a recording of Camus reading his work aloud on French radio in 1954, sensitively renders the subtleties and dream-like atmosphere of L'?tranger.

Albert Camus (1913-1960), French novelist, essayist and playwright, is one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. His most famous works include The Myth of Sisyphus (1942), The Plague (1947), The Just (1949), The Rebel (1951) and The Fall (1956). He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, and his last novel, The First Man, unfinished at the time of his death, appeared in print for the first time in 1994, and was published in English soon after by Hamish Hamilton.

Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is a 2012 non-fiction book written by Susan Cain. Cain argues that modern Western culture misunderstands and undervalues the traits and capabilities of introverted people, leading to ""a colossal waste of talent, energy, and happiness"".

The book presents a history of how Western culture transformed from a culture of character to a culture of personality in which an ""extrovert ideal"" dominates and introversion is viewed as inferior or even pathological. Adopting scientific definitions of introversion and extroversion as preferences for different levels of stimulation, Quiet outlines the advantages and disadvantages of each temperament, emphasizing the myth of the extrovert ideal that has dominated in the West since the early twentieth century. Asserting that temperament is a core element of human identity, Cain cites research in biology, psychology, neuroscience and evolution to demonstrate that introversion is both common and normal, noting that many of humankind's most creative individuals and distinguished leaders were introverts. Cain urges changes at the workplace, in schools, and in parenting; offers advice to introverts for functioning in an extrovert-dominated culture; and offers advice in communication, work, and relationships between people of differing temperament.",Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can not Stop Talking,Susan Cain, , ,Penguin Books,9780307352156,"1st Edition,2013",348,Abroad,English

Love in the Time of Cholera is a celebration of life over death, love over despair, and health over sickness. It is the story of Florentino Ariza, who was rejected by Fermina Daza in his youth. He maintains a silent vigil of unrequited love for fifty-one years, nine months, and four days, until he meets Fermina again at her husband’s wake and renews his suit. The novel spans a period from the late 1870’s to the early 1930’s, and it is set in a South American community modeled after Cartagena, Colombia, and besieged by civil wars and plagues.

Florentino, an eighteen-year-old apprentice telegraph operator, sees thirteen-year old Fermina and falls madly in love. Fermina’s father finds out and sends his daughter on an extended trip to remove her from temptation. She returns years later, rejects Florentino, and accepts the proposal of a cultured physician and cholera specialist, Dr. Juvenal Urbino. Although Florentino continues to love Fermina throughout the years, he also continues his own social relationships—engaging in 622 long-term liaisons, which he records in a series of notebooks—and becomes president of a riverboat company.

The story unfolds on a cold April day in 1984 in Oceania, the totalitarian superpower in post World War II Europe. Winston Smith, employed as a records (no, not vinyl) editor at the Ministry of Truth, drags himself home to Victory Mansions (nothing victorious about them) for lunch. Depressed and oppressed, he starts a journal of his rebellious thoughts against the Party. If discovered, this journal will result in his execution. Now that’s playing with fire. For the sake of added precautions, Winston only writes when safe from the view of the surveying telescreens. And when that shot of industrial grade ""Victory Gin"" kicks in.

At work, Winston becomes curious about ""the brunette"" (a.k.a. Julia), a machine-operator in the Fiction Department. Although at one time he feared that she was a member of the Thought Police, all such paranoia ends when she slips him a note reading ""I love you"" in the corridor one day. The two begin a secret love affair, first meeting up in the countryside, and then in a rented room atop Mr. Charrington’s shop in the prole district. All of these places are away from surveillance – or so they think.

As Winston and Julia fall deeper in love, Winston’s views about their government (the Party) change. There’s something about Ingsoc that doesn’t seem quite right – is it the manipulation? The changing of history? The all-around sketchiness? Winston is drawn to the revolutionary ""Brotherhood"" because, well, they’re revolutionary. Eventually, Winston makes contact with O’Brien, who Winston thinks is a member of the Brotherhood, but who in actuality is a member of the Thought Police. O’Brien arranges for Winston to receive a copy of ""the book,"" a resistance manifesto which supposedly exposes the how and the why for the resistance.

Unfortunately, Winston never finds out the why. Instead, he gets tortured. But before the torturing, he and Julia are apprehended by the Thought Police. Turns out that secret hiding place wasn’t so secret after all. The happy couple is then brought to the Ministry of Love, where criminals and opponents of the Party are tortured, interrogated, and ""reintegrated"" before their release and ultimate execution. O’Brien runs the show as far as Winston’s torture sessions are concerned.

It depicts a feminist utopia (called Ladyland) in which women run everything and men are secluded, in a mirror-image of the traditional practice of purdah. The women are aided by science fiction-esque ""electrical"" technology which enables laborless farming and flying cars; the women scientists have discovered how to trap solar power and control the weather. This results in ""a sort of gender-based Planet of the Apes where the roles are reversed and the men are locked away in a technologically advanced future.

There, traditional stereotypes such as “Men have bigger brains” and women are ""naturally weak"" are countered with logic such as ""an elephant also has a bigger and heavier brain"" and “a lion is stronger than a man” and yet neither of them dominates men.[3] In Ladyland crime is eliminated, since men were considered responsible for all of it. The workday is only two hours long, since men used to waste six hours of each day in smoking. The religion is one of love and truth.

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.)

Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention).

We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.

Yeah, there's going to be trouble.

Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.

On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again.

Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.)

Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

Marquez's novel is very repetitive and nonlinear, so we're going to lay it down for you in a straightforward and chronological order. It's not what Marquez intended, but it sure is easier to understand.

Six months before 'the incident,' Bayardo San Román comes barging into town looking like he's the best thing since sliced bread. No one knows who he is, and the only thing they do know is that he's looking for a wife. Apparently no one in town thinks this is sketchy, so we'll roll with it too.

One day he randomly chooses Angela as his bride-to-be, despite the fact that she has no interest in him at all. His unrequited love is totally in line with his sketchy character, but everyone seems to ignore the sketch-factor because the dude's richer than Bill Gates. Anyway, Angela's lack of love for Bayardo is not the only problem. She has a secret: She's not a virgin.

Angela's impoverished family doesn't care about this fact and they basically force her into marrying Bayardo. After four months, they have the biggest wedding the town has ever seen. Everyone who's anyone (and some people who aren't even anyone) comes to the party. But it all comes crashing down on their wedding night when it's revealed that Angela is not a virgin.

Bayardo takes her back home, where Angela's mom beats her for about two hours. She tells her brothers that Santiago is the guy who deflowered her, and that's when the murder plot begins.

The next day, the town is still in a festive mood because the Bishop is supposed to visit. They even have crazy amounts of roosters prepared for his favorite cock-comb soup. So even though it's Monday, everything is not operating the way it would normally, which is unfortunate for poor Santiago.

In the hours that follow, everything that could go wrong does go wrong. It's like the darkest black comedy you've ever seen. By 6 AM everyone in town knows that the brothers are going to kill Santiago, but no one does anything. Even though the brothers don't want to kill him, no one stops them. What the heck is up with this town?

In the end, Santiago is killed at his own doorstep.

After the murder, the whole town can't stop talking about it. Angela's family leaves town and so does her husband of five hours. There's even a trial, but it doesn't seem that anything comes of it aside from some pretty cool records written in red ink.

Years later, our narrator goes around talking to the residents of the town. He tries to get some kind of truth, but we don't get anything concrete except for one sad truth: Santiago is dead.

Our lives and specifically the market are so full of random aspects and complex structures. Understanding the behaviour of markets and attributing specific reasons to its behaviour is totally impossible and sometimes a useless task. As the title explains, Taleb’s theory explains how all of us get fooled easily by randomness. Taleb goes on to elaborate how we misconstrue luck and skill. Wherever true luck plays a role, we assume it to be the work of individual skill. Most impressive situations in life are only due to luck, claims Taleb. He uses the theory of black swans (rare events) to propound his idea and says that black swans cannot be predicted.

Taleb elucidates his theory through some popular examples using people like the baseball expert Yogi Berra, the philosopher Karl Popper, the ancient wise man Solon, the financier George Soros and the Greek voyager Odysseus. Most of all, journalists and traders fall for the randomness as well. In addition to real-life examples, Taleb also brings in the case of the fictitious hero Nero, who is smart enough to understand the play of randomness in his professional life, but is superstitiously foolish.

Taleb also constructs an invincible, nameless fool who seems to be at the right place at the right time. The fool has a steady string of followers who are ready to do anything for their Guru. But, the fool’s actions cannot be imitated. His success is one obtained by chance.

The most unexpected things will happen for sure. But, we become creatures of routine that we fail to identify it when it happens. Moreover, detecting risks and accepting them is done only by the emotional part of the brain. If we understand probability, then we can perceive the role of luck in everyday situations. The trick lies in recognizing it. Taleb says we must be aware of the trap that luck sets for us.

How do we distinguish a lucky poseur from a far-sighted visionary? How do we read an incident? How do we decide whether it is luck or talent that made the person successful?

Fooled By Randomness: The Hidden Role Of Chance In The Markets And In Life received wide recognition. Fortune named it as one of the smartest books of all time and the Financial Times termed it as the Book of the Year.

Is life worth living? If life does not possess any significance when confronted with the reality of human existence, is suicide our only alternative? In the essay, Camus introduces the readers to his philosophy of the absurd where man’s futile search for meaning, unity and clarity is questioned. The author states that to realize the reason for our existence, we need to break the norms of normalcy and revolt. During the course of the book, Camus outlines numerous approaches to the absurd life. The author compares the absurdity of human life with the situation of Sisyphus, a Greek mythological figure who was condemned to forever repeat a meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain only to see it roll down again.

In a very engaging and interesting manner, the author states that humans should embrace the absurd. By embracing the absurd, it means that we accept all the unreasonable things that the world has to offer. Camus arrives at three consequences from the full acknowledgement of the absurd, revolt, freedom and passion. How then should the absurd man live? What is the purpose of life? Is suicide the answer to all the problems in life? Through a philosophical series of questioning, this book truly depicts life in a unique and refreshing manner. The book is for all those people who are interested in the philosophy of existentialism, this book will truly engage the readers till the last page.

Camus has drawn some very powerful consequences about life and mortality. Knowing the fact that one day all of us are going to die is a great liberator. Therefore traditions accepted as morals, ethics accepted as habits, all cease to be less important when we know that our time on the planet is limited. An oversimplified version of the essay is that man is only a small part of a vast and endless universe and that the most a man can do is to live their life to the fullest at every moment.

The story unfolds on a cold April day in 1984 in Oceania, the totalitarian superpower in post World War II Europe. Winston Smith, employed as a records (no, not vinyl) editor at the Ministry of Truth, drags himself home to Victory Mansions (nothing victorious about them) for lunch. Depressed and oppressed, he starts a journal of his rebellious thoughts against the Party. If discovered, this journal will result in his execution. Now that’s playing with fire. For the sake of added precautions, Winston only writes when safe from the view of the surveying telescreens. And when that shot of industrial grade ""Victory Gin"" kicks in.
At work, Winston becomes curious about ""the brunette"" (a.k.a. Julia), a machine-operator in the Fiction Department. Although at one time he feared that she was a member of the Thought Police, all such paranoia ends when she slips him a note reading ""I love you"" in the corridor one day. The two begin a secret love affair, first meeting up in the countryside, and then in a rented room atop Mr. Charrington’s shop in the prole district. All of these places are away from surveillance – or so they think. 
As Winston and Julia fall deeper in love, Winston’s views about their government (the Party) change. There’s something about Ingsoc that doesn’t seem quite right – is it the manipulation? The changing of history? The all-around sketchiness? Winston is drawn to the revolutionary ""Brotherhood"" because, well, they’re revolutionary. Eventually, Winston makes contact with O’Brien, who Winston thinks is a member of the Brotherhood, but who in actuality is a member of the Thought Police. O’Brien arranges for Winston to receive a copy of ""the book,"" a resistance manifesto which supposedly exposes the how and the why for the resistance. 
Unfortunately, Winston never finds out the why. Instead, he gets tortured. But before the torturing, he and Julia are apprehended by the Thought Police. Turns out that secret hiding place wasn’t so secret after all. The happy couple is then brought to the Ministry of Love, where criminals and opponents of the Party are tortured, interrogated, and ""reintegrated"" before their release and ultimate execution. O’Brien runs the show as far as Winston’s torture sessions are concerned. 
Months later, Winston is sent to Room 101, where a person is faced with his greatest fear. Rats…why did it have to be rats?

This book serves as a follow-up book to the author’s bestselling 1999 book, The Power Of Now, which promoted the idea that in order to achieve lasting happiness, human beings must learn to dissociate their thoughts from their identities. A New Earth: Create A Better Life builds extensively upon the same primary theme, exploring a different perspective this time around.

The first book had an introspective quality and focused on the spiritual needs of the individual. On the other hand, this book turns the spotlight outwards, choosing to highlight the ways in which an individual’s spiritual evolution can be instrumental in shaping humanity’s collective spiritual consciousness.

Divided into ten chapters, the book begins with a chapter on the awakening of human consciousness. The next three chapters focus on the concept of ego, exploring how attachment towards one’s thoughts, memories, and possessions can give rise to an illusory and harmful sense of self.

In the subsequent chapters, the author discusses concepts such as recurring emotional pain, the space of consciousness, and inner and outer purpose. The final chapter presents the three elements that the author considers to be collectively representative of an awakened consciousness.

A New Earth: Create A Better Life was first published in 2005 by Penguin. It went on to receive high worldwide acclaim, its popularity scaling further when it was chosen as a recommended title by Oprah Winfrey’s Book Club in 2008. This edition is a 2009 reprint by Penguin Books.

The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Late Spring and Autumn Period (roughly 5th century BC). The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (""Master Sun"", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to an aspect of warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare[1] and has influenced both Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy and beyond.

This book contained a detailed explanation and analysis of the Chinese military, from weapons and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun Tzu also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Because Sun Tzu has long been considered to be one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training for centuries to come.
Chapter summary
1. Detail assessment and planning: explores the five fundamental factors (the Way, seasons, terrain, leadership, and management) and seven elements that determine the outcomes of military engagements. By thinking, assessing and comparing these points, a commander can calculate his chances of victory. Habitual deviation from these calculations will ensure failure via improper action. The text stresses that war is a very grave matter for the state and must not be commenced without due consideration.
2. Waging war : explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how success requires winning decisive engagements quickly. This section advises that successful military campaigns require limiting the cost of competition and conflict.
3. Strategic attack : defines the source of strength as unity, not size, and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war. In order of importance, these critical factors are: Attack, Strategy, Alliances, Army and Cities.
4. Disposition of the army : explains the importance of defending existing positions until a commander is capable of advancing from those positions in safety. It teaches commanders the importance of recognizing strategic opportunities, and teaches not to create opportunities for the enemy.
5. Forces : explains the use of creativity and timing in building an army's momentum.
6. Weaknesses and strengths : explains how an army's opportunities come from the openings in the environment caused by the relative weakness of the enemy and how to respond to changes in the fluid battlefield over a given area.
7. Military maneuvers : explains the dangers of direct conflict and how to win those confrontations when they are forced upon the commander.
8. Variations and adaptability : focuses on the need for flexibility in an army's responses. It explains how to respond to shifting circumstances successfully.
9. Movement and development of troops : describes the different situations in which an army finds itself as it moves through new enemy territories, and how to respond to these situations. Much of this section focuses on evaluating the intentions of others.
10. Terrain : looks at the three general areas of resistance (distance, dangers and barriers) and the six types of ground positions that arise from them. Each of these six field positions offers certain advantages and disadvantages.
11. The nine battlegrounds : describes the nine common situations (or stages) in a campaign, from scattering to deadly, and the specific focus that a commander will need in order to successfully navigate them.
12. Attacking with fire : explains the general use of weapons and the specific use of the environment as a weapon. This section examines the five targets for attack, the five types of environmental attack and the appropriate responses to such attacks.
13. Intelligence and espionage : focuses on the importance of developing good information sources, and specifies the five types of intelligence sources and how to best manage each of them.",The Art of War,Sun Tzu,John Minford, ,Penguin Books,9780140455526,"1st edition,2008",112,India,English

“Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None” is a novel by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche that was originally published in four parts between 1883 and 1891.

The novel is a philosophical treatise on Nietzsche’s ideals and his idea of the “overman”. Several of the philosopher’s most famous concepts are introduced in the novel. Including the idea that God is dead (meaning that societies old foundations are dead and that the idea of good and evil has changed) and the “eternal recurrence of the same” or the idea that time is an everlasting line and that anything that can happen has already happened and will happen again eventually.


 
Nietzsche uses the protagonist of the fifth century B.C.E. Philosopher, Zarathustra in order to tell the story. Zarathustra comes down from his mountain top cave to preach to the people about the Overman but is soon rebuked. The book is mainly comprised of Zarathustra’s lessons to the people and to himself. In the end, he battles his final sin: pity and sees a sign that the overman is coming.",Thus Spoke Zarathustra (Penguin Classics),Friedrich Nietzsche, , ,Penguin Books,9789380005553,"second edition,2014",416,India,English
Globalization and its Discontent,জোসেফ ই. স্টিগলিটজ্,TK. 718,"",https://rokomari.com//book/84828/globalization-and-its-discontent,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/d5cbebd6b_84828.jpg,"Summary Of The Book

Globalization has been viewed as a perfect solution for the problems of many weak and nascent economies. A globally integrated economy that allowed the free flow of capital across borders was supposed to benefit the countries that opened up their markets.

That idea has not really worked out well in many places. There is an increasing number of voices protesting against globalization policies. This book, Globalization And Its Discontents analyses the reasons for this rising opposition.

The book does not explicitly take an anti globalization stand. It just inquires into the failures of the idea in certain regions of the world. It examines the factors that contributed towards this failure. The author mainly focuses on the policies of international organizations like the IMF and the World Bank. He says that the global organizations employed a one solution fits all policy. They did not take into account the unique problems and needs of each country that they tried to help. They simply worked on the belief that a free market was the cure to all economic ills.

The author takes up the cases of South Asia and Russia to illustrate his points. He says institutions like the IMF encouraged free flow of capital even in regions without a strongly regulated financial sector. This left the field open for speculative short term investors. These investors panicked and pulled out at the slightest signs of an economic crisis. This destabilized the already weak economies of many developing countries, and whole nations went bankrupt.

The loans from IMF imposed strict conditions on the borrowing countries. These included asking the countries to cut their expenditure on public spending like food subsidies. When economies collapsed and many people lost their jobs, they did not even have a social safety net to fall back on. This led to social and political unrest in countries like Indonesia and Russia. So, the institutions that were supposed to help these countries strengthen their economies instead worsened the crisis, says the author. Globalization And Its Discontents says globalization as such is not a bad idea. It brings in global funding into poor economies and opens up new opportunities and new markets.

What is needed, says the author, are reforms in the functioning of institutions like the IMF. He says that there is need for increased transparency and accountability in these organizations.

The Metamorphosis and Other Stories, by Franz Kafka, is part of the Barnes and Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes and Noble Classics:
All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes and Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.


Virtually unknown during his lifetime, Franz Kafka is now one of the world’s most widely read and discussed authors. His nightmarish novels and short stories have come to symbolize modern man’s anxiety and alienation in a bizarre, hostile, and dehumanized world. This vision is most fully realized in Kafka’s masterpiece, “The Metamorphosis,” a story that is both harrowing and amusing, and a landmark of modern literature. 

Bringing together some of Kafka’s finest work, this collection demonstrates the richness and variety of the author’s artistry. “The Judgment,” which Kafka considered to be his decisive breakthrough, and “The Stoker,” which became the first chapter of his novel Amerika, are here included. These two, along with “The Metamorphosis,” form a suite of stories Kafka referred to as “The Sons,” and they collectively present a devastating portrait of the modern family.

Also included are “In the Penal Colony,” a story of a torture machine and its operators and victims, and “A Hunger Artist,” about the absurdity of an artist trying to communicate with a misunderstanding public. Kafka’s lucid, succinct writing chronicles the labyrinthine complexities, the futility-laden horror, and the stifling oppressiveness that permeate his vision of modern life.

Justice has multiple dimensions and cannot be defined as or decided upon in singular terms. It can mean different things to different people in different instances. It is, in simple words, understood as existing and varying on a continuum. This is the central aspect of the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen’s book, The Idea Of Justice.

This remarkable book by the distinguished economist questions the very notion of social justice being a far-fetched ideal or an achievable and practical possibility. The book defines a perfectly just society and also traces the concept of social justice as understood by philosophers and thinkers over ages. People have continued to face differences in opinions regarding what is just and what is not, and the book places special emphasis on the alternative and comparative perspectives on justice.

The author has introduced an approach to justice followed by the demands of justice, materials of justice, forms of reasoning, and public reasoning and democracy. Within the four parts the book has been divided into are chapters covering endlessly thought-provoking topics.

This book, published in 2009, is dedicated to the memory of one of Amartya Sen’s teachers, named John Rawls. Rawls wrote a book titled A Theory Of Justice, from which Sen has picked up arguments and provided a detailed evaluation of these compelling arguments. Sen has discussed the positions of justice and the situation of original position as highlighted by Rawls in his book.

This is a monumental work is a must-read for all who wish to stir their thoughts and re-think, especially in present times when the world is quivering with questions related to global justice and fairness. A masterful text, this book provides an insight into what can make societies more just rather than making it seem like an endeavour towards a mere utopian dream.",The Idea of Justice,Amartya Sen, , ,Penguin Books,9780141037851,"1st Published,2010",468,India,English

The first playwright to depict suffering without reference to the gods, Euripides (484-407 BC) made his characters speak in human terms and face the consequences of their actions. In Medea, a woman rejected by her lover takes hideous revenge by murdering the children they both love, and Hecabe depicts the former queen of Troy, driven mad by the prospect of her daughter's sacrifice to Achilles. Electra portrays a young woman planning to avenge the brutal death of her father at the hands of her mother, while in Heracles the hero seeks vengeance against the evil king who has caused bloodshed in his family.

He Algebra of Infinite Justice (2001) is a collection of essays written by Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy. The book discusses several perspectives of global and local concerns, among them one being the abuse of Nuclear bomb showoffs.

The book discusses several issues from fields as diverse as the political euphoria in India over its successful nuclear bomb tests, the 'power' politics wherein she discusses the power generating companies of the world manipulating the laws and policies of the many power-deprived nations.

Introduction:

A few weeks after India detonated a thermonuclear device in 1998, Arundhati Roy wrote ‘The End of Imagination’. The essay attracted worldwide attention as the voice of a brilliant Indian writer speaking out with clarity and conscience against nuclear weapons. Over the next three and a half years, she wrote a series of political essays on a diverse range of momentous subjects: from the illusory benefits of big dams, to the downside of corporate globalization and the US Government’s war against terror. First published in 2001, The Algebra of Infinite Justice brings together all of Arundhati Roy’s political writings so far. This revised paperback edition includes two new essays, written in early 2002: ‘Democracy: Who’s She When She’s at Home’, that examines the horrific communal violence in Gujarat, and ‘War Talk: Summer Games with Nuclear Bombs’, about the threat of nuclear war in the Subcontinent.",The Algebra of Infinite Justice (Award-Winning Authors' Books),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143419280,"Edition,2017",252,India,English

White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India is a tale with many levels, featuring Captain James Achilles Kirkpatrick as the protagonist. On one level, the book details the tragic romance between Kirkpatrick and Khair-un-Nissa, a Muslim noblewoman. On a different level, the story sheds light on the social, military, political, and trade aspects of 18th and 19th century India.

Captain Kirkpatrick is an ambitious soldier in the East India Company. When his eyes settle upon the beautiful Khair, the Nizam’s great-niece, the course of his life takes a new direction. Kirkpatrick soon learns that he must overcome many obstacles in order to marry Khair. Firstly, she is locked in purdah and engaged to be married to a nobleman. Secondly, as a Resident, Kirkpatrick is obligated to convert to Islam, which he hopes will make it easier for him to marry Khair. Kirkpatrick also ends up working as a double-agent, while working for the East India Company, he is actually supporting the Hyderabadis.

Apart from this love story, Dalrymple, also presents a side of history which is virtually unexplored by historians. Through memorable characters such as Hindoo Stuart and Sir David Ochterlony, the author draws readers’ attention to the concept of “white Mughals”. These are people of British descent who had adopted Indian customs, traditions, but who were also a source of embarrassment for colonial administrations. After conducting over five years of research, the author portrays a fascinating portrait about social etiquette, sexual and dismissive attitudes, and the growing racist treatment by the ruling British class towards the offspring of mixed race couples.
White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India won the 2003 Scottish Book Of the Year. In 2011, Dalrymple announced that British actor Ralph Fiennes would act and direct the movie-version of book.

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.) 
Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention). 
We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.
Yeah, there's going to be trouble. Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.
On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again. 
Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.) 
Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

“The Starry Night” shows Sexton’s identification with another tortured and suicidal artist, Vincent van Gogh. The short, free-verse poem begins with an epigraph from one of van Gogh’s letters to his brother. “That does not keep me from having a terrible need of—shall I say the word—religion,” van Gogh wrote. “Then I go out at night to paint the stars.” Sexton used epigraphs from a variety of works to begin her poems, and the epigraphs are often of major importance, pointing to a main theme of the poem that might otherwise be overlooked. Here she is indicating that she shares not only the mental imbalance, suicidal tendencies, and artistic nature of the Dutch artist but also his unsatisfied desire for the spiritual.

When van Gogh wrote the letter to his brother, he was painting the masterpiece Starry Night on the Rhone, which is described in the poem. The painting captures the night sky in blues and blacks, with a swirl of violent orange representing the moon, and burning yellow-white stars. One would expect a peaceful scene from the title, but this painting is intensely disquieting. The movement seems to be a great rush skyward, the sleeping town beneath the sky unconscious of this spiraling of all nature toward infinity. Sexton sees this painting as a reflection of her own death wish. The dark tree at the edge of the painting is described as “black-haired”—Sexton was a brunette—and it “slips/ up like a drowned woman into the hot sky.” To make her meaning clearer, she continues, “This is how/ I want to die.”

The poem interprets the painting as presenting a nature that is animate and hostile. Nevertheless, the picture attracts the speaker, because nature’s brute force promises death, release from the burden of self. Sexton sees the central moon image in the painting as a great dragon that will suck her up into its being. She desires, she says, “to split/ from my life with no flag,/ no belly,/ no cry”—to merge silently and painlessly with the infinite. The images may suggest not a rediscovery of religion but a terrifying substitute for it. Part of the appeal of this poem lies in the vivid interpretation of the painting and in the kinship the reader sees between Sexton and van Gogh.",Starry Nights,Shobhaa De, , ,Penguin Books,9780143421313,"1st Edition,2013",315,India,English

Insiders know that besides her commitment to work and the frantic pace of her life, Shobhaa Dé's first priority in life has always been her family. Here she writes poignantly of her early years, and of her relationship with her parents and siblings, her husband and her children. Shobha De's high voltage career 'happened' in unexpected ways, starting with her unplanned entry as a teenager into the glamorous world of modeling, and moving on to her high-profile years as a magazine editor. In these avatars she keenly observed and astutely chronicled the new India— brash, affluent and ambitious. High-society hi-jinks, movie star follies, celebrity neurosis— none of these escaped her unsparing eye. And now she tells it all, just as it was, just as she saw it. In her inimitably forthright fashion, she writes of the choices she made, the decisions she took and the influences that shaped her.

One Hundred Years Of Solitude, a literary masterpiece by the Nobel Laureate, is a metaphoric mirror to Colombian history. The contemplative novel drapes the tale of the rise and fall of Macondo and magically captures the life and times of the Buendia family over seven generations.  

Summary Of The Book:
Set in a fictional town called Macondo in Northern Colombia, One Hundred Years Of Solitude begins with Jose Arcadio Buendia leaving his hometown with his wife Ursula, in search of a better life. One night during their journey, they happen to camp at a riverside where Jose dreams about a spectacular city and decides to establish one on the same riverbank. Thus, he builds Macondo and slowly shapes it into how he wants a city to be. Macondo then begins to miraculously attract unusual people and extraordinary events that make for a gripping plot. The adventurous Buendias find themselves in the middle of some of the most historically potent 
circumstances in Colombia. As the lineage stands in the face of the glory and downfall of a civilization, Marquez's lyrical magic manifests the delicate nuances of love and war, youth and senility, and passion and lust. And finally, what had started as an innocent dream of Jose, Ursula and 19 other families gradually break down and fall prey to lawless anarchy. 

One Hundred Years Of Solitude also chronicles the political and economic developments of the 19th century Colombia, such as corruption and capitalism with a touch of fiction. In a deeply touching and thought provoking non-linear narrative, Marquez paints a hundred years of history on the canvas of time. He uses his prerogative of having witnessed the wave of the Colombian revolution to graphically depict its lasting influence. He arrests in prose, the magical realism surrounding life, death, peace and the truth of mankind. 

Written originally in Spanish, One Hundred Years Of Solitude was published first in 1967. It has since been translated into 37 languages and sold more than 20 million copies worldover. A recipient of global acclaim and numerous awards, the book won Marquez his Nobel Prize in 1982.

The book starts with Greg writing about how his mother is always saying that ""friends will come and go but family is forever."" Greg doesn't believe that, since his friend, Rowley, now has a girlfriend named Abigail, continuing from the events of the last book. Ever since then, Rowley has been acting different, such as refusing to hang out with Greg and agreeing with everything Abigail says.

Greg has been getting bored without Rowley, so his mother tells him to ""branch out"" and make friends with the kids in the neighborhood. He decides to become friends with Fregley, since he could ""mold him into EXACTLY the type of friend [he] need[s]."" Greg tries to get Fregley to do funny things during lunch, and Fregley then becomes popular after the other kids find out that he can ""chew"" food with his belly button.

Greg's mother announces that her extended family will come to town for Easter. Greg then writes about some of his family members, including Meemaw, who organized egg hunts in the backyard. On Easter, the family notices through a photo album that Meemaw has hidden her diamond ring in an egg, and everyone rushes out to find it, although the search is unsuccessful.

Greg decides to join an after-school activity, and with the help of a Magic 8-Ball he found on Easter, he becomes a member of the Yearbook Club. The next day, Greg accidentally drops his Magic 8-Ball, and it breaks. Greg is called to the yearbook office to take yearbook photos of Fregley (Most Popular) and Rowley and Abigail (Cutest Couple). He then resigns from his position.

Greg throws his broken Magic 8-Ball into his grandmother's yard. At school, he learns that Rowley and Abigail have broken up. Greg wonders if he and Rowley should be friends again. He goes back to the Magic 8-Ball, hoping to get ""one last good answer,"" and finds the plastic egg with Meemaw's ring. To avoid breaking up his family, he hides the egg in his mother's closet.

Greg concludes that he has to make big decisions on his own, and reconciles with Rowley. He writes, ""I know Mom's always saying that friends come and go and family is forever, and maybe that's true. [...] I'm sure me and Rowley will get in another fight somewhere down the road and then we'll go through this drama all over again. But for now, we're good.""",Diary of a Wimpy Kid : Hard Luck,Jeff Kinney, , ,Penguin Books,9780141353074,"Edition,2016",236,India,English

The God of Small Things is the debut novel of Indian writer Arundhati Roy. It is a story about the childhood experiences of fraternal twins whose lives are destroyed by the ""Love Laws"" that lay down ""who should be loved, and how. And how much."" The book explores how the small things affect people's behavior and their lives. It won the Booker Prize in 1997.

ndian history and politics shape the plot and meaning of The God of Small Things in a variety of ways. Some of Roy's commentary is on the surface, with jokes and snippets of wisdom about political realities in India. However, the novel also examines the historical roots of these realities and develops profound insights into the ways in which human desperation and desire emerge from the confines of a firmly entrenched caste society.

The story is set in the caste society of India, at a time when members of the Untouchable Paravan or Paryan caste were not permitted to touch members of higher castes or enter their houses. The Untouchables were considered polluted beings. They had the lowliest jobs and lived in subhuman conditions. In India, the caste system was considered a way to organize society. Roy's book shows how terribly cruel such a system can be.

Along with the caste system, readers see an economic class struggle. The Ipes are considered upper class. They are factory owners, the dominating class. Mammachi and Baby Kochamma would not deign to mix with those of a lower class.

However, Roy shows other types of less evident discrimination. For example, there is religious discrimination. It is unacceptable for a Syrian Christian to marry a Hindu and vice versa, and Hindus can only marry a Hindu from the same caste. In more than one passage of the book, the reader feels Rahel's and Estha's discomfort at being half Hindu. Baby Kochamma constantly makes disparaging comments about Hindus. On the other hand, there is discomfort even between Christian denominations as is shown by Pappachi's negative reaction when Baby Kochamma converts to Catholicism.

Chacko suffers more veiled racial discrimination, as it seems his daughter also does. His English wife's parents were shocked and disapproving that their daughter would marry an Indian, no matter how well educated. Sophie, at one point, mentions to her cousins that they are all ""wog,"" while she is ""half-wog.""

The Ipes are very class-conscious and feel a need to maintain their status. Discrimination is a way of protecting their privileged position in society.",The God of Small Things (Man Booker Prize 1997),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143028574,"1st Published,2002",340,India,English

The Partition in history is a record of a point in time when the country was split apart along religious lines. It is an abstract piece of history for most people. While many books have documented the Partition and the violence surrounding it, most have focused on the social and political causes, and analyzed it as a collection of abstract data. Train To Pakistan is one of the books that focuses on the human drama, the real suffering of the people caught in the middle.
Mano Majra is a village that suddenly becomes part of a border between two countries. The population of the village is predominantly Sikh and Muslim. When news of communal riots and killings reach the village, the different communities express their support for each other and swear to defend one another. However, external influences are just waiting around the corner to disturb this idyllic harmony.
A train filled with the massacred bodies of Hindus and Sikhs arrives at Mano Majra. Slowly, passions gets stoked up, especially by the influx of refugees from the newly created Pakistan. They have tales of horror to tell, and the passions of Sikhs and Hindus of the village are stirred up.
Vested interests, including that of the village magistrate’s, stir up the flames. Hindus and Sikhs who just recently swore to stand by their Muslim neighbors now turn against them. Caught in all this are Juggut Singh and Iqbal. Juggut is a criminal, while Iqbal is a western educated intellectual who is on a mission to reform society. The common thread that binds them together is that they are both thrown into jail as suspects in a murder.
Ram Lal, a local moneylender, has been murdered. Ram Lal was a Hindu and this is used by subversive elements to incite violence against Muslims. The police, in a desperate attempt to divert attention, arrest Iqbal and Juggut.
Meanwhile, as the violence escalates, a train arrives to take the Muslim population of the village en masse to Pakistan.

Glimpses Of World History was written by Nehru in 1934, which provides the readers a panoramic sweep of history, comprising 196 letters in total. These letters were written from a number of prisons in British India from 1930 to 1933. The sole objective of these letters was to introduce Nehru’s daughter, Indira, to world history. In his first letter, Nehru tells Indira about his sadness at being unable to send her any material gift from prison. He goes on to tell her that he would give her something he could afford, which was a series of letters, straight from his heart.

Since these letters were written during his time in prison, Nehru didn’t have access to any reference books, but only his personal notes. Through the course of this book, he covers the history of mankind from 6000 BC till the time he wrote this book. He tells the readers about the rise and fall of large civilizations and empires from Rome, Greece, West Asia, and China. He also throws light on several renowned historical figures such as Genghis Khan, Vladimir Lenin, Mohandas K. Gandhi, and Ashoka. One of his chapters talks about Genghis Khan and the Mongol invasion in a way that is against major European views of that time. He mentions that Genghis was, without doubt, history’s greatest military genius and leader, considering Alexander and Caesar petty before Genghis.

He wrote about several cultures in detail, as he wasn’t in favor of the current way history was taught at school. Owing to the fact that history teaching at school revolved only around a particular country, he wrote about world history to his daughter, to help her understand why people did what they did. These letters have been written in an informal manner, packed with contemporary as well as personal experiences.

In The Outsider (1942), his classic existentialist novel, Camus explores the alienation of an individual who refuses to conform to social norms. Meursault, his anti-hero, will not lie. When his mother dies, he refuses to show his emotions simply to satisfy the expectations of others. And when he commits a random act of violence on a sun-drenched beach near Algiers, his lack of remorse compounds his guilt in the eyes of society and the law. Yet he is as much a victim as a criminal.

Albert Camus' portrayal of a man confronting the absurd, and revolting against the injustice of society, depicts the paradox of man's joy in life when faced with the 'tender indifference' of the world.

Sandra Smith's translation, based on close listening to a recording of Camus reading his work aloud on French radio in 1954, sensitively renders the subtleties and dream-like atmosphere of L'?tranger.

Albert Camus (1913-1960), French novelist, essayist and playwright, is one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. His most famous works include The Myth of Sisyphus (1942), The Plague (1947), The Just (1949), The Rebel (1951) and The Fall (1956). He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, and his last novel, The First Man, unfinished at the time of his death, appeared in print for the first time in 1994, and was published in English soon after by Hamish Hamilton.

Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is a 2012 non-fiction book written by Susan Cain. Cain argues that modern Western culture misunderstands and undervalues the traits and capabilities of introverted people, leading to ""a colossal waste of talent, energy, and happiness"".

The book presents a history of how Western culture transformed from a culture of character to a culture of personality in which an ""extrovert ideal"" dominates and introversion is viewed as inferior or even pathological. Adopting scientific definitions of introversion and extroversion as preferences for different levels of stimulation, Quiet outlines the advantages and disadvantages of each temperament, emphasizing the myth of the extrovert ideal that has dominated in the West since the early twentieth century. Asserting that temperament is a core element of human identity, Cain cites research in biology, psychology, neuroscience and evolution to demonstrate that introversion is both common and normal, noting that many of humankind's most creative individuals and distinguished leaders were introverts. Cain urges changes at the workplace, in schools, and in parenting; offers advice to introverts for functioning in an extrovert-dominated culture; and offers advice in communication, work, and relationships between people of differing temperament.",Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can not Stop Talking,Susan Cain, , ,Penguin Books,9780307352156,"1st Edition,2013",348,Abroad,English

Love in the Time of Cholera is a celebration of life over death, love over despair, and health over sickness. It is the story of Florentino Ariza, who was rejected by Fermina Daza in his youth. He maintains a silent vigil of unrequited love for fifty-one years, nine months, and four days, until he meets Fermina again at her husband’s wake and renews his suit. The novel spans a period from the late 1870’s to the early 1930’s, and it is set in a South American community modeled after Cartagena, Colombia, and besieged by civil wars and plagues.

Florentino, an eighteen-year-old apprentice telegraph operator, sees thirteen-year old Fermina and falls madly in love. Fermina’s father finds out and sends his daughter on an extended trip to remove her from temptation. She returns years later, rejects Florentino, and accepts the proposal of a cultured physician and cholera specialist, Dr. Juvenal Urbino. Although Florentino continues to love Fermina throughout the years, he also continues his own social relationships—engaging in 622 long-term liaisons, which he records in a series of notebooks—and becomes president of a riverboat company. Then Florentino learns that eighty-one-year-old Juvenal has died, falling off a ladder trying to capture a condescending, bilingual parrot.

Land of Two Rivers: A History of Bengal provides an incisive look into the history of Bengal, one of the most fascinating and influential regions in the Indian subcontinent. Located at the confluence of two major rivers, Ganga and Brahmaputra, Bengal has been the center of trade, learning and the arts for the longest time. In the medieval era, the rise of Muslim dynasties in Bengal brought into being a unique culture which was very different from that of northern India. The British colonization in the 18th century further transformed the social and economic structure of the region. In this book, the author traces the formation of Bengali identity through the Bengal Renaissance, the growth of nationalist politics and partition of Bengal in 1947. This book will make for an engaging and informative read for those interested in the history of Bengal.

The story unfolds on a cold April day in 1984 in Oceania, the totalitarian superpower in post World War II Europe. Winston Smith, employed as a records (no, not vinyl) editor at the Ministry of Truth, drags himself home to Victory Mansions (nothing victorious about them) for lunch. Depressed and oppressed, he starts a journal of his rebellious thoughts against the Party. If discovered, this journal will result in his execution. Now that’s playing with fire. For the sake of added precautions, Winston only writes when safe from the view of the surveying telescreens. And when that shot of industrial grade ""Victory Gin"" kicks in.

At work, Winston becomes curious about ""the brunette"" (a.k.a. Julia), a machine-operator in the Fiction Department. Although at one time he feared that she was a member of the Thought Police, all such paranoia ends when she slips him a note reading ""I love you"" in the corridor one day. The two begin a secret love affair, first meeting up in the countryside, and then in a rented room atop Mr. Charrington’s shop in the prole district. All of these places are away from surveillance – or so they think.

As Winston and Julia fall deeper in love, Winston’s views about their government (the Party) change. There’s something about Ingsoc that doesn’t seem quite right – is it the manipulation? The changing of history? The all-around sketchiness? Winston is drawn to the revolutionary ""Brotherhood"" because, well, they’re revolutionary. Eventually, Winston makes contact with O’Brien, who Winston thinks is a member of the Brotherhood, but who in actuality is a member of the Thought Police. O’Brien arranges for Winston to receive a copy of ""the book,"" a resistance manifesto which supposedly exposes the how and the why for the resistance.

Unfortunately, Winston never finds out the why. Instead, he gets tortured. But before the torturing, he and Julia are apprehended by the Thought Police. Turns out that secret hiding place wasn’t so secret after all. The happy couple is then brought to the Ministry of Love, where criminals and opponents of the Party are tortured, interrogated, and ""reintegrated"" before their release and ultimate execution. O’Brien runs the show as far as Winston’s torture sessions are concerned.

Months later, Winston is sent to Room 101, where a person is faced with his greatest fear. Rats…why did it have to be rats? Musing on the impending rats-chewing-on-his-face scenario, Winston calls out, ""Do it to Julia!"" That’s pretty much what O’Brien was looking for, so Winston gets to go back to being a happy member of the rat race. Released, Winston’s heart is filled with love for the Party. Even when he and Julia meet again by chance, they feel apathetic towards each other. The last man in Europe has been converted and destroyed. Quite the fine point there, George.

This results in ""a sort of gender-based Planet of the Apes where the roles are reversed and the men are locked away in a technologically advanced future.

There, traditional stereotypes such as “Men have bigger brains” and women are ""naturally weak"" are countered with logic such as ""an elephant also has a bigger and heavier brain"" and “a lion is stronger than a man” and yet neither of them dominates men.[3] In Ladyland crime is eliminated, since men were considered responsible for all of it. The workday is only two hours long, since men used to waste six hours of each day in smoking. The religion is one of love and truth.

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.)

Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention).

We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.

Yeah, there's going to be trouble.

Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.

On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again.

Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.)

Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

Marquez's novel is very repetitive and nonlinear, so we're going to lay it down for you in a straightforward and chronological order. It's not what Marquez intended, but it sure is easier to understand.

Six months before 'the incident,' Bayardo San Román comes barging into town looking like he's the best thing since sliced bread. No one knows who he is, and the only thing they do know is that he's looking for a wife. Apparently no one in town thinks this is sketchy, so we'll roll with it too.

One day he randomly chooses Angela as his bride-to-be, despite the fact that she has no interest in him at all. His unrequited love is totally in line with his sketchy character, but everyone seems to ignore the sketch-factor because the dude's richer than Bill Gates. Anyway, Angela's lack of love for Bayardo is not the only problem. She has a secret: She's not a virgin.

Angela's impoverished family doesn't care about this fact and they basically force her into marrying Bayardo. After four months, they have the biggest wedding the town has ever seen. Everyone who's anyone (and some people who aren't even anyone) comes to the party. But it all comes crashing down on their wedding night when it's revealed that Angela is not a virgin.

Bayardo takes her back home, where Angela's mom beats her for about two hours. She tells her brothers that Santiago is the guy who deflowered her, and that's when the murder plot begins.

The next day, the town is still in a festive mood because the Bishop is supposed to visit. They even have crazy amounts of roosters prepared for his favorite cock-comb soup. So even though it's Monday, everything is not operating the way it would normally, which is unfortunate for poor Santiago.

In the hours that follow, everything that could go wrong does go wrong. It's like the darkest black comedy you've ever seen. By 6 AM everyone in town knows that the brothers are going to kill Santiago, but no one does anything. Even though the brothers don't want to kill him, no one stops them. What the heck is up with this town?

In the end, Santiago is killed at his own doorstep.

After the murder, the whole town can't stop talking about it. Angela's family leaves town and so does her husband of five hours. There's even a trial, but it doesn't seem that anything comes of it aside from some pretty cool records written in red ink.

Our lives and specifically the market are so full of random aspects and complex structures. Understanding the behaviour of markets and attributing specific reasons to its behaviour is totally impossible and sometimes a useless task. As the title explains, Taleb’s theory explains how all of us get fooled easily by randomness. Taleb goes on to elaborate how we misconstrue luck and skill. Wherever true luck plays a role, we assume it to be the work of individual skill. Most impressive situations in life are only due to luck, claims Taleb. He uses the theory of black swans (rare events) to propound his idea and says that black swans cannot be predicted.

Taleb elucidates his theory through some popular examples using people like the baseball expert Yogi Berra, the philosopher Karl Popper, the ancient wise man Solon, the financier George Soros and the Greek voyager Odysseus. Most of all, journalists and traders fall for the randomness as well. In addition to real-life examples, Taleb also brings in the case of the fictitious hero Nero, who is smart enough to understand the play of randomness in his professional life, but is superstitiously foolish.

Taleb also constructs an invincible, nameless fool who seems to be at the right place at the right time. The fool has a steady string of followers who are ready to do anything for their Guru. But, the fool’s actions cannot be imitated. His success is one obtained by chance.

The most unexpected things will happen for sure. But, we become creatures of routine that we fail to identify it when it happens. Moreover, detecting risks and accepting them is done only by the emotional part of the brain. If we understand probability, then we can perceive the role of luck in everyday situations. The trick lies in recognizing it. Taleb says we must be aware of the trap that luck sets for us.

How do we distinguish a lucky poseur from a far-sighted visionary? How do we read an incident? How do we decide whether it is luck or talent that made the person successful?

Fooled By Randomness: The Hidden Role Of Chance In The Markets And In Life received wide recognition. Fortune named it as one of the smartest books of all time and the Financial Times termed it as the Book of the Year.

Is life worth living? If life does not possess any significance when confronted with the reality of human existence, is suicide our only alternative? In the essay, Camus introduces the readers to his philosophy of the absurd where man’s futile search for meaning, unity and clarity is questioned. The author states that to realize the reason for our existence, we need to break the norms of normalcy and revolt. During the course of the book, Camus outlines numerous approaches to the absurd life. The author compares the absurdity of human life with the situation of Sisyphus, a Greek mythological figure who was condemned to forever repeat a meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain only to see it roll down again.

In a very engaging and interesting manner, the author states that humans should embrace the absurd. By embracing the absurd, it means that we accept all the unreasonable things that the world has to offer. Camus arrives at three consequences from the full acknowledgement of the absurd, revolt, freedom and passion. How then should the absurd man live? What is the purpose of life? Is suicide the answer to all the problems in life? Through a philosophical series of questioning, this book truly depicts life in a unique and refreshing manner. The book is for all those people who are interested in the philosophy of existentialism, this book will truly engage the readers till the last page.

Camus has drawn some very powerful consequences about life and mortality. Knowing the fact that one day all of us are going to die is a great liberator. Therefore traditions accepted as morals, ethics accepted as habits, all cease to be less important when we know that our time on the planet is limited. An oversimplified version of the essay is that man is only a small part of a vast and endless universe and that the most a man can do is to live their life to the fullest at every moment.

The story unfolds on a cold April day in 1984 in Oceania, the totalitarian superpower in post World War II Europe. Winston Smith, employed as a records (no, not vinyl) editor at the Ministry of Truth, drags himself home to Victory Mansions (nothing victorious about them) for lunch. Depressed and oppressed, he starts a journal of his rebellious thoughts against the Party. If discovered, this journal will result in his execution. Now that’s playing with fire. For the sake of added precautions, Winston only writes when safe from the view of the surveying telescreens. And when that shot of industrial grade ""Victory Gin"" kicks in.
At work, Winston becomes curious about ""the brunette"" (a.k.a. Julia), a machine-operator in the Fiction Department. Although at one time he feared that she was a member of the Thought Police, all such paranoia ends when she slips him a note reading ""I love you"" in the corridor one day. The two begin a secret love affair, first meeting up in the countryside, and then in a rented room atop Mr. Charrington’s shop in the prole district. All of these places are away from surveillance – or so they think. 
As Winston and Julia fall deeper in love, Winston’s views about their government (the Party) change. There’s something about Ingsoc that doesn’t seem quite right – is it the manipulation? The changing of history? The all-around sketchiness? Winston is drawn to the revolutionary ""Brotherhood"" because, well, they’re revolutionary. Eventually, Winston makes contact with O’Brien, who Winston thinks is a member of the Brotherhood, but who in actuality is a member of the Thought Police. O’Brien arranges for Winston to receive a copy of ""the book,"" a resistance manifesto which supposedly exposes the how and the why for the resistance. 
Unfortunately, Winston never finds out the why. Instead, he gets tortured. But before the torturing, he and Julia are apprehended by the Thought Police. Turns out that secret hiding place wasn’t so secret after all. The happy couple is then brought to the Ministry of Love, where criminals and opponents of the Party are tortured, interrogated, and ""reintegrated"" before their release and ultimate execution. O’Brien runs the show as far as Winston’s torture sessions are concerned. 
Months later, Winston is sent to Room 101, where a person is faced with his greatest fear. Rats…why did it have to be rats? Musing on the impending rats-chewing-on-his-face scenario, Winston calls out, ""Do it to Julia!"" That’s pretty much what O’Brien was looking for, so Winston gets to go back to being a happy member of the rat race. Released, Winston’s heart is filled with love for the Party. Even when he and Julia meet again by chance, they feel apathetic towards each other. The last man in Europe has been converted and destroyed. Quite the fine point there, George.

This book serves as a follow-up book to the author’s bestselling 1999 book, The Power Of Now, which promoted the idea that in order to achieve lasting happiness, human beings must learn to dissociate their thoughts from their identities. A New Earth: Create A Better Life builds extensively upon the same primary theme, exploring a different perspective this time around.

The first book had an introspective quality and focused on the spiritual needs of the individual. On the other hand, this book turns the spotlight outwards, choosing to highlight the ways in which an individual’s spiritual evolution can be instrumental in shaping humanity’s collective spiritual consciousness.

Divided into ten chapters, the book begins with a chapter on the awakening of human consciousness. The next three chapters focus on the concept of ego, exploring how attachment towards one’s thoughts, memories, and possessions can give rise to an illusory and harmful sense of self.

In the subsequent chapters, the author discusses concepts such as recurring emotional pain, the space of consciousness, and inner and outer purpose. The final chapter presents the three elements that the author considers to be collectively representative of an awakened consciousness.

A New Earth: Create A Better Life was first published in 2005 by Penguin. It went on to receive high worldwide acclaim, its popularity scaling further when it was chosen as a recommended title by Oprah Winfrey’s Book Club in 2008. This edition is a 2009 reprint by Penguin Books.

The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Late Spring and Autumn Period (roughly 5th century BC). The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (""Master Sun"", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to an aspect of warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare[1] and has influenced both Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy and beyond.

This book contained a detailed explanation and analysis of the Chinese military, from weapons and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun Tzu also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Because Sun Tzu has long been considered to be one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training for centuries to come.
Chapter summary
1. Detail assessment and planning: explores the five fundamental factors (the Way, seasons, terrain, leadership, and management) and seven elements that determine the outcomes of military engagements. By thinking, assessing and comparing these points, a commander can calculate his chances of victory. Habitual deviation from these calculations will ensure failure via improper action. The text stresses that war is a very grave matter for the state and must not be commenced without due consideration.
2. Waging war : explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how success requires winning decisive engagements quickly. This section advises that successful military campaigns require limiting the cost of competition and conflict.
3. Strategic attack : defines the source of strength as unity, not size, and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war. In order of importance, these critical factors are: Attack, Strategy, Alliances, Army and Cities.
4. Disposition of the army : explains the importance of defending existing positions until a commander is capable of advancing from those positions in safety. It teaches commanders the importance of recognizing strategic opportunities, and teaches not to create opportunities for the enemy.
5. Forces : explains the use of creativity and timing in building an army's momentum.
6. Weaknesses and strengths : explains how an army's opportunities come from the openings in the environment caused by the relative weakness of the enemy and how to respond to changes in the fluid battlefield over a given area.
7. Military maneuvers : explains the dangers of direct conflict and how to win those confrontations when they are forced upon the commander.
8. Variations and adaptability : focuses on the need for flexibility in an army's responses. It explains how to respond to shifting circumstances successfully.
9. Movement and development of troops : describes the different situations in which an army finds itself as it moves through new enemy territories, and how to respond to these situations. Much of this section focuses on evaluating the intentions of others.
10. Terrain : looks at the three general areas of resistance (distance, dangers and barriers) and the six types of ground positions that arise from them. Each of these six field positions offers certain advantages and disadvantages.
11. The nine battlegrounds : describes the nine common situations (or stages) in a campaign, from scattering to deadly, and the specific focus that a commander will need in order to successfully navigate them.
12. Attacking with fire : explains the general use of weapons and the specific use of the environment as a weapon. This section examines the five targets for attack, the five types of environmental attack and the appropriate responses to such attacks.
13. Intelligence and espionage : focuses on the importance of developing good information sources, and specifies the five types of intelligence sources and how to best manage each of them.",The Art of War,Sun Tzu,John Minford, ,Penguin Books,9780140455526,"1st edition,2008",112,India,English

“Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None” is a novel by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche that was originally published in four parts between 1883 and 1891.

The novel is a philosophical treatise on Nietzsche’s ideals and his idea of the “overman”. Several of the philosopher’s most famous concepts are introduced in the novel. Including the idea that God is dead (meaning that societies old foundations are dead and that the idea of good and evil has changed) and the “eternal recurrence of the same” or the idea that time is an everlasting line and that anything that can happen has already happened and will happen again eventually.


 
Nietzsche uses the protagonist of the fifth century B.C.E. Philosopher, Zarathustra in order to tell the story. Zarathustra comes down from his mountain top cave to preach to the people about the Overman but is soon rebuked. The book is mainly comprised of Zarathustra’s lessons to the people and to himself.

Globalization has been viewed as a perfect solution for the problems of many weak and nascent economies. A globally integrated economy that allowed the free flow of capital across borders was supposed to benefit the countries that opened up their markets.

That idea has not really worked out well in many places. There is an increasing number of voices protesting against globalization policies. This book, Globalization And Its Discontents analyses the reasons for this rising opposition.

The book does not explicitly take an anti globalization stand. It just inquires into the failures of the idea in certain regions of the world. It examines the factors that contributed towards this failure. The author mainly focuses on the policies of international organizations like the IMF and the World Bank. He says that the global organizations employed a one solution fits all policy. They did not take into account the unique problems and needs of each country that they tried to help. They simply worked on the belief that a free market was the cure to all economic ills.

The author takes up the cases of South Asia and Russia to illustrate his points. He says institutions like the IMF encouraged free flow of capital even in regions without a strongly regulated financial sector. This left the field open for speculative short term investors. These investors panicked and pulled out at the slightest signs of an economic crisis. This destabilized the already weak economies of many developing countries, and whole nations went bankrupt.

The loans from IMF imposed strict conditions on the borrowing countries. These included asking the countries to cut their expenditure on public spending like food subsidies. When economies collapsed and many people lost their jobs, they did not even have a social safety net to fall back on. This led to social and political unrest in countries like Indonesia and Russia. So, the institutions that were supposed to help these countries strengthen their economies instead worsened the crisis, says the author. Globalization And Its Discontents says globalization as such is not a bad idea. It brings in global funding into poor economies and opens up new opportunities and new markets.

What is needed, says the author, are reforms in the functioning of institutions like the IMF. He says that there is need for increased transparency and accountability in these organizations.

The Metamorphosis and Other Stories, by Franz Kafka, is part of the Barnes and Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes and Noble Classics:
All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes and Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.


Virtually unknown during his lifetime, Franz Kafka is now one of the world’s most widely read and discussed authors. His nightmarish novels and short stories have come to symbolize modern man’s anxiety and alienation in a bizarre, hostile, and dehumanized world. This vision is most fully realized in Kafka’s masterpiece, “The Metamorphosis,” a story that is both harrowing and amusing, and a landmark of modern literature. 

Bringing together some of Kafka’s finest work, this collection demonstrates the richness and variety of the author’s artistry. “The Judgment,” which Kafka considered to be his decisive breakthrough, and “The Stoker,” which became the first chapter of his novel Amerika, are here included. These two, along with “The Metamorphosis,” form a suite of stories Kafka referred to as “The Sons,” and they collectively present a devastating portrait of the modern family.

Also included are “In the Penal Colony,” a story of a torture machine and its operators and victims, and “A Hunger Artist,” about the absurdity of an artist trying to communicate with a misunderstanding public. Kafka’s lucid, succinct writing chronicles the labyrinthine complexities, the futility-laden horror, and the stifling oppressiveness that permeate his vision of modern life.

Justice has multiple dimensions and cannot be defined as or decided upon in singular terms. It can mean different things to different people in different instances. It is, in simple words, understood as existing and varying on a continuum. This is the central aspect of the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen’s book, The Idea Of Justice.

This remarkable book by the distinguished economist questions the very notion of social justice being a far-fetched ideal or an achievable and practical possibility. The book defines a perfectly just society and also traces the concept of social justice as understood by philosophers and thinkers over ages. People have continued to face differences in opinions regarding what is just and what is not, and the book places special emphasis on the alternative and comparative perspectives on justice.

The author has introduced an approach to justice followed by the demands of justice, materials of justice, forms of reasoning, and public reasoning and democracy. Within the four parts the book has been divided into are chapters covering endlessly thought-provoking topics.

This book, published in 2009, is dedicated to the memory of one of Amartya Sen’s teachers, named John Rawls.

The first playwright to depict suffering without reference to the gods, Euripides (484-407 BC) made his characters speak in human terms and face the consequences of their actions. In Medea, a woman rejected by her lover takes hideous revenge by murdering the children they both love, and Hecabe depicts the former queen of Troy, driven mad by the prospect of her daughter's sacrifice to Achilles. Electra portrays a young woman planning to avenge the brutal death of her father at the hands of her mother, while in Heracles the hero seeks vengeance against the evil king who has caused bloodshed in his family.

The journey in The Discovery of India begins from ancient history, leading up to the last years of the British Raj. He uses his knowledge of the Upanishads, Vedas, and textbooks on ancient history to introduce to the reader the development of India from the Indus Valley Civilization, through the changes in socio-political old scene scenario every foreign invader brought, to the present day conditions.

Nehru was jailed for his participation in the Quit India movement along with other Indian leaders, and he used this time to write down his thoughts and knowledge about India's history. The book is widely regarded as a classic in India since its first publication in 1946[citation needed], and provides a broad view of Indian history, philosophy and culture, as viewed from the eyes of a liberal Indian fighting for the independence of his country.

In The Discovery of India, Nehru argued that India was a historic nation with a right to sovereignty. This book also analyses in depth the philosophy of Indian life. (wikipedia.org)",The Discovery of India,Jawaharlal Nehru, , ,Penguin Books,9780143031031,"Reprinted,2010",642,India,English

He Algebra of Infinite Justice (2001) is a collection of essays written by Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy. The book discusses several perspectives of global and local concerns, among them one being the abuse of Nuclear bomb showoffs.

The book discusses several issues from fields as diverse as the political euphoria in India over its successful nuclear bomb tests, the 'power' politics wherein she discusses the power generating companies of the world manipulating the laws and policies of the many power-deprived nations.

Introduction:

A few weeks after India detonated a thermonuclear device in 1998, Arundhati Roy wrote ‘The End of Imagination’. The essay attracted worldwide attention as the voice of a brilliant Indian writer speaking out with clarity and conscience against nuclear weapons. Over the next three and a half years, she wrote a series of political essays on a diverse range of momentous subjects: from the illusory benefits of big dams, to the downside of corporate globalization and the US Government’s war against terror. First published in 2001, The Algebra of Infinite Justice brings together all of Arundhati Roy’s political writings so far. This revised paperback edition includes two new essays, written in early 2002: ‘Democracy: Who’s She When She’s at Home’, that examines the horrific communal violence in Gujarat, and ‘War Talk: Summer Games with Nuclear Bombs’, about the threat of nuclear war in the Subcontinent.",The Algebra of Infinite Justice (Award-Winning Authors' Books),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143419280,"Edition,2017",252,India,English

White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India is a tale with many levels, featuring Captain James Achilles Kirkpatrick as the protagonist. On one level, the book details the tragic romance between Kirkpatrick and Khair-un-Nissa, a Muslim noblewoman. On a different level, the story sheds light on the social, military, political, and trade aspects of 18th and 19th century India.

Captain Kirkpatrick is an ambitious soldier in the East India Company. When his eyes settle upon the beautiful Khair, the Nizam’s great-niece, the course of his life takes a new direction. Kirkpatrick soon learns that he must overcome many obstacles in order to marry Khair. Firstly, she is locked in purdah and engaged to be married to a nobleman. Secondly, as a Resident, Kirkpatrick is obligated to convert to Islam, which he hopes will make it easier for him to marry Khair. Kirkpatrick also ends up working as a double-agent, while working for the East India Company, he is actually supporting the Hyderabadis.

Apart from this love story, Dalrymple, also presents a side of history which is virtually unexplored by historians. Through memorable characters such as Hindoo Stuart and Sir David Ochterlony, the author draws readers’ attention to the concept of “white Mughals”. These are people of British descent who had adopted Indian customs, traditions, but who were also a source of embarrassment for colonial administrations. After conducting over five years of research, the author portrays a fascinating portrait about social etiquette, sexual and dismissive attitudes, and the growing racist treatment by the ruling British class towards the offspring of mixed race couples.
White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India won the 2003 Scottish Book Of the Year. In 2011, Dalrymple announced that British actor Ralph Fiennes would act and direct the movie-version of book.

Emraan Hashmi is not just a charming face or an unconventional actor. He is not just bold in his character portrayals. Hashmi, or Emmi as his family members call him, is also a father who is level-headed, unfazed and unyielding.

The Kiss of Life is about that time in Hashmi's life when his son needed him the most, the time when all his other experiences paled in comparison to the tennis ball tumour that invaded his son's kidney.

The chapters alternate between the present - the hospital wards, chemo and the shivers - and the past, where Hashmi battles his own doubts of being an actor, the ups and downs in his career, the media branding him as a serial kisser, the typecasting and so on.

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.) 
Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention). 
We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.
Yeah, there's going to be trouble. Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.
On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again. 
Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.) 
Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

The short, free-verse poem begins with an epigraph from one of van Gogh’s letters to his brother. “That does not keep me from having a terrible need of—shall I say the word—religion,” van Gogh wrote. “Then I go out at night to paint the stars.” Sexton used epigraphs from a variety of works to begin her poems, and the epigraphs are often of major importance, pointing to a main theme of the poem that might otherwise be overlooked. Here she is indicating that she shares not only the mental imbalance, suicidal tendencies, and artistic nature of the Dutch artist but also his unsatisfied desire for the spiritual.

When van Gogh wrote the letter to his brother, he was painting the masterpiece Starry Night on the Rhone, which is described in the poem. The painting captures the night sky in blues and blacks, with a swirl of violent orange representing the moon, and burning yellow-white stars. One would expect a peaceful scene from the title, but this painting is intensely disquieting. The movement seems to be a great rush skyward, the sleeping town beneath the sky unconscious of this spiraling of all nature toward infinity. Sexton sees this painting as a reflection of her own death wish. The dark tree at the edge of the painting is described as “black-haired”—Sexton was a brunette—and it “slips/ up like a drowned woman into the hot sky.” To make her meaning clearer, she continues, “This is how/ I want to die.”

The poem interprets the painting as presenting a nature that is animate and hostile. Nevertheless, the picture attracts the speaker, because nature’s brute force promises death, release from the burden of self. Sexton sees the central moon image in the painting as a great dragon that will suck her up into its being. She desires, she says, “to split/ from my life with no flag,/ no belly,/ no cry”—to merge silently and painlessly with the infinite. The images may suggest not a rediscovery of religion but a terrifying substitute for it. Part of the appeal of this poem lies in the vivid interpretation of the painting and in the kinship the reader sees between Sexton and van Gogh.",Starry Nights,Shobhaa De, , ,Penguin Books,9780143421313,"1st Edition,2013",315,India,English

Insiders know that besides her commitment to work and the frantic pace of her life, Shobhaa Dé's first priority in life has always been her family. Here she writes poignantly of her early years, and of her relationship with her parents and siblings, her husband and her children. Shobha De's high voltage career 'happened' in unexpected ways, starting with her unplanned entry as a teenager into the glamorous world of modeling, and moving on to her high-profile years as a magazine editor. In these avatars she keenly observed and astutely chronicled the new India— brash, affluent and ambitious. High-society hi-jinks, movie star follies, celebrity neurosis— none of these escaped her unsparing eye. And now she tells it all, just as it was, just as she saw it. In her inimitably forthright fashion, she writes of the choices she made, the decisions she took and the influences that shaped her.

One Hundred Years Of Solitude, a literary masterpiece by the Nobel Laureate, is a metaphoric mirror to Colombian history. The contemplative novel drapes the tale of the rise and fall of Macondo and magically captures the life and times of the Buendia family over seven generations.  

Summary Of The Book:
Set in a fictional town called Macondo in Northern Colombia, One Hundred Years Of Solitude begins with Jose Arcadio Buendia leaving his hometown with his wife Ursula, in search of a better life. One night during their journey, they happen to camp at a riverside where Jose dreams about a spectacular city and decides to establish one on the same riverbank. Thus, he builds Macondo and slowly shapes it into how he wants a city to be. Macondo then begins to miraculously attract unusual people and extraordinary events that make for a gripping plot. The adventurous Buendias find themselves in the middle of some of the most historically potent 
circumstances in Colombia. As the lineage stands in the face of the glory and downfall of a civilization, Marquez's lyrical magic manifests the delicate nuances of love and war, youth and senility, and passion and lust. And finally, what had started as an innocent dream of Jose, Ursula and 19 other families gradually break down and fall prey to lawless anarchy. 

One Hundred Years Of Solitude also chronicles the political and economic developments of the 19th century Colombia, such as corruption and capitalism with a touch of fiction. In a deeply touching and thought provoking non-linear narrative, Marquez paints a hundred years of history on the canvas of time. He uses his prerogative of having witnessed the wave of the Colombian revolution to graphically depict its lasting influence. He arrests in prose, the magical realism surrounding life, death, peace and the truth of mankind. 

Written originally in Spanish, One Hundred Years Of Solitude was published first in 1967. It has since been translated into 37 languages and sold more than 20 million copies worldover. A recipient of global acclaim and numerous awards, the book won Marquez his Nobel Prize in 1982.

The book starts with Greg writing about how his mother is always saying that ""friends will come and go but family is forever."" Greg doesn't believe that, since his friend, Rowley, now has a girlfriend named Abigail, continuing from the events of the last book. Ever since then, Rowley has been acting different, such as refusing to hang out with Greg and agreeing with everything Abigail says.

Greg has been getting bored without Rowley, so his mother tells him to ""branch out"" and make friends with the kids in the neighborhood. He decides to become friends with Fregley, since he could ""mold him into EXACTLY the type of friend [he] need[s]."" Greg tries to get Fregley to do funny things during lunch, and Fregley then becomes popular after the other kids find out that he can ""chew"" food with his belly button.

Greg's mother announces that her extended family will come to town for Easter. Greg then writes about some of his family members, including Meemaw, who organized egg hunts in the backyard. On Easter, the family notices through a photo album that Meemaw has hidden her diamond ring in an egg, and everyone rushes out to find it, although the search is unsuccessful.

Greg decides to join an after-school activity, and with the help of a Magic 8-Ball he found on Easter, he becomes a member of the Yearbook Club. The next day, Greg accidentally drops his Magic 8-Ball, and it breaks. Greg is called to the yearbook office to take yearbook photos of Fregley (Most Popular) and Rowley and Abigail (Cutest Couple). He then resigns from his position.

Greg throws his broken Magic 8-Ball into his grandmother's yard. At school, he learns that Rowley and Abigail have broken up. Greg wonders if he and Rowley should be friends again. He goes back to the Magic 8-Ball, hoping to get ""one last good answer,"" and finds the plastic egg with Meemaw's ring. To avoid breaking up his family, he hides the egg in his mother's closet.

Greg concludes that he has to make big decisions on his own, and reconciles with Rowley. He writes, ""I know Mom's always saying that friends come and go and family is forever, and maybe that's true. [...] I'm sure me and Rowley will get in another fight somewhere down the road and then we'll go through this drama all over again. But for now, we're good.""",Diary of a Wimpy Kid : Hard Luck,Jeff Kinney, , ,Penguin Books,9780141353074,"Edition,2016",236,India,English

The God of Small Things is the debut novel of Indian writer Arundhati Roy. It is a story about the childhood experiences of fraternal twins whose lives are destroyed by the ""Love Laws"" that lay down ""who should be loved, and how. And how much."" The book explores how the small things affect people's behavior and their lives. It won the Booker Prize in 1997.

ndian history and politics shape the plot and meaning of The God of Small Things in a variety of ways. Some of Roy's commentary is on the surface, with jokes and snippets of wisdom about political realities in India. However, the novel also examines the historical roots of these realities and develops profound insights into the ways in which human desperation and desire emerge from the confines of a firmly entrenched caste society.

The story is set in the caste society of India, at a time when members of the Untouchable Paravan or Paryan caste were not permitted to touch members of higher castes or enter their houses. The Untouchables were considered polluted beings. They had the lowliest jobs and lived in subhuman conditions. In India, the caste system was considered a way to organize society. Roy's book shows how terribly cruel such a system can be.

Along with the caste system, readers see an economic class struggle. The Ipes are considered upper class. They are factory owners, the dominating class. Mammachi and Baby Kochamma would not deign to mix with those of a lower class.

However, Roy shows other types of less evident discrimination. For example, there is religious discrimination. It is unacceptable for a Syrian Christian to marry a Hindu and vice versa, and Hindus can only marry a Hindu from the same caste. In more than one passage of the book, the reader feels Rahel's and Estha's discomfort at being half Hindu. Baby Kochamma constantly makes disparaging comments about Hindus. On the other hand, there is discomfort even between Christian denominations as is shown by Pappachi's negative reaction when Baby Kochamma converts to Catholicism.

Chacko suffers more veiled racial discrimination, as it seems his daughter also does. His English wife's parents were shocked and disapproving that their daughter would marry an Indian, no matter how well educated. Sophie, at one point, mentions to her cousins that they are all ""wog,"" while she is ""half-wog.""

The Ipes are very class-conscious and feel a need to maintain their status. Discrimination is a way of protecting their privileged position in society.",The God of Small Things (Man Booker Prize 1997),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143028574,"1st Published,2002",340,India,English

The Partition in history is a record of a point in time when the country was split apart along religious lines. It is an abstract piece of history for most people. While many books have documented the Partition and the violence surrounding it, most have focused on the social and political causes, and analyzed it as a collection of abstract data. Train To Pakistan is one of the books that focuses on the human drama, the real suffering of the people caught in the middle.
Mano Majra is a village that suddenly becomes part of a border between two countries. The population of the village is predominantly Sikh and Muslim. When news of communal riots and killings reach the village, the different communities express their support for each other and swear to defend one another. However, external influences are just waiting around the corner to disturb this idyllic harmony.
A train filled with the massacred bodies of Hindus and Sikhs arrives at Mano Majra. Slowly, passions gets stoked up, especially by the influx of refugees from the newly created Pakistan. They have tales of horror to tell, and the passions of Sikhs and Hindus of the village are stirred up.
Vested interests, including that of the village magistrate’s, stir up the flames. Hindus and Sikhs who just recently swore to stand by their Muslim neighbors now turn against them. Caught in all this are Juggut Singh and Iqbal. Juggut is a criminal, while Iqbal is a western educated intellectual who is on a mission to reform society. The common thread that binds them together is that they are both thrown into jail as suspects in a murder.
Ram Lal, a local moneylender, has been murdered. Ram Lal was a Hindu and this is used by subversive elements to incite violence against Muslims. The police, in a desperate attempt to divert attention, arrest Iqbal and Juggut.

Glimpses Of World History was written by Nehru in 1934, which provides the readers a panoramic sweep of history, comprising 196 letters in total. These letters were written from a number of prisons in British India from 1930 to 1933. The sole objective of these letters was to introduce Nehru’s daughter, Indira, to world history. In his first letter, Nehru tells Indira about his sadness at being unable to send her any material gift from prison. He goes on to tell her that he would give her something he could afford, which was a series of letters, straight from his heart.

Since these letters were written during his time in prison, Nehru didn’t have access to any reference books, but only his personal notes. Through the course of this book, he covers the history of mankind from 6000 BC till the time he wrote this book. He tells the readers about the rise and fall of large civilizations and empires from Rome, Greece, West Asia, and China. He also throws light on several renowned historical figures such as Genghis Khan, Vladimir Lenin, Mohandas K. Gandhi, and Ashoka. One of his chapters talks about Genghis Khan and the Mongol invasion in a way that is against major European views of that time. He mentions that Genghis was, without doubt, history’s greatest military genius and leader, considering Alexander and Caesar petty before Genghis.

He wrote about several cultures in detail, as he wasn’t in favor of the current way history was taught at school. Owing to the fact that history teaching at school revolved only around a particular country, he wrote about world history to his daughter, to help her understand why people did what they did. These letters have been written in an informal manner, packed with contemporary as well as personal experiences.

In The Outsider (1942), his classic existentialist novel, Camus explores the alienation of an individual who refuses to conform to social norms. Meursault, his anti-hero, will not lie. When his mother dies, he refuses to show his emotions simply to satisfy the expectations of others. And when he commits a random act of violence on a sun-drenched beach near Algiers, his lack of remorse compounds his guilt in the eyes of society and the law. Yet he is as much a victim as a criminal.

Albert Camus' portrayal of a man confronting the absurd, and revolting against the injustice of society, depicts the paradox of man's joy in life when faced with the 'tender indifference' of the world.

Sandra Smith's translation, based on close listening to a recording of Camus reading his work aloud on French radio in 1954, sensitively renders the subtleties and dream-like atmosphere of L'?tranger.

Albert Camus (1913-1960), French novelist, essayist and playwright, is one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. His most famous works include The Myth of Sisyphus (1942), The Plague (1947), The Just (1949), The Rebel (1951) and The Fall (1956). He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, and his last novel, The First Man, unfinished at the time of his death, appeared in print for the first time in 1994, and was published in English soon after by Hamish Hamilton.

Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is a 2012 non-fiction book written by Susan Cain. Cain argues that modern Western culture misunderstands and undervalues the traits and capabilities of introverted people, leading to ""a colossal waste of talent, energy, and happiness"".

The book presents a history of how Western culture transformed from a culture of character to a culture of personality in which an ""extrovert ideal"" dominates and introversion is viewed as inferior or even pathological. Adopting scientific definitions of introversion and extroversion as preferences for different levels of stimulation, Quiet outlines the advantages and disadvantages of each temperament, emphasizing the myth of the extrovert ideal that has dominated in the West since the early twentieth century. Asserting that temperament is a core element of human identity, Cain cites research in biology, psychology, neuroscience and evolution to demonstrate that introversion is both common and normal, noting that many of humankind's most creative individuals and distinguished leaders were introverts. Cain urges changes at the workplace, in schools, and in parenting; offers advice to introverts for functioning in an extrovert-dominated culture; and offers advice in communication, work, and relationships between people of differing temperament.",Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can not Stop Talking,Susan Cain, , ,Penguin Books,9780307352156,"1st Edition,2013",348,Abroad,English

Love in the Time of Cholera is a celebration of life over death, love over despair, and health over sickness. It is the story of Florentino Ariza, who was rejected by Fermina Daza in his youth. He maintains a silent vigil of unrequited love for fifty-one years, nine months, and four days, until he meets Fermina again at her husband’s wake and renews his suit. The novel spans a period from the late 1870’s to the early 1930’s, and it is set in a South American community modeled after Cartagena, Colombia, and besieged by civil wars and plagues.

Florentino, an eighteen-year-old apprentice telegraph operator, sees thirteen-year old Fermina and falls madly in love. Fermina’s father finds out and sends his daughter on an extended trip to remove her from temptation. She returns years later, rejects Florentino, and accepts the proposal of a cultured physician and cholera specialist, Dr. Juvenal Urbino. Although Florentino continues to love Fermina throughout the years, he also continues his own social relationships—engaging in 622 long-term liaisons, which he records in a series of notebooks—and becomes president of a riverboat company. Then Florentino learns that eighty-one-year-old Juvenal has died, falling off a ladder trying to capture a condescending, bilingual parrot.

Darwin's theory of natural selection issued a profound challenge to orthodox thought and belief: no being or species has been specifically created; all are locked into a pitiless struggle for existence, with extinction looming for those not fitted for the task. 

Yet The Origin of Species (1859) is also a humane and inspirational vision of ecological interrelatedness, revealing the complex mutual interdependencies between animal and plant life, climate and physical environment, and - by implication - within the human world. 

Written for the general reader, in a style which combines the rigour of science with the subtlety of literature, The Origin of Species remains one of the founding documents of the modern age.",On the Origin of Species,Charles Darwin, , ,Penguin Books,9780451529060, , ,Abroad,English

Land of Two Rivers: A History of Bengal provides an incisive look into the history of Bengal, one of the most fascinating and influential regions in the Indian subcontinent. Located at the confluence of two major rivers, Ganga and Brahmaputra, Bengal has been the center of trade, learning and the arts for the longest time. In the medieval era, the rise of Muslim dynasties in Bengal brought into being a unique culture which was very different from that of northern India. The British colonization in the 18th century further transformed the social and economic structure of the region. In this book, the author traces the formation of Bengali identity through the Bengal Renaissance, the growth of nationalist politics and partition of Bengal in 1947. This book will make for an engaging and informative read for those interested in the history of Bengal.

The story unfolds on a cold April day in 1984 in Oceania, the totalitarian superpower in post World War II Europe. Winston Smith, employed as a records (no, not vinyl) editor at the Ministry of Truth, drags himself home to Victory Mansions (nothing victorious about them) for lunch. Depressed and oppressed, he starts a journal of his rebellious thoughts against the Party. If discovered, this journal will result in his execution. Now that’s playing with fire. For the sake of added precautions, Winston only writes when safe from the view of the surveying telescreens. And when that shot of industrial grade ""Victory Gin"" kicks in.

At work, Winston becomes curious about ""the brunette"" (a.k.a. Julia), a machine-operator in the Fiction Department. Although at one time he feared that she was a member of the Thought Police, all such paranoia ends when she slips him a note reading ""I love you"" in the corridor one day. The two begin a secret love affair, first meeting up in the countryside, and then in a rented room atop Mr. Charrington’s shop in the prole district. All of these places are away from surveillance – or so they think.

As Winston and Julia fall deeper in love, Winston’s views about their government (the Party) change. There’s something about Ingsoc that doesn’t seem quite right – is it the manipulation? The changing of history? The all-around sketchiness? Winston is drawn to the revolutionary ""Brotherhood"" because, well, they’re revolutionary. Eventually, Winston makes contact with O’Brien, who Winston thinks is a member of the Brotherhood, but who in actuality is a member of the Thought Police. O’Brien arranges for Winston to receive a copy of ""the book,"" a resistance manifesto which supposedly exposes the how and the why for the resistance.

Unfortunately, Winston never finds out the why. Instead, he gets tortured. But before the torturing, he and Julia are apprehended by the Thought Police. Turns out that secret hiding place wasn’t so secret after all. The happy couple is then brought to the Ministry of Love, where criminals and opponents of the Party are tortured, interrogated, and ""reintegrated"" before their release and ultimate execution. O’Brien runs the show as far as Winston’s torture sessions are concerned.

Months later, Winston is sent to Room 101, where a person is faced with his greatest fear. Rats…why did it have to be rats? Musing on the impending rats-chewing-on-his-face scenario, Winston calls out, ""Do it to Julia!"" That’s pretty much what O’Brien was looking for, so Winston gets to go back to being a happy member of the rat race. Released, Winston’s heart is filled with love for the Party. Even when he and Julia meet again by chance, they feel apathetic towards each other. The last man in Europe has been converted and destroyed. Quite the fine point there, George.

There, traditional stereotypes such as “Men have bigger brains” and women are ""naturally weak"" are countered with logic such as ""an elephant also has a bigger and heavier brain"" and “a lion is stronger than a man” and yet neither of them dominates men.[3] In Ladyland crime is eliminated, since men were considered responsible for all of it.

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.)

Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention).

We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.

Yeah, there's going to be trouble.

Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.

On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again.

Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.)

Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

Marquez's novel is very repetitive and nonlinear, so we're going to lay it down for you in a straightforward and chronological order. It's not what Marquez intended, but it sure is easier to understand.

Six months before 'the incident,' Bayardo San Román comes barging into town looking like he's the best thing since sliced bread. No one knows who he is, and the only thing they do know is that he's looking for a wife. Apparently no one in town thinks this is sketchy, so we'll roll with it too.

One day he randomly chooses Angela as his bride-to-be, despite the fact that she has no interest in him at all. His unrequited love is totally in line with his sketchy character, but everyone seems to ignore the sketch-factor because the dude's richer than Bill Gates. Anyway, Angela's lack of love for Bayardo is not the only problem. She has a secret: She's not a virgin.

Angela's impoverished family doesn't care about this fact and they basically force her into marrying Bayardo. After four months, they have the biggest wedding the town has ever seen. Everyone who's anyone (and some people who aren't even anyone) comes to the party. But it all comes crashing down on their wedding night when it's revealed that Angela is not a virgin.

Bayardo takes her back home, where Angela's mom beats her for about two hours. She tells her brothers that Santiago is the guy who deflowered her, and that's when the murder plot begins.

The next day, the town is still in a festive mood because the Bishop is supposed to visit. They even have crazy amounts of roosters prepared for his favorite cock-comb soup. So even though it's Monday, everything is not operating the way it would normally, which is unfortunate for poor Santiago.

In the hours that follow, everything that could go wrong does go wrong. It's like the darkest black comedy you've ever seen. By 6 AM everyone in town knows that the brothers are going to kill Santiago, but no one does anything. Even though the brothers don't want to kill him, no one stops them. What the heck is up with this town?

In the end, Santiago is killed at his own doorstep.

After the murder, the whole town can't stop talking about it. Angela's family leaves town and so does her husband of five hours. There's even a trial, but it doesn't seem that anything comes of it aside from some pretty cool records written in red ink.

Years later, our narrator goes around talking to the residents of the town. He tries to get some kind of truth, but we don't get anything concrete except for one sad truth: Santiago is dead.

Our lives and specifically the market are so full of random aspects and complex structures. Understanding the behaviour of markets and attributing specific reasons to its behaviour is totally impossible and sometimes a useless task. As the title explains, Taleb’s theory explains how all of us get fooled easily by randomness. Taleb goes on to elaborate how we misconstrue luck and skill. Wherever true luck plays a role, we assume it to be the work of individual skill. Most impressive situations in life are only due to luck, claims Taleb. He uses the theory of black swans (rare events) to propound his idea and says that black swans cannot be predicted.

Taleb elucidates his theory through some popular examples using people like the baseball expert Yogi Berra, the philosopher Karl Popper, the ancient wise man Solon, the financier George Soros and the Greek voyager Odysseus. Most of all, journalists and traders fall for the randomness as well. In addition to real-life examples, Taleb also brings in the case of the fictitious hero Nero, who is smart enough to understand the play of randomness in his professional life, but is superstitiously foolish.

Taleb also constructs an invincible, nameless fool who seems to be at the right place at the right time. The fool has a steady string of followers who are ready to do anything for their Guru. But, the fool’s actions cannot be imitated. His success is one obtained by chance.

The most unexpected things will happen for sure. But, we become creatures of routine that we fail to identify it when it happens. Moreover, detecting risks and accepting them is done only by the emotional part of the brain. If we understand probability, then we can perceive the role of luck in everyday situations. The trick lies in recognizing it. Taleb says we must be aware of the trap that luck sets for us.

How do we distinguish a lucky poseur from a far-sighted visionary? How do we read an incident? How do we decide whether it is luck or talent that made the person successful?

Fooled By Randomness: The Hidden Role Of Chance In The Markets And In Life received wide recognition. Fortune named it as one of the smartest books of all time and the Financial Times termed it as the Book of the Year.

Is life worth living? If life does not possess any significance when confronted with the reality of human existence, is suicide our only alternative? In the essay, Camus introduces the readers to his philosophy of the absurd where man’s futile search for meaning, unity and clarity is questioned. The author states that to realize the reason for our existence, we need to break the norms of normalcy and revolt. During the course of the book, Camus outlines numerous approaches to the absurd life. The author compares the absurdity of human life with the situation of Sisyphus, a Greek mythological figure who was condemned to forever repeat a meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain only to see it roll down again.

In a very engaging and interesting manner, the author states that humans should embrace the absurd. By embracing the absurd, it means that we accept all the unreasonable things that the world has to offer. Camus arrives at three consequences from the full acknowledgement of the absurd, revolt, freedom and passion. How then should the absurd man live? What is the purpose of life? Is suicide the answer to all the problems in life? Through a philosophical series of questioning, this book truly depicts life in a unique and refreshing manner. The book is for all those people who are interested in the philosophy of existentialism, this book will truly engage the readers till the last page.

Camus has drawn some very powerful consequences about life and mortality. Knowing the fact that one day all of us are going to die is a great liberator. Therefore traditions accepted as morals, ethics accepted as habits, all cease to be less important when we know that our time on the planet is limited. An oversimplified version of the essay is that man is only a small part of a vast and endless universe and that the most a man can do is to live their life to the fullest at every moment.

This book serves as a follow-up book to the author’s bestselling 1999 book, The Power Of Now, which promoted the idea that in order to achieve lasting happiness, human beings must learn to dissociate their thoughts from their identities. A New Earth: Create A Better Life builds extensively upon the same primary theme, exploring a different perspective this time around.

The first book had an introspective quality and focused on the spiritual needs of the individual. On the other hand, this book turns the spotlight outwards, choosing to highlight the ways in which an individual’s spiritual evolution can be instrumental in shaping humanity’s collective spiritual consciousness.

Divided into ten chapters, the book begins with a chapter on the awakening of human consciousness. The next three chapters focus on the concept of ego, exploring how attachment towards one’s thoughts, memories, and possessions can give rise to an illusory and harmful sense of self.

In the subsequent chapters, the author discusses concepts such as recurring emotional pain, the space of consciousness, and inner and outer purpose. The final chapter presents the three elements that the author considers to be collectively representative of an awakened consciousness.

A New Earth: Create A Better Life was first published in 2005 by Penguin. It went on to receive high worldwide acclaim, its popularity scaling further when it was chosen as a recommended title by Oprah Winfrey’s Book Club in 2008. This edition is a 2009 reprint by Penguin Books.

About Eckhart Tolle

Eckhart Tolle is a German-Canadian author and public speaker.

He has written books such as Guardians Of Being, A New Earth: Awakening To Your Life’s Purpose, The Power Of Now: A Guide To Spiritual Enlightenment, Oneness With All Life: Inspirational Selections from A New Earth, and Stillness Speaks: Whispers of Now.

Distinctly permeated by a highly spiritual quality, Tolle’s writing explores psychology, metaphysics, and other realms of the esoteric.

Tolle was born as Ulrich Leonard Tolle in 1948 in Germany. He had a very turbulent and disturbed childhood. With the consent of his father, he chose to study language, literature, and astronomy at home instead of attending high school. After a brief teaching stint in London, he went on to study literature, psychology, and philosophy at the University of London. After graduation, Tolle joined Cambridge University on a research scholarship. A profound inner transformation at the age of 29 saw him eventually turning into a spiritual teacher and counselor. He spreads his teachings through his company, video website, speeches, and workshops, choosing to steer clear of undue focus on commercial motivation.

The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Late Spring and Autumn Period (roughly 5th century BC). The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (""Master Sun"", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to an aspect of warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare[1] and has influenced both Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy and beyond.

This book contained a detailed explanation and analysis of the Chinese military, from weapons and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun Tzu also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Because Sun Tzu has long been considered to be one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training for centuries to come.
Chapter summary
1. Detail assessment and planning: explores the five fundamental factors (the Way, seasons, terrain, leadership, and management) and seven elements that determine the outcomes of military engagements. By thinking, assessing and comparing these points, a commander can calculate his chances of victory. Habitual deviation from these calculations will ensure failure via improper action. The text stresses that war is a very grave matter for the state and must not be commenced without due consideration.
2. Waging war : explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how success requires winning decisive engagements quickly. This section advises that successful military campaigns require limiting the cost of competition and conflict.
3. Strategic attack : defines the source of strength as unity, not size, and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war. In order of importance, these critical factors are: Attack, Strategy, Alliances, Army and Cities.
4. Disposition of the army : explains the importance of defending existing positions until a commander is capable of advancing from those positions in safety. It teaches commanders the importance of recognizing strategic opportunities, and teaches not to create opportunities for the enemy.
5. Forces : explains the use of creativity and timing in building an army's momentum.
6. Weaknesses and strengths : explains how an army's opportunities come from the openings in the environment caused by the relative weakness of the enemy and how to respond to changes in the fluid battlefield over a given area.
7. Military maneuvers : explains the dangers of direct conflict and how to win those confrontations when they are forced upon the commander.
8. Variations and adaptability : focuses on the need for flexibility in an army's responses. It explains how to respond to shifting circumstances successfully.
9. Movement and development of troops : describes the different situations in which an army finds itself as it moves through new enemy territories, and how to respond to these situations. Much of this section focuses on evaluating the intentions of others.
10. Terrain : looks at the three general areas of resistance (distance, dangers and barriers) and the six types of ground positions that arise from them. Each of these six field positions offers certain advantages and disadvantages.
11. The nine battlegrounds : describes the nine common situations (or stages) in a campaign, from scattering to deadly, and the specific focus that a commander will need in order to successfully navigate them.
12. Attacking with fire : explains the general use of weapons and the specific use of the environment as a weapon. This section examines the five targets for attack, the five types of environmental attack and the appropriate responses to such attacks.
13. Intelligence and espionage : focuses on the importance of developing good information sources, and specifies the five types of intelligence sources and how to best manage each of them.",The Art of War,Sun Tzu,John Minford, ,Penguin Books,9780140455526,"1st edition,2008",112,India,English

“Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None” is a novel by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche that was originally published in four parts between 1883 and 1891.

The novel is a philosophical treatise on Nietzsche’s ideals and his idea of the “overman”. Several of the philosopher’s most famous concepts are introduced in the novel. Including the idea that God is dead (meaning that societies old foundations are dead and that the idea of good and evil has changed) and the “eternal recurrence of the same” or the idea that time is an everlasting line and that anything that can happen has already happened and will happen again eventually.


 
Nietzsche uses the protagonist of the fifth century B.C.E. Philosopher, Zarathustra in order to tell the story. Zarathustra comes down from his mountain top cave to preach to the people about the Overman but is soon rebuked. The book is mainly comprised of Zarathustra’s lessons to the people and to himself.

Globalization has been viewed as a perfect solution for the problems of many weak and nascent economies. A globally integrated economy that allowed the free flow of capital across borders was supposed to benefit the countries that opened up their markets.

That idea has not really worked out well in many places. There is an increasing number of voices protesting against globalization policies. This book, Globalization And Its Discontents analyses the reasons for this rising opposition.

The book does not explicitly take an anti globalization stand. It just inquires into the failures of the idea in certain regions of the world. It examines the factors that contributed towards this failure. The author mainly focuses on the policies of international organizations like the IMF and the World Bank. He says that the global organizations employed a one solution fits all policy. They did not take into account the unique problems and needs of each country that they tried to help. They simply worked on the belief that a free market was the cure to all economic ills.

The author takes up the cases of South Asia and Russia to illustrate his points. He says institutions like the IMF encouraged free flow of capital even in regions without a strongly regulated financial sector. This left the field open for speculative short term investors. These investors panicked and pulled out at the slightest signs of an economic crisis. This destabilized the already weak economies of many developing countries, and whole nations went bankrupt.

The loans from IMF imposed strict conditions on the borrowing countries. These included asking the countries to cut their expenditure on public spending like food subsidies. When economies collapsed and many people lost their jobs, they did not even have a social safety net to fall back on. This led to social and political unrest in countries like Indonesia and Russia. So, the institutions that were supposed to help these countries strengthen their economies instead worsened the crisis, says the author. Globalization And Its Discontents says globalization as such is not a bad idea. It brings in global funding into poor economies and opens up new opportunities and new markets.

What is needed, says the author, are reforms in the functioning of institutions like the IMF. He says that there is need for increased transparency and accountability in these organizations.

The Metamorphosis and Other Stories, by Franz Kafka, is part of the Barnes and Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes and Noble Classics:
All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes and Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.


Virtually unknown during his lifetime, Franz Kafka is now one of the world’s most widely read and discussed authors. His nightmarish novels and short stories have come to symbolize modern man’s anxiety and alienation in a bizarre, hostile, and dehumanized world. This vision is most fully realized in Kafka’s masterpiece, “The Metamorphosis,” a story that is both harrowing and amusing, and a landmark of modern literature. 

Bringing together some of Kafka’s finest work, this collection demonstrates the richness and variety of the author’s artistry. “The Judgment,” which Kafka considered to be his decisive breakthrough, and “The Stoker,” which became the first chapter of his novel Amerika, are here included. These two, along with “The Metamorphosis,” form a suite of stories Kafka referred to as “The Sons,” and they collectively present a devastating portrait of the modern family.

Also included are “In the Penal Colony,” a story of a torture machine and its operators and victims, and “A Hunger Artist,” about the absurdity of an artist trying to communicate with a misunderstanding public. Kafka’s lucid, succinct writing chronicles the labyrinthine complexities, the futility-laden horror, and the stifling oppressiveness that permeate his vision of modern life.

Justice has multiple dimensions and cannot be defined as or decided upon in singular terms. It can mean different things to different people in different instances. It is, in simple words, understood as existing and varying on a continuum. This is the central aspect of the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen’s book, The Idea Of Justice.

This remarkable book by the distinguished economist questions the very notion of social justice being a far-fetched ideal or an achievable and practical possibility. The book defines a perfectly just society and also traces the concept of social justice as understood by philosophers and thinkers over ages. People have continued to face differences in opinions regarding what is just and what is not, and the book places special emphasis on the alternative and comparative perspectives on justice.

The author has introduced an approach to justice followed by the demands of justice, materials of justice, forms of reasoning, and public reasoning and democracy. Within the four parts the book has been divided into are chapters covering endlessly thought-provoking topics.

This book, published in 2009, is dedicated to the memory of one of Amartya Sen’s teachers, named John Rawls. Rawls wrote a book titled A Theory Of Justice, from which Sen has picked up arguments and provided a detailed evaluation of these compelling arguments. Sen has discussed the positions of justice and the situation of original position as highlighted by Rawls in his book.

This is a monumental work is a must-read for all who wish to stir their thoughts and re-think, especially in present times when the world is quivering with questions related to global justice and fairness. A masterful text, this book provides an insight into what can make societies more just rather than making it seem like an endeavour towards a mere utopian dream.",The Idea of Justice,Amartya Sen, , ,Penguin Books,9780141037851,"1st Published,2010",468,India,English

Electra portrays a young woman planning to avenge the brutal death of her father at the hands of her mother, while in Heracles the hero seeks vengeance against the evil king who has caused bloodshed in his family.

He Algebra of Infinite Justice (2001) is a collection of essays written by Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy. The book discusses several perspectives of global and local concerns, among them one being the abuse of Nuclear bomb showoffs.

The book discusses several issues from fields as diverse as the political euphoria in India over its successful nuclear bomb tests, the 'power' politics wherein she discusses the power generating companies of the world manipulating the laws and policies of the many power-deprived nations.

Introduction:

A few weeks after India detonated a thermonuclear device in 1998, Arundhati Roy wrote ‘The End of Imagination’. The essay attracted worldwide attention as the voice of a brilliant Indian writer speaking out with clarity and conscience against nuclear weapons. Over the next three and a half years, she wrote a series of political essays on a diverse range of momentous subjects: from the illusory benefits of big dams, to the downside of corporate globalization and the US Government’s war against terror. First published in 2001, The Algebra of Infinite Justice brings together all of Arundhati Roy’s political writings so far. This revised paperback edition includes two new essays, written in early 2002: ‘Democracy: Who’s She When She’s at Home’, that examines the horrific communal violence in Gujarat, and ‘War Talk: Summer Games with Nuclear Bombs’, about the threat of nuclear war in the Subcontinent.",The Algebra of Infinite Justice (Award-Winning Authors' Books),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143419280,"Edition,2017",252,India,English

An Autobiography also known as Towards The Freedom, (1936) is an autobiographical book written by the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru while he was in prison. It ran nine editions in the first year alone. He wrote the book to explore how and why he had ended up taking the path of civil disobedience that in turn led to his imprisonment.

Nehru starts his history with how his ancestors had to flee Kashmir, and then goes on to tell about his own life, with a particular emphasis on the parts of his life that had brought him to this point in time.

White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India is a tale with many levels, featuring Captain James Achilles Kirkpatrick as the protagonist. On one level, the book details the tragic romance between Kirkpatrick and Khair-un-Nissa, a Muslim noblewoman. On a different level, the story sheds light on the social, military, political, and trade aspects of 18th and 19th century India.

Captain Kirkpatrick is an ambitious soldier in the East India Company. When his eyes settle upon the beautiful Khair, the Nizam’s great-niece, the course of his life takes a new direction. Kirkpatrick soon learns that he must overcome many obstacles in order to marry Khair. Firstly, she is locked in purdah and engaged to be married to a nobleman. Secondly, as a Resident, Kirkpatrick is obligated to convert to Islam, which he hopes will make it easier for him to marry Khair. Kirkpatrick also ends up working as a double-agent, while working for the East India Company, he is actually supporting the Hyderabadis.

Apart from this love story, Dalrymple, also presents a side of history which is virtually unexplored by historians. Through memorable characters such as Hindoo Stuart and Sir David Ochterlony, the author draws readers’ attention to the concept of “white Mughals”. These are people of British descent who had adopted Indian customs, traditions, but who were also a source of embarrassment for colonial administrations. After conducting over five years of research, the author portrays a fascinating portrait about social etiquette, sexual and dismissive attitudes, and the growing racist treatment by the ruling British class towards the offspring of mixed race couples.
White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India won the 2003 Scottish Book Of the Year. In 2011, Dalrymple announced that British actor Ralph Fiennes would act and direct the movie-version of book.

Emraan Hashmi is not just a charming face or an unconventional actor. He is not just bold in his character portrayals. Hashmi, or Emmi as his family members call him, is also a father who is level-headed, unfazed and unyielding.

The Kiss of Life is about that time in Hashmi's life when his son needed him the most, the time when all his other experiences paled in comparison to the tennis ball tumour that invaded his son's kidney.

The chapters alternate between the present - the hospital wards, chemo and the shivers - and the past, where Hashmi battles his own doubts of being an actor, the ups and downs in his career, the media branding him as a serial kisser, the typecasting and so on.

Hashmi's book also has extensive research material on cancer. He talks about guidelines, a nutrition plan, hospital procedures and the will power to fight the C monster.",The Kiss of Life (How a Superhero and My Son Defeated Cancer),"Emraan Hashmi,Bilal Siddiqi", , ,Penguin Books,9780143426509,"1st Edition,2016",185,India,English

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.) 
Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention). 
We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.
Yeah, there's going to be trouble. Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.
On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again. 
Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.) 
Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

“The Starry Night” shows Sexton’s identification with another tortured and suicidal artist, Vincent van Gogh. The short, free-verse poem begins with an epigraph from one of van Gogh’s letters to his brother. “That does not keep me from having a terrible need of—shall I say the word—religion,” van Gogh wrote. “Then I go out at night to paint the stars.” Sexton used epigraphs from a variety of works to begin her poems, and the epigraphs are often of major importance, pointing to a main theme of the poem that might otherwise be overlooked. Here she is indicating that she shares not only the mental imbalance, suicidal tendencies, and artistic nature of the Dutch artist but also his unsatisfied desire for the spiritual.

When van Gogh wrote the letter to his brother, he was painting the masterpiece Starry Night on the Rhone, which is described in the poem. The painting captures the night sky in blues and blacks, with a swirl of violent orange representing the moon, and burning yellow-white stars. One would expect a peaceful scene from the title, but this painting is intensely disquieting. The movement seems to be a great rush skyward, the sleeping town beneath the sky unconscious of this spiraling of all nature toward infinity. Sexton sees this painting as a reflection of her own death wish. The dark tree at the edge of the painting is described as “black-haired”—Sexton was a brunette—and it “slips/ up like a drowned woman into the hot sky.” To make her meaning clearer, she continues, “This is how/ I want to die.”

The poem interprets the painting as presenting a nature that is animate and hostile. Nevertheless, the picture attracts the speaker, because nature’s brute force promises death, release from the burden of self. Sexton sees the central moon image in the painting as a great dragon that will suck her up into its being. She desires, she says, “to split/ from my life with no flag,/ no belly,/ no cry”—to merge silently and painlessly with the infinite. The images may suggest not a rediscovery of religion but a terrifying substitute for it. Part of the appeal of this poem lies in the vivid interpretation of the painting and in the kinship the reader sees between Sexton and van Gogh.",Starry Nights,Shobhaa De, , ,Penguin Books,9780143421313,"1st Edition,2013",315,India,English

Insiders know that besides her commitment to work and the frantic pace of her life, Shobhaa Dé's first priority in life has always been her family. Here she writes poignantly of her early years, and of her relationship with her parents and siblings, her husband and her children. Shobha De's high voltage career 'happened' in unexpected ways, starting with her unplanned entry as a teenager into the glamorous world of modeling, and moving on to her high-profile years as a magazine editor. In these avatars she keenly observed and astutely chronicled the new India— brash, affluent and ambitious. High-society hi-jinks, movie star follies, celebrity neurosis— none of these escaped her unsparing eye. And now she tells it all, just as it was, just as she saw it. In her inimitably forthright fashion, she writes of the choices she made, the decisions she took and the influences that shaped her.

One Hundred Years Of Solitude, a literary masterpiece by the Nobel Laureate, is a metaphoric mirror to Colombian history. The contemplative novel drapes the tale of the rise and fall of Macondo and magically captures the life and times of the Buendia family over seven generations.  

Summary Of The Book:
Set in a fictional town called Macondo in Northern Colombia, One Hundred Years Of Solitude begins with Jose Arcadio Buendia leaving his hometown with his wife Ursula, in search of a better life. One night during their journey, they happen to camp at a riverside where Jose dreams about a spectacular city and decides to establish one on the same riverbank. Thus, he builds Macondo and slowly shapes it into how he wants a city to be. Macondo then begins to miraculously attract unusual people and extraordinary events that make for a gripping plot. The adventurous Buendias find themselves in the middle of some of the most historically potent 
circumstances in Colombia. As the lineage stands in the face of the glory and downfall of a civilization, Marquez's lyrical magic manifests the delicate nuances of love and war, youth and senility, and passion and lust. And finally, what had started as an innocent dream of Jose, Ursula and 19 other families gradually break down and fall prey to lawless anarchy. 

One Hundred Years Of Solitude also chronicles the political and economic developments of the 19th century Colombia, such as corruption and capitalism with a touch of fiction. In a deeply touching and thought provoking non-linear narrative, Marquez paints a hundred years of history on the canvas of time. He uses his prerogative of having witnessed the wave of the Colombian revolution to graphically depict its lasting influence. He arrests in prose, the magical realism surrounding life, death, peace and the truth of mankind. 

Written originally in Spanish, One Hundred Years Of Solitude was published first in 1967. It has since been translated into 37 languages and sold more than 20 million copies worldover. A recipient of global acclaim and numerous awards, the book won Marquez his Nobel Prize in 1982.

The book starts with Greg writing about how his mother is always saying that ""friends will come and go but family is forever."" Greg doesn't believe that, since his friend, Rowley, now has a girlfriend named Abigail, continuing from the events of the last book. Ever since then, Rowley has been acting different, such as refusing to hang out with Greg and agreeing with everything Abigail says.

Greg has been getting bored without Rowley, so his mother tells him to ""branch out"" and make friends with the kids in the neighborhood. He decides to become friends with Fregley, since he could ""mold him into EXACTLY the type of friend [he] need[s]."" Greg tries to get Fregley to do funny things during lunch, and Fregley then becomes popular after the other kids find out that he can ""chew"" food with his belly button.

Greg's mother announces that her extended family will come to town for Easter. Greg then writes about some of his family members, including Meemaw, who organized egg hunts in the backyard. On Easter, the family notices through a photo album that Meemaw has hidden her diamond ring in an egg, and everyone rushes out to find it, although the search is unsuccessful.

Greg decides to join an after-school activity, and with the help of a Magic 8-Ball he found on Easter, he becomes a member of the Yearbook Club. The next day, Greg accidentally drops his Magic 8-Ball, and it breaks. Greg is called to the yearbook office to take yearbook photos of Fregley (Most Popular) and Rowley and Abigail (Cutest Couple). He then resigns from his position.

Greg throws his broken Magic 8-Ball into his grandmother's yard. At school, he learns that Rowley and Abigail have broken up. Greg wonders if he and Rowley should be friends again. He goes back to the Magic 8-Ball, hoping to get ""one last good answer,"" and finds the plastic egg with Meemaw's ring. To avoid breaking up his family, he hides the egg in his mother's closet.

Greg concludes that he has to make big decisions on his own, and reconciles with Rowley. He writes, ""I know Mom's always saying that friends come and go and family is forever, and maybe that's true. [...] I'm sure me and Rowley will get in another fight somewhere down the road and then we'll go through this drama all over again. But for now, we're good.""",Diary of a Wimpy Kid : Hard Luck,Jeff Kinney, , ,Penguin Books,9780141353074,"Edition,2016",236,India,English

The God of Small Things is the debut novel of Indian writer Arundhati Roy. It is a story about the childhood experiences of fraternal twins whose lives are destroyed by the ""Love Laws"" that lay down ""who should be loved, and how. And how much."" The book explores how the small things affect people's behavior and their lives. It won the Booker Prize in 1997.

ndian history and politics shape the plot and meaning of The God of Small Things in a variety of ways. Some of Roy's commentary is on the surface, with jokes and snippets of wisdom about political realities in India. However, the novel also examines the historical roots of these realities and develops profound insights into the ways in which human desperation and desire emerge from the confines of a firmly entrenched caste society.

The story is set in the caste society of India, at a time when members of the Untouchable Paravan or Paryan caste were not permitted to touch members of higher castes or enter their houses. The Untouchables were considered polluted beings. They had the lowliest jobs and lived in subhuman conditions. In India, the caste system was considered a way to organize society. Roy's book shows how terribly cruel such a system can be.

Along with the caste system, readers see an economic class struggle. The Ipes are considered upper class. They are factory owners, the dominating class. Mammachi and Baby Kochamma would not deign to mix with those of a lower class.

However, Roy shows other types of less evident discrimination. For example, there is religious discrimination. It is unacceptable for a Syrian Christian to marry a Hindu and vice versa, and Hindus can only marry a Hindu from the same caste. In more than one passage of the book, the reader feels Rahel's and Estha's discomfort at being half Hindu. Baby Kochamma constantly makes disparaging comments about Hindus. On the other hand, there is discomfort even between Christian denominations as is shown by Pappachi's negative reaction when Baby Kochamma converts to Catholicism.

Chacko suffers more veiled racial discrimination, as it seems his daughter also does. His English wife's parents were shocked and disapproving that their daughter would marry an Indian, no matter how well educated. Sophie, at one point, mentions to her cousins that they are all ""wog,"" while she is ""half-wog.""

The Ipes are very class-conscious and feel a need to maintain their status. Discrimination is a way of protecting their privileged position in society.",The God of Small Things (Man Booker Prize 1997),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143028574,"1st Published,2002",340,India,English

The Partition in history is a record of a point in time when the country was split apart along religious lines. It is an abstract piece of history for most people. While many books have documented the Partition and the violence surrounding it, most have focused on the social and political causes, and analyzed it as a collection of abstract data. Train To Pakistan is one of the books that focuses on the human drama, the real suffering of the people caught in the middle.
Mano Majra is a village that suddenly becomes part of a border between two countries. The population of the village is predominantly Sikh and Muslim. When news of communal riots and killings reach the village, the different communities express their support for each other and swear to defend one another. However, external influences are just waiting around the corner to disturb this idyllic harmony.
A train filled with the massacred bodies of Hindus and Sikhs arrives at Mano Majra. Slowly, passions gets stoked up, especially by the influx of refugees from the newly created Pakistan. They have tales of horror to tell, and the passions of Sikhs and Hindus of the village are stirred up.
Vested interests, including that of the village magistrate’s, stir up the flames. Hindus and Sikhs who just recently swore to stand by their Muslim neighbors now turn against them. Caught in all this are Juggut Singh and Iqbal. Juggut is a criminal, while Iqbal is a western educated intellectual who is on a mission to reform society. The common thread that binds them together is that they are both thrown into jail as suspects in a murder.
Ram Lal, a local moneylender, has been murdered. Ram Lal was a Hindu and this is used by subversive elements to incite violence against Muslims. The police, in a desperate attempt to divert attention, arrest Iqbal and Juggut.
Meanwhile, as the violence escalates, a train arrives to take the Muslim population of the village en masse to Pakistan.

Glimpses Of World History was written by Nehru in 1934, which provides the readers a panoramic sweep of history, comprising 196 letters in total. These letters were written from a number of prisons in British India from 1930 to 1933. The sole objective of these letters was to introduce Nehru’s daughter, Indira, to world history. In his first letter, Nehru tells Indira about his sadness at being unable to send her any material gift from prison. He goes on to tell her that he would give her something he could afford, which was a series of letters, straight from his heart.

Since these letters were written during his time in prison, Nehru didn’t have access to any reference books, but only his personal notes. Through the course of this book, he covers the history of mankind from 6000 BC till the time he wrote this book. He tells the readers about the rise and fall of large civilizations and empires from Rome, Greece, West Asia, and China. He also throws light on several renowned historical figures such as Genghis Khan, Vladimir Lenin, Mohandas K. Gandhi, and Ashoka. One of his chapters talks about Genghis Khan and the Mongol invasion in a way that is against major European views of that time. He mentions that Genghis was, without doubt, history’s greatest military genius and leader, considering Alexander and Caesar petty before Genghis.

He wrote about several cultures in detail, as he wasn’t in favor of the current way history was taught at school. Owing to the fact that history teaching at school revolved only around a particular country, he wrote about world history to his daughter, to help her understand why people did what they did. These letters have been written in an informal manner, packed with contemporary as well as personal experiences.

In The Outsider (1942), his classic existentialist novel, Camus explores the alienation of an individual who refuses to conform to social norms. Meursault, his anti-hero, will not lie. When his mother dies, he refuses to show his emotions simply to satisfy the expectations of others. And when he commits a random act of violence on a sun-drenched beach near Algiers, his lack of remorse compounds his guilt in the eyes of society and the law. Yet he is as much a victim as a criminal.

Albert Camus' portrayal of a man confronting the absurd, and revolting against the injustice of society, depicts the paradox of man's joy in life when faced with the 'tender indifference' of the world.

Sandra Smith's translation, based on close listening to a recording of Camus reading his work aloud on French radio in 1954, sensitively renders the subtleties and dream-like atmosphere of L'?tranger.

Albert Camus (1913-1960), French novelist, essayist and playwright, is one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. His most famous works include The Myth of Sisyphus (1942), The Plague (1947), The Just (1949), The Rebel (1951) and The Fall (1956). He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, and his last novel, The First Man, unfinished at the time of his death, appeared in print for the first time in 1994, and was published in English soon after by Hamish Hamilton.

Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is a 2012 non-fiction book written by Susan Cain. Cain argues that modern Western culture misunderstands and undervalues the traits and capabilities of introverted people, leading to ""a colossal waste of talent, energy, and happiness"".

The book presents a history of how Western culture transformed from a culture of character to a culture of personality in which an ""extrovert ideal"" dominates and introversion is viewed as inferior or even pathological. Adopting scientific definitions of introversion and extroversion as preferences for different levels of stimulation, Quiet outlines the advantages and disadvantages of each temperament, emphasizing the myth of the extrovert ideal that has dominated in the West since the early twentieth century. Asserting that temperament is a core element of human identity, Cain cites research in biology, psychology, neuroscience and evolution to demonstrate that introversion is both common and normal, noting that many of humankind's most creative individuals and distinguished leaders were introverts. Cain urges changes at the workplace, in schools, and in parenting; offers advice to introverts for functioning in an extrovert-dominated culture; and offers advice in communication, work, and relationships between people of differing temperament.",Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can not Stop Talking,Susan Cain, , ,Penguin Books,9780307352156,"1st Edition,2013",348,Abroad,English

Love in the Time of Cholera is a celebration of life over death, love over despair, and health over sickness. It is the story of Florentino Ariza, who was rejected by Fermina Daza in his youth. He maintains a silent vigil of unrequited love for fifty-one years, nine months, and four days, until he meets Fermina again at her husband’s wake and renews his suit. The novel spans a period from the late 1870’s to the early 1930’s, and it is set in a South American community modeled after Cartagena, Colombia, and besieged by civil wars and plagues.

Florentino, an eighteen-year-old apprentice telegraph operator, sees thirteen-year old Fermina and falls madly in love. Fermina’s father finds out and sends his daughter on an extended trip to remove her from temptation. She returns years later, rejects Florentino, and accepts the proposal of a cultured physician and cholera specialist, Dr. Juvenal Urbino. Although Florentino continues to love Fermina throughout the years, he also continues his own social relationships—engaging in 622 long-term liaisons, which he records in a series of notebooks—and becomes president of a riverboat company.

The story unfolds on a cold April day in 1984 in Oceania, the totalitarian superpower in post World War II Europe. Winston Smith, employed as a records (no, not vinyl) editor at the Ministry of Truth, drags himself home to Victory Mansions (nothing victorious about them) for lunch. Depressed and oppressed, he starts a journal of his rebellious thoughts against the Party. If discovered, this journal will result in his execution. Now that’s playing with fire. For the sake of added precautions, Winston only writes when safe from the view of the surveying telescreens. And when that shot of industrial grade ""Victory Gin"" kicks in.

At work, Winston becomes curious about ""the brunette"" (a.k.a. Julia), a machine-operator in the Fiction Department. Although at one time he feared that she was a member of the Thought Police, all such paranoia ends when she slips him a note reading ""I love you"" in the corridor one day. The two begin a secret love affair, first meeting up in the countryside, and then in a rented room atop Mr. Charrington’s shop in the prole district. All of these places are away from surveillance – or so they think.

As Winston and Julia fall deeper in love, Winston’s views about their government (the Party) change. There’s something about Ingsoc that doesn’t seem quite right – is it the manipulation? The changing of history? The all-around sketchiness? Winston is drawn to the revolutionary ""Brotherhood"" because, well, they’re revolutionary. Eventually, Winston makes contact with O’Brien, who Winston thinks is a member of the Brotherhood, but who in actuality is a member of the Thought Police. O’Brien arranges for Winston to receive a copy of ""the book,"" a resistance manifesto which supposedly exposes the how and the why for the resistance.

Unfortunately, Winston never finds out the why. Instead, he gets tortured. But before the torturing, he and Julia are apprehended by the Thought Police. Turns out that secret hiding place wasn’t so secret after all. The happy couple is then brought to the Ministry of Love, where criminals and opponents of the Party are tortured, interrogated, and ""reintegrated"" before their release and ultimate execution. O’Brien runs the show as far as Winston’s torture sessions are concerned.

It depicts a feminist utopia (called Ladyland) in which women run everything and men are secluded, in a mirror-image of the traditional practice of purdah. The women are aided by science fiction-esque ""electrical"" technology which enables laborless farming and flying cars; the women scientists have discovered how to trap solar power and control the weather. This results in ""a sort of gender-based Planet of the Apes where the roles are reversed and the men are locked away in a technologically advanced future.

There, traditional stereotypes such as “Men have bigger brains” and women are ""naturally weak"" are countered with logic such as ""an elephant also has a bigger and heavier brain"" and “a lion is stronger than a man” and yet neither of them dominates men.[3] In Ladyland crime is eliminated, since men were considered responsible for all of it. The workday is only two hours long, since men used to waste six hours of each day in smoking. The religion is one of love and truth.

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.)

Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention).

We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.

Yeah, there's going to be trouble.

Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.

On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again.

Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.)

Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

Marquez's novel is very repetitive and nonlinear, so we're going to lay it down for you in a straightforward and chronological order. It's not what Marquez intended, but it sure is easier to understand.

Six months before 'the incident,' Bayardo San Román comes barging into town looking like he's the best thing since sliced bread. No one knows who he is, and the only thing they do know is that he's looking for a wife. Apparently no one in town thinks this is sketchy, so we'll roll with it too.

One day he randomly chooses Angela as his bride-to-be, despite the fact that she has no interest in him at all. His unrequited love is totally in line with his sketchy character, but everyone seems to ignore the sketch-factor because the dude's richer than Bill Gates. Anyway, Angela's lack of love for Bayardo is not the only problem. She has a secret: She's not a virgin.

Angela's impoverished family doesn't care about this fact and they basically force her into marrying Bayardo. After four months, they have the biggest wedding the town has ever seen. Everyone who's anyone (and some people who aren't even anyone) comes to the party. But it all comes crashing down on their wedding night when it's revealed that Angela is not a virgin.

Bayardo takes her back home, where Angela's mom beats her for about two hours. She tells her brothers that Santiago is the guy who deflowered her, and that's when the murder plot begins.

The next day, the town is still in a festive mood because the Bishop is supposed to visit. They even have crazy amounts of roosters prepared for his favorite cock-comb soup. So even though it's Monday, everything is not operating the way it would normally, which is unfortunate for poor Santiago.

In the hours that follow, everything that could go wrong does go wrong. It's like the darkest black comedy you've ever seen. By 6 AM everyone in town knows that the brothers are going to kill Santiago, but no one does anything. Even though the brothers don't want to kill him, no one stops them. What the heck is up with this town?

In the end, Santiago is killed at his own doorstep.

After the murder, the whole town can't stop talking about it. Angela's family leaves town and so does her husband of five hours. There's even a trial, but it doesn't seem that anything comes of it aside from some pretty cool records written in red ink.

Years later, our narrator goes around talking to the residents of the town. He tries to get some kind of truth, but we don't get anything concrete except for one sad truth: Santiago is dead.

Our lives and specifically the market are so full of random aspects and complex structures. Understanding the behaviour of markets and attributing specific reasons to its behaviour is totally impossible and sometimes a useless task. As the title explains, Taleb’s theory explains how all of us get fooled easily by randomness. Taleb goes on to elaborate how we misconstrue luck and skill. Wherever true luck plays a role, we assume it to be the work of individual skill. Most impressive situations in life are only due to luck, claims Taleb. He uses the theory of black swans (rare events) to propound his idea and says that black swans cannot be predicted.

Taleb elucidates his theory through some popular examples using people like the baseball expert Yogi Berra, the philosopher Karl Popper, the ancient wise man Solon, the financier George Soros and the Greek voyager Odysseus. Most of all, journalists and traders fall for the randomness as well. In addition to real-life examples, Taleb also brings in the case of the fictitious hero Nero, who is smart enough to understand the play of randomness in his professional life, but is superstitiously foolish.

Taleb also constructs an invincible, nameless fool who seems to be at the right place at the right time. The fool has a steady string of followers who are ready to do anything for their Guru. But, the fool’s actions cannot be imitated. His success is one obtained by chance.

The most unexpected things will happen for sure. But, we become creatures of routine that we fail to identify it when it happens. Moreover, detecting risks and accepting them is done only by the emotional part of the brain. If we understand probability, then we can perceive the role of luck in everyday situations. The trick lies in recognizing it. Taleb says we must be aware of the trap that luck sets for us.

How do we distinguish a lucky poseur from a far-sighted visionary? How do we read an incident? How do we decide whether it is luck or talent that made the person successful?

Fooled By Randomness: The Hidden Role Of Chance In The Markets And In Life received wide recognition. Fortune named it as one of the smartest books of all time and the Financial Times termed it as the Book of the Year.

Is life worth living? If life does not possess any significance when confronted with the reality of human existence, is suicide our only alternative? In the essay, Camus introduces the readers to his philosophy of the absurd where man’s futile search for meaning, unity and clarity is questioned. The author states that to realize the reason for our existence, we need to break the norms of normalcy and revolt. During the course of the book, Camus outlines numerous approaches to the absurd life. The author compares the absurdity of human life with the situation of Sisyphus, a Greek mythological figure who was condemned to forever repeat a meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain only to see it roll down again.

In a very engaging and interesting manner, the author states that humans should embrace the absurd. By embracing the absurd, it means that we accept all the unreasonable things that the world has to offer. Camus arrives at three consequences from the full acknowledgement of the absurd, revolt, freedom and passion. How then should the absurd man live? What is the purpose of life? Is suicide the answer to all the problems in life? Through a philosophical series of questioning, this book truly depicts life in a unique and refreshing manner. The book is for all those people who are interested in the philosophy of existentialism, this book will truly engage the readers till the last page.

Camus has drawn some very powerful consequences about life and mortality. Knowing the fact that one day all of us are going to die is a great liberator. Therefore traditions accepted as morals, ethics accepted as habits, all cease to be less important when we know that our time on the planet is limited. An oversimplified version of the essay is that man is only a small part of a vast and endless universe and that the most a man can do is to live their life to the fullest at every moment.

The story unfolds on a cold April day in 1984 in Oceania, the totalitarian superpower in post World War II Europe. Winston Smith, employed as a records (no, not vinyl) editor at the Ministry of Truth, drags himself home to Victory Mansions (nothing victorious about them) for lunch. Depressed and oppressed, he starts a journal of his rebellious thoughts against the Party. If discovered, this journal will result in his execution. Now that’s playing with fire. For the sake of added precautions, Winston only writes when safe from the view of the surveying telescreens. And when that shot of industrial grade ""Victory Gin"" kicks in.
At work, Winston becomes curious about ""the brunette"" (a.k.a. Julia), a machine-operator in the Fiction Department. Although at one time he feared that she was a member of the Thought Police, all such paranoia ends when she slips him a note reading ""I love you"" in the corridor one day. The two begin a secret love affair, first meeting up in the countryside, and then in a rented room atop Mr. Charrington’s shop in the prole district. All of these places are away from surveillance – or so they think. 
As Winston and Julia fall deeper in love, Winston’s views about their government (the Party) change. There’s something about Ingsoc that doesn’t seem quite right – is it the manipulation? The changing of history? The all-around sketchiness? Winston is drawn to the revolutionary ""Brotherhood"" because, well, they’re revolutionary. Eventually, Winston makes contact with O’Brien, who Winston thinks is a member of the Brotherhood, but who in actuality is a member of the Thought Police. O’Brien arranges for Winston to receive a copy of ""the book,"" a resistance manifesto which supposedly exposes the how and the why for the resistance. 
Unfortunately, Winston never finds out the why. Instead, he gets tortured. But before the torturing, he and Julia are apprehended by the Thought Police. Turns out that secret hiding place wasn’t so secret after all. The happy couple is then brought to the Ministry of Love, where criminals and opponents of the Party are tortured, interrogated, and ""reintegrated"" before their release and ultimate execution. O’Brien runs the show as far as Winston’s torture sessions are concerned. 
Months later, Winston is sent to Room 101, where a person is faced with his greatest fear. Rats…why did it have to be rats?

This book serves as a follow-up book to the author’s bestselling 1999 book, The Power Of Now, which promoted the idea that in order to achieve lasting happiness, human beings must learn to dissociate their thoughts from their identities. A New Earth: Create A Better Life builds extensively upon the same primary theme, exploring a different perspective this time around.

The first book had an introspective quality and focused on the spiritual needs of the individual. On the other hand, this book turns the spotlight outwards, choosing to highlight the ways in which an individual’s spiritual evolution can be instrumental in shaping humanity’s collective spiritual consciousness.

Divided into ten chapters, the book begins with a chapter on the awakening of human consciousness. The next three chapters focus on the concept of ego, exploring how attachment towards one’s thoughts, memories, and possessions can give rise to an illusory and harmful sense of self.

In the subsequent chapters, the author discusses concepts such as recurring emotional pain, the space of consciousness, and inner and outer purpose. The final chapter presents the three elements that the author considers to be collectively representative of an awakened consciousness.

A New Earth: Create A Better Life was first published in 2005 by Penguin. It went on to receive high worldwide acclaim, its popularity scaling further when it was chosen as a recommended title by Oprah Winfrey’s Book Club in 2008. This edition is a 2009 reprint by Penguin Books.

The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Late Spring and Autumn Period (roughly 5th century BC). The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (""Master Sun"", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to an aspect of warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare[1] and has influenced both Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy and beyond.

This book contained a detailed explanation and analysis of the Chinese military, from weapons and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun Tzu also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Because Sun Tzu has long been considered to be one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training for centuries to come.
Chapter summary
1. Detail assessment and planning: explores the five fundamental factors (the Way, seasons, terrain, leadership, and management) and seven elements that determine the outcomes of military engagements. By thinking, assessing and comparing these points, a commander can calculate his chances of victory. Habitual deviation from these calculations will ensure failure via improper action. The text stresses that war is a very grave matter for the state and must not be commenced without due consideration.
2. Waging war : explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how success requires winning decisive engagements quickly. This section advises that successful military campaigns require limiting the cost of competition and conflict.
3. Strategic attack : defines the source of strength as unity, not size, and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war. In order of importance, these critical factors are: Attack, Strategy, Alliances, Army and Cities.
4. Disposition of the army : explains the importance of defending existing positions until a commander is capable of advancing from those positions in safety. It teaches commanders the importance of recognizing strategic opportunities, and teaches not to create opportunities for the enemy.
5. Forces : explains the use of creativity and timing in building an army's momentum.
6. Weaknesses and strengths : explains how an army's opportunities come from the openings in the environment caused by the relative weakness of the enemy and how to respond to changes in the fluid battlefield over a given area.
7. Military maneuvers : explains the dangers of direct conflict and how to win those confrontations when they are forced upon the commander.
8. Variations and adaptability : focuses on the need for flexibility in an army's responses. It explains how to respond to shifting circumstances successfully.
9. Movement and development of troops : describes the different situations in which an army finds itself as it moves through new enemy territories, and how to respond to these situations. Much of this section focuses on evaluating the intentions of others.
10. Terrain : looks at the three general areas of resistance (distance, dangers and barriers) and the six types of ground positions that arise from them. Each of these six field positions offers certain advantages and disadvantages.
11. The nine battlegrounds : describes the nine common situations (or stages) in a campaign, from scattering to deadly, and the specific focus that a commander will need in order to successfully navigate them.
12. Attacking with fire : explains the general use of weapons and the specific use of the environment as a weapon. This section examines the five targets for attack, the five types of environmental attack and the appropriate responses to such attacks.
13. Intelligence and espionage : focuses on the importance of developing good information sources, and specifies the five types of intelligence sources and how to best manage each of them.",The Art of War,Sun Tzu,John Minford, ,Penguin Books,9780140455526,"1st edition,2008",112,India,English

“Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None” is a novel by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche that was originally published in four parts between 1883 and 1891.

The novel is a philosophical treatise on Nietzsche’s ideals and his idea of the “overman”. Several of the philosopher’s most famous concepts are introduced in the novel. Including the idea that God is dead (meaning that societies old foundations are dead and that the idea of good and evil has changed) and the “eternal recurrence of the same” or the idea that time is an everlasting line and that anything that can happen has already happened and will happen again eventually.


 
Nietzsche uses the protagonist of the fifth century B.C.E. Philosopher, Zarathustra in order to tell the story. Zarathustra comes down from his mountain top cave to preach to the people about the Overman but is soon rebuked. The book is mainly comprised of Zarathustra’s lessons to the people and to himself. In the end, he battles his final sin: pity and sees a sign that the overman is coming.",Thus Spoke Zarathustra (Penguin Classics),Friedrich Nietzsche, , ,Penguin Books,9789380005553,"second edition,2014",416,India,English
Globalization and its Discontent,জোসেফ ই. স্টিগলিটজ্,TK. 718,"",https://rokomari.com//book/84828/globalization-and-its-discontent,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/d5cbebd6b_84828.jpg,"Summary Of The Book

Globalization has been viewed as a perfect solution for the problems of many weak and nascent economies. A globally integrated economy that allowed the free flow of capital across borders was supposed to benefit the countries that opened up their markets.

That idea has not really worked out well in many places. There is an increasing number of voices protesting against globalization policies. This book, Globalization And Its Discontents analyses the reasons for this rising opposition.

The book does not explicitly take an anti globalization stand. It just inquires into the failures of the idea in certain regions of the world. It examines the factors that contributed towards this failure. The author mainly focuses on the policies of international organizations like the IMF and the World Bank. He says that the global organizations employed a one solution fits all policy. They did not take into account the unique problems and needs of each country that they tried to help. They simply worked on the belief that a free market was the cure to all economic ills.

The author takes up the cases of South Asia and Russia to illustrate his points. He says institutions like the IMF encouraged free flow of capital even in regions without a strongly regulated financial sector. This left the field open for speculative short term investors. These investors panicked and pulled out at the slightest signs of an economic crisis. This destabilized the already weak economies of many developing countries, and whole nations went bankrupt.

The loans from IMF imposed strict conditions on the borrowing countries. These included asking the countries to cut their expenditure on public spending like food subsidies. When economies collapsed and many people lost their jobs, they did not even have a social safety net to fall back on. This led to social and political unrest in countries like Indonesia and Russia. So, the institutions that were supposed to help these countries strengthen their economies instead worsened the crisis, says the author. Globalization And Its Discontents says globalization as such is not a bad idea. It brings in global funding into poor economies and opens up new opportunities and new markets.

What is needed, says the author, are reforms in the functioning of institutions like the IMF. He says that there is need for increased transparency and accountability in these organizations.

The Metamorphosis and Other Stories, by Franz Kafka, is part of the Barnes and Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes and Noble Classics:
All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes and Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.


Virtually unknown during his lifetime, Franz Kafka is now one of the world’s most widely read and discussed authors. His nightmarish novels and short stories have come to symbolize modern man’s anxiety and alienation in a bizarre, hostile, and dehumanized world. This vision is most fully realized in Kafka’s masterpiece, “The Metamorphosis,” a story that is both harrowing and amusing, and a landmark of modern literature. 

Bringing together some of Kafka’s finest work, this collection demonstrates the richness and variety of the author’s artistry. “The Judgment,” which Kafka considered to be his decisive breakthrough, and “The Stoker,” which became the first chapter of his novel Amerika, are here included. These two, along with “The Metamorphosis,” form a suite of stories Kafka referred to as “The Sons,” and they collectively present a devastating portrait of the modern family.

Also included are “In the Penal Colony,” a story of a torture machine and its operators and victims, and “A Hunger Artist,” about the absurdity of an artist trying to communicate with a misunderstanding public. Kafka’s lucid, succinct writing chronicles the labyrinthine complexities, the futility-laden horror, and the stifling oppressiveness that permeate his vision of modern life.

Justice has multiple dimensions and cannot be defined as or decided upon in singular terms. It can mean different things to different people in different instances. It is, in simple words, understood as existing and varying on a continuum. This is the central aspect of the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen’s book, The Idea Of Justice.

This remarkable book by the distinguished economist questions the very notion of social justice being a far-fetched ideal or an achievable and practical possibility. The book defines a perfectly just society and also traces the concept of social justice as understood by philosophers and thinkers over ages. People have continued to face differences in opinions regarding what is just and what is not, and the book places special emphasis on the alternative and comparative perspectives on justice.

The author has introduced an approach to justice followed by the demands of justice, materials of justice, forms of reasoning, and public reasoning and democracy. Within the four parts the book has been divided into are chapters covering endlessly thought-provoking topics.

This book, published in 2009, is dedicated to the memory of one of Amartya Sen’s teachers, named John Rawls. Rawls wrote a book titled A Theory Of Justice, from which Sen has picked up arguments and provided a detailed evaluation of these compelling arguments. Sen has discussed the positions of justice and the situation of original position as highlighted by Rawls in his book.

This is a monumental work is a must-read for all who wish to stir their thoughts and re-think, especially in present times when the world is quivering with questions related to global justice and fairness. A masterful text, this book provides an insight into what can make societies more just rather than making it seem like an endeavour towards a mere utopian dream.",The Idea of Justice,Amartya Sen, , ,Penguin Books,9780141037851,"1st Published,2010",468,India,English

The first playwright to depict suffering without reference to the gods, Euripides (484-407 BC) made his characters speak in human terms and face the consequences of their actions. In Medea, a woman rejected by her lover takes hideous revenge by murdering the children they both love, and Hecabe depicts the former queen of Troy, driven mad by the prospect of her daughter's sacrifice to Achilles. Electra portrays a young woman planning to avenge the brutal death of her father at the hands of her mother, while in Heracles the hero seeks vengeance against the evil king who has caused bloodshed in his family.

He Algebra of Infinite Justice (2001) is a collection of essays written by Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy. The book discusses several perspectives of global and local concerns, among them one being the abuse of Nuclear bomb showoffs.

The book discusses several issues from fields as diverse as the political euphoria in India over its successful nuclear bomb tests, the 'power' politics wherein she discusses the power generating companies of the world manipulating the laws and policies of the many power-deprived nations.

Introduction:

A few weeks after India detonated a thermonuclear device in 1998, Arundhati Roy wrote ‘The End of Imagination’. The essay attracted worldwide attention as the voice of a brilliant Indian writer speaking out with clarity and conscience against nuclear weapons. Over the next three and a half years, she wrote a series of political essays on a diverse range of momentous subjects: from the illusory benefits of big dams, to the downside of corporate globalization and the US Government’s war against terror. First published in 2001, The Algebra of Infinite Justice brings together all of Arundhati Roy’s political writings so far. This revised paperback edition includes two new essays, written in early 2002: ‘Democracy: Who’s She When She’s at Home’, that examines the horrific communal violence in Gujarat, and ‘War Talk: Summer Games with Nuclear Bombs’, about the threat of nuclear war in the Subcontinent.",The Algebra of Infinite Justice (Award-Winning Authors' Books),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143419280,"Edition,2017",252,India,English

White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India is a tale with many levels, featuring Captain James Achilles Kirkpatrick as the protagonist. On one level, the book details the tragic romance between Kirkpatrick and Khair-un-Nissa, a Muslim noblewoman. On a different level, the story sheds light on the social, military, political, and trade aspects of 18th and 19th century India.

Captain Kirkpatrick is an ambitious soldier in the East India Company. When his eyes settle upon the beautiful Khair, the Nizam’s great-niece, the course of his life takes a new direction. Kirkpatrick soon learns that he must overcome many obstacles in order to marry Khair. Firstly, she is locked in purdah and engaged to be married to a nobleman. Secondly, as a Resident, Kirkpatrick is obligated to convert to Islam, which he hopes will make it easier for him to marry Khair. Kirkpatrick also ends up working as a double-agent, while working for the East India Company, he is actually supporting the Hyderabadis.

Apart from this love story, Dalrymple, also presents a side of history which is virtually unexplored by historians. Through memorable characters such as Hindoo Stuart and Sir David Ochterlony, the author draws readers’ attention to the concept of “white Mughals”. These are people of British descent who had adopted Indian customs, traditions, but who were also a source of embarrassment for colonial administrations. After conducting over five years of research, the author portrays a fascinating portrait about social etiquette, sexual and dismissive attitudes, and the growing racist treatment by the ruling British class towards the offspring of mixed race couples.
White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India won the 2003 Scottish Book Of the Year. In 2011, Dalrymple announced that British actor Ralph Fiennes would act and direct the movie-version of book.

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.) 
Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention). 
We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.
Yeah, there's going to be trouble. Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.
On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again. 
Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.) 
Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

“The Starry Night” shows Sexton’s identification with another tortured and suicidal artist, Vincent van Gogh. The short, free-verse poem begins with an epigraph from one of van Gogh’s letters to his brother. “That does not keep me from having a terrible need of—shall I say the word—religion,” van Gogh wrote. “Then I go out at night to paint the stars.” Sexton used epigraphs from a variety of works to begin her poems, and the epigraphs are often of major importance, pointing to a main theme of the poem that might otherwise be overlooked. Here she is indicating that she shares not only the mental imbalance, suicidal tendencies, and artistic nature of the Dutch artist but also his unsatisfied desire for the spiritual.

When van Gogh wrote the letter to his brother, he was painting the masterpiece Starry Night on the Rhone, which is described in the poem. The painting captures the night sky in blues and blacks, with a swirl of violent orange representing the moon, and burning yellow-white stars. One would expect a peaceful scene from the title, but this painting is intensely disquieting. The movement seems to be a great rush skyward, the sleeping town beneath the sky unconscious of this spiraling of all nature toward infinity. Sexton sees this painting as a reflection of her own death wish. The dark tree at the edge of the painting is described as “black-haired”—Sexton was a brunette—and it “slips/ up like a drowned woman into the hot sky.” To make her meaning clearer, she continues, “This is how/ I want to die.”

The poem interprets the painting as presenting a nature that is animate and hostile. Nevertheless, the picture attracts the speaker, because nature’s brute force promises death, release from the burden of self. Sexton sees the central moon image in the painting as a great dragon that will suck her up into its being. She desires, she says, “to split/ from my life with no flag,/ no belly,/ no cry”—to merge silently and painlessly with the infinite. The images may suggest not a rediscovery of religion but a terrifying substitute for it. Part of the appeal of this poem lies in the vivid interpretation of the painting and in the kinship the reader sees between Sexton and van Gogh.",Starry Nights,Shobhaa De, , ,Penguin Books,9780143421313,"1st Edition,2013",315,India,English

Insiders know that besides her commitment to work and the frantic pace of her life, Shobhaa Dé's first priority in life has always been her family. Here she writes poignantly of her early years, and of her relationship with her parents and siblings, her husband and her children. Shobha De's high voltage career 'happened' in unexpected ways, starting with her unplanned entry as a teenager into the glamorous world of modeling, and moving on to her high-profile years as a magazine editor. In these avatars she keenly observed and astutely chronicled the new India— brash, affluent and ambitious. High-society hi-jinks, movie star follies, celebrity neurosis— none of these escaped her unsparing eye. And now she tells it all, just as it was, just as she saw it. In her inimitably forthright fashion, she writes of the choices she made, the decisions she took and the influences that shaped her.

One Hundred Years Of Solitude, a literary masterpiece by the Nobel Laureate, is a metaphoric mirror to Colombian history. The contemplative novel drapes the tale of the rise and fall of Macondo and magically captures the life and times of the Buendia family over seven generations.  

Summary Of The Book:
Set in a fictional town called Macondo in Northern Colombia, One Hundred Years Of Solitude begins with Jose Arcadio Buendia leaving his hometown with his wife Ursula, in search of a better life. One night during their journey, they happen to camp at a riverside where Jose dreams about a spectacular city and decides to establish one on the same riverbank. Thus, he builds Macondo and slowly shapes it into how he wants a city to be. Macondo then begins to miraculously attract unusual people and extraordinary events that make for a gripping plot. The adventurous Buendias find themselves in the middle of some of the most historically potent 
circumstances in Colombia. As the lineage stands in the face of the glory and downfall of a civilization, Marquez's lyrical magic manifests the delicate nuances of love and war, youth and senility, and passion and lust. And finally, what had started as an innocent dream of Jose, Ursula and 19 other families gradually break down and fall prey to lawless anarchy. 

One Hundred Years Of Solitude also chronicles the political and economic developments of the 19th century Colombia, such as corruption and capitalism with a touch of fiction. In a deeply touching and thought provoking non-linear narrative, Marquez paints a hundred years of history on the canvas of time. He uses his prerogative of having witnessed the wave of the Colombian revolution to graphically depict its lasting influence. He arrests in prose, the magical realism surrounding life, death, peace and the truth of mankind. 

Written originally in Spanish, One Hundred Years Of Solitude was published first in 1967. It has since been translated into 37 languages and sold more than 20 million copies worldover. A recipient of global acclaim and numerous awards, the book won Marquez his Nobel Prize in 1982.

The book starts with Greg writing about how his mother is always saying that ""friends will come and go but family is forever."" Greg doesn't believe that, since his friend, Rowley, now has a girlfriend named Abigail, continuing from the events of the last book. Ever since then, Rowley has been acting different, such as refusing to hang out with Greg and agreeing with everything Abigail says.

Greg has been getting bored without Rowley, so his mother tells him to ""branch out"" and make friends with the kids in the neighborhood. He decides to become friends with Fregley, since he could ""mold him into EXACTLY the type of friend [he] need[s]."" Greg tries to get Fregley to do funny things during lunch, and Fregley then becomes popular after the other kids find out that he can ""chew"" food with his belly button.

Greg's mother announces that her extended family will come to town for Easter. Greg then writes about some of his family members, including Meemaw, who organized egg hunts in the backyard. On Easter, the family notices through a photo album that Meemaw has hidden her diamond ring in an egg, and everyone rushes out to find it, although the search is unsuccessful.

Greg decides to join an after-school activity, and with the help of a Magic 8-Ball he found on Easter, he becomes a member of the Yearbook Club. The next day, Greg accidentally drops his Magic 8-Ball, and it breaks. Greg is called to the yearbook office to take yearbook photos of Fregley (Most Popular) and Rowley and Abigail (Cutest Couple). He then resigns from his position.

Greg throws his broken Magic 8-Ball into his grandmother's yard. At school, he learns that Rowley and Abigail have broken up. Greg wonders if he and Rowley should be friends again. He goes back to the Magic 8-Ball, hoping to get ""one last good answer,"" and finds the plastic egg with Meemaw's ring. To avoid breaking up his family, he hides the egg in his mother's closet.

Greg concludes that he has to make big decisions on his own, and reconciles with Rowley. He writes, ""I know Mom's always saying that friends come and go and family is forever, and maybe that's true. [...] I'm sure me and Rowley will get in another fight somewhere down the road and then we'll go through this drama all over again. But for now, we're good.""",Diary of a Wimpy Kid : Hard Luck,Jeff Kinney, , ,Penguin Books,9780141353074,"Edition,2016",236,India,English

The God of Small Things is the debut novel of Indian writer Arundhati Roy. It is a story about the childhood experiences of fraternal twins whose lives are destroyed by the ""Love Laws"" that lay down ""who should be loved, and how. And how much."" The book explores how the small things affect people's behavior and their lives. It won the Booker Prize in 1997.

ndian history and politics shape the plot and meaning of The God of Small Things in a variety of ways. Some of Roy's commentary is on the surface, with jokes and snippets of wisdom about political realities in India. However, the novel also examines the historical roots of these realities and develops profound insights into the ways in which human desperation and desire emerge from the confines of a firmly entrenched caste society.

The story is set in the caste society of India, at a time when members of the Untouchable Paravan or Paryan caste were not permitted to touch members of higher castes or enter their houses. The Untouchables were considered polluted beings. They had the lowliest jobs and lived in subhuman conditions. In India, the caste system was considered a way to organize society. Roy's book shows how terribly cruel such a system can be.

Along with the caste system, readers see an economic class struggle. The Ipes are considered upper class. They are factory owners, the dominating class. Mammachi and Baby Kochamma would not deign to mix with those of a lower class.

However, Roy shows other types of less evident discrimination. For example, there is religious discrimination. It is unacceptable for a Syrian Christian to marry a Hindu and vice versa, and Hindus can only marry a Hindu from the same caste. In more than one passage of the book, the reader feels Rahel's and Estha's discomfort at being half Hindu. Baby Kochamma constantly makes disparaging comments about Hindus. On the other hand, there is discomfort even between Christian denominations as is shown by Pappachi's negative reaction when Baby Kochamma converts to Catholicism.

Chacko suffers more veiled racial discrimination, as it seems his daughter also does. His English wife's parents were shocked and disapproving that their daughter would marry an Indian, no matter how well educated. Sophie, at one point, mentions to her cousins that they are all ""wog,"" while she is ""half-wog.""

The Ipes are very class-conscious and feel a need to maintain their status. Discrimination is a way of protecting their privileged position in society.",The God of Small Things (Man Booker Prize 1997),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143028574,"1st Published,2002",340,India,English

The Partition in history is a record of a point in time when the country was split apart along religious lines. It is an abstract piece of history for most people. While many books have documented the Partition and the violence surrounding it, most have focused on the social and political causes, and analyzed it as a collection of abstract data. Train To Pakistan is one of the books that focuses on the human drama, the real suffering of the people caught in the middle.
Mano Majra is a village that suddenly becomes part of a border between two countries. The population of the village is predominantly Sikh and Muslim. When news of communal riots and killings reach the village, the different communities express their support for each other and swear to defend one another. However, external influences are just waiting around the corner to disturb this idyllic harmony.
A train filled with the massacred bodies of Hindus and Sikhs arrives at Mano Majra. Slowly, passions gets stoked up, especially by the influx of refugees from the newly created Pakistan. They have tales of horror to tell, and the passions of Sikhs and Hindus of the village are stirred up.
Vested interests, including that of the village magistrate’s, stir up the flames. Hindus and Sikhs who just recently swore to stand by their Muslim neighbors now turn against them. Caught in all this are Juggut Singh and Iqbal. Juggut is a criminal, while Iqbal is a western educated intellectual who is on a mission to reform society. The common thread that binds them together is that they are both thrown into jail as suspects in a murder.
Ram Lal, a local moneylender, has been murdered. Ram Lal was a Hindu and this is used by subversive elements to incite violence against Muslims. The police, in a desperate attempt to divert attention, arrest Iqbal and Juggut.
Meanwhile, as the violence escalates, a train arrives to take the Muslim population of the village en masse to Pakistan.

Glimpses Of World History was written by Nehru in 1934, which provides the readers a panoramic sweep of history, comprising 196 letters in total. These letters were written from a number of prisons in British India from 1930 to 1933. The sole objective of these letters was to introduce Nehru’s daughter, Indira, to world history. In his first letter, Nehru tells Indira about his sadness at being unable to send her any material gift from prison. He goes on to tell her that he would give her something he could afford, which was a series of letters, straight from his heart.

Since these letters were written during his time in prison, Nehru didn’t have access to any reference books, but only his personal notes. Through the course of this book, he covers the history of mankind from 6000 BC till the time he wrote this book. He tells the readers about the rise and fall of large civilizations and empires from Rome, Greece, West Asia, and China. He also throws light on several renowned historical figures such as Genghis Khan, Vladimir Lenin, Mohandas K. Gandhi, and Ashoka. One of his chapters talks about Genghis Khan and the Mongol invasion in a way that is against major European views of that time. He mentions that Genghis was, without doubt, history’s greatest military genius and leader, considering Alexander and Caesar petty before Genghis.

He wrote about several cultures in detail, as he wasn’t in favor of the current way history was taught at school. Owing to the fact that history teaching at school revolved only around a particular country, he wrote about world history to his daughter, to help her understand why people did what they did. These letters have been written in an informal manner, packed with contemporary as well as personal experiences.

In The Outsider (1942), his classic existentialist novel, Camus explores the alienation of an individual who refuses to conform to social norms. Meursault, his anti-hero, will not lie. When his mother dies, he refuses to show his emotions simply to satisfy the expectations of others. And when he commits a random act of violence on a sun-drenched beach near Algiers, his lack of remorse compounds his guilt in the eyes of society and the law. Yet he is as much a victim as a criminal.

Albert Camus' portrayal of a man confronting the absurd, and revolting against the injustice of society, depicts the paradox of man's joy in life when faced with the 'tender indifference' of the world.

Sandra Smith's translation, based on close listening to a recording of Camus reading his work aloud on French radio in 1954, sensitively renders the subtleties and dream-like atmosphere of L'?tranger.

Albert Camus (1913-1960), French novelist, essayist and playwright, is one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. His most famous works include The Myth of Sisyphus (1942), The Plague (1947), The Just (1949), The Rebel (1951) and The Fall (1956). He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, and his last novel, The First Man, unfinished at the time of his death, appeared in print for the first time in 1994, and was published in English soon after by Hamish Hamilton.

Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is a 2012 non-fiction book written by Susan Cain. Cain argues that modern Western culture misunderstands and undervalues the traits and capabilities of introverted people, leading to ""a colossal waste of talent, energy, and happiness"".

The book presents a history of how Western culture transformed from a culture of character to a culture of personality in which an ""extrovert ideal"" dominates and introversion is viewed as inferior or even pathological. Adopting scientific definitions of introversion and extroversion as preferences for different levels of stimulation, Quiet outlines the advantages and disadvantages of each temperament, emphasizing the myth of the extrovert ideal that has dominated in the West since the early twentieth century. Asserting that temperament is a core element of human identity, Cain cites research in biology, psychology, neuroscience and evolution to demonstrate that introversion is both common and normal, noting that many of humankind's most creative individuals and distinguished leaders were introverts. Cain urges changes at the workplace, in schools, and in parenting; offers advice to introverts for functioning in an extrovert-dominated culture; and offers advice in communication, work, and relationships between people of differing temperament.",Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can not Stop Talking,Susan Cain, , ,Penguin Books,9780307352156,"1st Edition,2013",348,Abroad,English

Love in the Time of Cholera is a celebration of life over death, love over despair, and health over sickness. It is the story of Florentino Ariza, who was rejected by Fermina Daza in his youth. He maintains a silent vigil of unrequited love for fifty-one years, nine months, and four days, until he meets Fermina again at her husband’s wake and renews his suit. The novel spans a period from the late 1870’s to the early 1930’s, and it is set in a South American community modeled after Cartagena, Colombia, and besieged by civil wars and plagues.

Florentino, an eighteen-year-old apprentice telegraph operator, sees thirteen-year old Fermina and falls madly in love. Fermina’s father finds out and sends his daughter on an extended trip to remove her from temptation. She returns years later, rejects Florentino, and accepts the proposal of a cultured physician and cholera specialist, Dr. Juvenal Urbino. Although Florentino continues to love Fermina throughout the years, he also continues his own social relationships—engaging in 622 long-term liaisons, which he records in a series of notebooks—and becomes president of a riverboat company. Then Florentino learns that eighty-one-year-old Juvenal has died, falling off a ladder trying to capture a condescending, bilingual parrot.

Land of Two Rivers: A History of Bengal provides an incisive look into the history of Bengal, one of the most fascinating and influential regions in the Indian subcontinent. Located at the confluence of two major rivers, Ganga and Brahmaputra, Bengal has been the center of trade, learning and the arts for the longest time. In the medieval era, the rise of Muslim dynasties in Bengal brought into being a unique culture which was very different from that of northern India. The British colonization in the 18th century further transformed the social and economic structure of the region. In this book, the author traces the formation of Bengali identity through the Bengal Renaissance, the growth of nationalist politics and partition of Bengal in 1947. This book will make for an engaging and informative read for those interested in the history of Bengal.

The story unfolds on a cold April day in 1984 in Oceania, the totalitarian superpower in post World War II Europe. Winston Smith, employed as a records (no, not vinyl) editor at the Ministry of Truth, drags himself home to Victory Mansions (nothing victorious about them) for lunch. Depressed and oppressed, he starts a journal of his rebellious thoughts against the Party. If discovered, this journal will result in his execution. Now that’s playing with fire. For the sake of added precautions, Winston only writes when safe from the view of the surveying telescreens. And when that shot of industrial grade ""Victory Gin"" kicks in.

At work, Winston becomes curious about ""the brunette"" (a.k.a. Julia), a machine-operator in the Fiction Department. Although at one time he feared that she was a member of the Thought Police, all such paranoia ends when she slips him a note reading ""I love you"" in the corridor one day. The two begin a secret love affair, first meeting up in the countryside, and then in a rented room atop Mr. Charrington’s shop in the prole district. All of these places are away from surveillance – or so they think.

As Winston and Julia fall deeper in love, Winston’s views about their government (the Party) change. There’s something about Ingsoc that doesn’t seem quite right – is it the manipulation? The changing of history? The all-around sketchiness? Winston is drawn to the revolutionary ""Brotherhood"" because, well, they’re revolutionary. Eventually, Winston makes contact with O’Brien, who Winston thinks is a member of the Brotherhood, but who in actuality is a member of the Thought Police. O’Brien arranges for Winston to receive a copy of ""the book,"" a resistance manifesto which supposedly exposes the how and the why for the resistance.

Unfortunately, Winston never finds out the why. Instead, he gets tortured. But before the torturing, he and Julia are apprehended by the Thought Police. Turns out that secret hiding place wasn’t so secret after all. The happy couple is then brought to the Ministry of Love, where criminals and opponents of the Party are tortured, interrogated, and ""reintegrated"" before their release and ultimate execution. O’Brien runs the show as far as Winston’s torture sessions are concerned.

Months later, Winston is sent to Room 101, where a person is faced with his greatest fear. Rats…why did it have to be rats? Musing on the impending rats-chewing-on-his-face scenario, Winston calls out, ""Do it to Julia!"" That’s pretty much what O’Brien was looking for, so Winston gets to go back to being a happy member of the rat race. Released, Winston’s heart is filled with love for the Party. Even when he and Julia meet again by chance, they feel apathetic towards each other. The last man in Europe has been converted and destroyed. Quite the fine point there, George.

This results in ""a sort of gender-based Planet of the Apes where the roles are reversed and the men are locked away in a technologically advanced future.

There, traditional stereotypes such as “Men have bigger brains” and women are ""naturally weak"" are countered with logic such as ""an elephant also has a bigger and heavier brain"" and “a lion is stronger than a man” and yet neither of them dominates men.[3] In Ladyland crime is eliminated, since men were considered responsible for all of it. The workday is only two hours long, since men used to waste six hours of each day in smoking. The religion is one of love and truth.

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.)

Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention).

We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.

Yeah, there's going to be trouble.

Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.

On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again.

Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.)

Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

Marquez's novel is very repetitive and nonlinear, so we're going to lay it down for you in a straightforward and chronological order. It's not what Marquez intended, but it sure is easier to understand.

Six months before 'the incident,' Bayardo San Román comes barging into town looking like he's the best thing since sliced bread. No one knows who he is, and the only thing they do know is that he's looking for a wife. Apparently no one in town thinks this is sketchy, so we'll roll with it too.

One day he randomly chooses Angela as his bride-to-be, despite the fact that she has no interest in him at all. His unrequited love is totally in line with his sketchy character, but everyone seems to ignore the sketch-factor because the dude's richer than Bill Gates. Anyway, Angela's lack of love for Bayardo is not the only problem. She has a secret: She's not a virgin.

Angela's impoverished family doesn't care about this fact and they basically force her into marrying Bayardo. After four months, they have the biggest wedding the town has ever seen. Everyone who's anyone (and some people who aren't even anyone) comes to the party. But it all comes crashing down on their wedding night when it's revealed that Angela is not a virgin.

Bayardo takes her back home, where Angela's mom beats her for about two hours. She tells her brothers that Santiago is the guy who deflowered her, and that's when the murder plot begins.

The next day, the town is still in a festive mood because the Bishop is supposed to visit. They even have crazy amounts of roosters prepared for his favorite cock-comb soup. So even though it's Monday, everything is not operating the way it would normally, which is unfortunate for poor Santiago.

In the hours that follow, everything that could go wrong does go wrong. It's like the darkest black comedy you've ever seen. By 6 AM everyone in town knows that the brothers are going to kill Santiago, but no one does anything. Even though the brothers don't want to kill him, no one stops them. What the heck is up with this town?

In the end, Santiago is killed at his own doorstep.

After the murder, the whole town can't stop talking about it. Angela's family leaves town and so does her husband of five hours. There's even a trial, but it doesn't seem that anything comes of it aside from some pretty cool records written in red ink.

Our lives and specifically the market are so full of random aspects and complex structures. Understanding the behaviour of markets and attributing specific reasons to its behaviour is totally impossible and sometimes a useless task. As the title explains, Taleb’s theory explains how all of us get fooled easily by randomness. Taleb goes on to elaborate how we misconstrue luck and skill. Wherever true luck plays a role, we assume it to be the work of individual skill. Most impressive situations in life are only due to luck, claims Taleb. He uses the theory of black swans (rare events) to propound his idea and says that black swans cannot be predicted.

Taleb elucidates his theory through some popular examples using people like the baseball expert Yogi Berra, the philosopher Karl Popper, the ancient wise man Solon, the financier George Soros and the Greek voyager Odysseus. Most of all, journalists and traders fall for the randomness as well. In addition to real-life examples, Taleb also brings in the case of the fictitious hero Nero, who is smart enough to understand the play of randomness in his professional life, but is superstitiously foolish.

Taleb also constructs an invincible, nameless fool who seems to be at the right place at the right time. The fool has a steady string of followers who are ready to do anything for their Guru. But, the fool’s actions cannot be imitated. His success is one obtained by chance.

The most unexpected things will happen for sure. But, we become creatures of routine that we fail to identify it when it happens. Moreover, detecting risks and accepting them is done only by the emotional part of the brain. If we understand probability, then we can perceive the role of luck in everyday situations. The trick lies in recognizing it. Taleb says we must be aware of the trap that luck sets for us.

How do we distinguish a lucky poseur from a far-sighted visionary? How do we read an incident? How do we decide whether it is luck or talent that made the person successful?

Fooled By Randomness: The Hidden Role Of Chance In The Markets And In Life received wide recognition. Fortune named it as one of the smartest books of all time and the Financial Times termed it as the Book of the Year.

Is life worth living? If life does not possess any significance when confronted with the reality of human existence, is suicide our only alternative? In the essay, Camus introduces the readers to his philosophy of the absurd where man’s futile search for meaning, unity and clarity is questioned. The author states that to realize the reason for our existence, we need to break the norms of normalcy and revolt. During the course of the book, Camus outlines numerous approaches to the absurd life. The author compares the absurdity of human life with the situation of Sisyphus, a Greek mythological figure who was condemned to forever repeat a meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain only to see it roll down again.

In a very engaging and interesting manner, the author states that humans should embrace the absurd. By embracing the absurd, it means that we accept all the unreasonable things that the world has to offer. Camus arrives at three consequences from the full acknowledgement of the absurd, revolt, freedom and passion. How then should the absurd man live? What is the purpose of life? Is suicide the answer to all the problems in life? Through a philosophical series of questioning, this book truly depicts life in a unique and refreshing manner. The book is for all those people who are interested in the philosophy of existentialism, this book will truly engage the readers till the last page.

Camus has drawn some very powerful consequences about life and mortality. Knowing the fact that one day all of us are going to die is a great liberator. Therefore traditions accepted as morals, ethics accepted as habits, all cease to be less important when we know that our time on the planet is limited. An oversimplified version of the essay is that man is only a small part of a vast and endless universe and that the most a man can do is to live their life to the fullest at every moment.

The story unfolds on a cold April day in 1984 in Oceania, the totalitarian superpower in post World War II Europe. Winston Smith, employed as a records (no, not vinyl) editor at the Ministry of Truth, drags himself home to Victory Mansions (nothing victorious about them) for lunch. Depressed and oppressed, he starts a journal of his rebellious thoughts against the Party. If discovered, this journal will result in his execution. Now that’s playing with fire. For the sake of added precautions, Winston only writes when safe from the view of the surveying telescreens. And when that shot of industrial grade ""Victory Gin"" kicks in.
At work, Winston becomes curious about ""the brunette"" (a.k.a. Julia), a machine-operator in the Fiction Department. Although at one time he feared that she was a member of the Thought Police, all such paranoia ends when she slips him a note reading ""I love you"" in the corridor one day. The two begin a secret love affair, first meeting up in the countryside, and then in a rented room atop Mr. Charrington’s shop in the prole district. All of these places are away from surveillance – or so they think. 
As Winston and Julia fall deeper in love, Winston’s views about their government (the Party) change. There’s something about Ingsoc that doesn’t seem quite right – is it the manipulation? The changing of history? The all-around sketchiness? Winston is drawn to the revolutionary ""Brotherhood"" because, well, they’re revolutionary. Eventually, Winston makes contact with O’Brien, who Winston thinks is a member of the Brotherhood, but who in actuality is a member of the Thought Police. O’Brien arranges for Winston to receive a copy of ""the book,"" a resistance manifesto which supposedly exposes the how and the why for the resistance. 
Unfortunately, Winston never finds out the why. Instead, he gets tortured. But before the torturing, he and Julia are apprehended by the Thought Police. Turns out that secret hiding place wasn’t so secret after all. The happy couple is then brought to the Ministry of Love, where criminals and opponents of the Party are tortured, interrogated, and ""reintegrated"" before their release and ultimate execution. O’Brien runs the show as far as Winston’s torture sessions are concerned. 
Months later, Winston is sent to Room 101, where a person is faced with his greatest fear. Rats…why did it have to be rats? Musing on the impending rats-chewing-on-his-face scenario, Winston calls out, ""Do it to Julia!"" That’s pretty much what O’Brien was looking for, so Winston gets to go back to being a happy member of the rat race. Released, Winston’s heart is filled with love for the Party. Even when he and Julia meet again by chance, they feel apathetic towards each other. The last man in Europe has been converted and destroyed. Quite the fine point there, George.

This book serves as a follow-up book to the author’s bestselling 1999 book, The Power Of Now, which promoted the idea that in order to achieve lasting happiness, human beings must learn to dissociate their thoughts from their identities. A New Earth: Create A Better Life builds extensively upon the same primary theme, exploring a different perspective this time around.

The first book had an introspective quality and focused on the spiritual needs of the individual. On the other hand, this book turns the spotlight outwards, choosing to highlight the ways in which an individual’s spiritual evolution can be instrumental in shaping humanity’s collective spiritual consciousness.

Divided into ten chapters, the book begins with a chapter on the awakening of human consciousness. The next three chapters focus on the concept of ego, exploring how attachment towards one’s thoughts, memories, and possessions can give rise to an illusory and harmful sense of self.

In the subsequent chapters, the author discusses concepts such as recurring emotional pain, the space of consciousness, and inner and outer purpose. The final chapter presents the three elements that the author considers to be collectively representative of an awakened consciousness.

A New Earth: Create A Better Life was first published in 2005 by Penguin. It went on to receive high worldwide acclaim, its popularity scaling further when it was chosen as a recommended title by Oprah Winfrey’s Book Club in 2008. This edition is a 2009 reprint by Penguin Books.

The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Late Spring and Autumn Period (roughly 5th century BC). The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (""Master Sun"", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to an aspect of warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare[1] and has influenced both Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy and beyond.

This book contained a detailed explanation and analysis of the Chinese military, from weapons and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun Tzu also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Because Sun Tzu has long been considered to be one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training for centuries to come.
Chapter summary
1. Detail assessment and planning: explores the five fundamental factors (the Way, seasons, terrain, leadership, and management) and seven elements that determine the outcomes of military engagements. By thinking, assessing and comparing these points, a commander can calculate his chances of victory. Habitual deviation from these calculations will ensure failure via improper action. The text stresses that war is a very grave matter for the state and must not be commenced without due consideration.
2. Waging war : explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how success requires winning decisive engagements quickly. This section advises that successful military campaigns require limiting the cost of competition and conflict.
3. Strategic attack : defines the source of strength as unity, not size, and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war. In order of importance, these critical factors are: Attack, Strategy, Alliances, Army and Cities.
4. Disposition of the army : explains the importance of defending existing positions until a commander is capable of advancing from those positions in safety. It teaches commanders the importance of recognizing strategic opportunities, and teaches not to create opportunities for the enemy.
5. Forces : explains the use of creativity and timing in building an army's momentum.
6. Weaknesses and strengths : explains how an army's opportunities come from the openings in the environment caused by the relative weakness of the enemy and how to respond to changes in the fluid battlefield over a given area.
7. Military maneuvers : explains the dangers of direct conflict and how to win those confrontations when they are forced upon the commander.
8. Variations and adaptability : focuses on the need for flexibility in an army's responses. It explains how to respond to shifting circumstances successfully.
9. Movement and development of troops : describes the different situations in which an army finds itself as it moves through new enemy territories, and how to respond to these situations. Much of this section focuses on evaluating the intentions of others.
10. Terrain : looks at the three general areas of resistance (distance, dangers and barriers) and the six types of ground positions that arise from them. Each of these six field positions offers certain advantages and disadvantages.
11. The nine battlegrounds : describes the nine common situations (or stages) in a campaign, from scattering to deadly, and the specific focus that a commander will need in order to successfully navigate them.
12. Attacking with fire : explains the general use of weapons and the specific use of the environment as a weapon. This section examines the five targets for attack, the five types of environmental attack and the appropriate responses to such attacks.
13. Intelligence and espionage : focuses on the importance of developing good information sources, and specifies the five types of intelligence sources and how to best manage each of them.",The Art of War,Sun Tzu,John Minford, ,Penguin Books,9780140455526,"1st edition,2008",112,India,English

“Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None” is a novel by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche that was originally published in four parts between 1883 and 1891.

The novel is a philosophical treatise on Nietzsche’s ideals and his idea of the “overman”. Several of the philosopher’s most famous concepts are introduced in the novel. Including the idea that God is dead (meaning that societies old foundations are dead and that the idea of good and evil has changed) and the “eternal recurrence of the same” or the idea that time is an everlasting line and that anything that can happen has already happened and will happen again eventually.


 
Nietzsche uses the protagonist of the fifth century B.C.E. Philosopher, Zarathustra in order to tell the story. Zarathustra comes down from his mountain top cave to preach to the people about the Overman but is soon rebuked. The book is mainly comprised of Zarathustra’s lessons to the people and to himself.

Globalization has been viewed as a perfect solution for the problems of many weak and nascent economies. A globally integrated economy that allowed the free flow of capital across borders was supposed to benefit the countries that opened up their markets.

That idea has not really worked out well in many places. There is an increasing number of voices protesting against globalization policies. This book, Globalization And Its Discontents analyses the reasons for this rising opposition.

The book does not explicitly take an anti globalization stand. It just inquires into the failures of the idea in certain regions of the world. It examines the factors that contributed towards this failure. The author mainly focuses on the policies of international organizations like the IMF and the World Bank. He says that the global organizations employed a one solution fits all policy. They did not take into account the unique problems and needs of each country that they tried to help. They simply worked on the belief that a free market was the cure to all economic ills.

The author takes up the cases of South Asia and Russia to illustrate his points. He says institutions like the IMF encouraged free flow of capital even in regions without a strongly regulated financial sector. This left the field open for speculative short term investors. These investors panicked and pulled out at the slightest signs of an economic crisis. This destabilized the already weak economies of many developing countries, and whole nations went bankrupt.

The loans from IMF imposed strict conditions on the borrowing countries. These included asking the countries to cut their expenditure on public spending like food subsidies. When economies collapsed and many people lost their jobs, they did not even have a social safety net to fall back on. This led to social and political unrest in countries like Indonesia and Russia. So, the institutions that were supposed to help these countries strengthen their economies instead worsened the crisis, says the author. Globalization And Its Discontents says globalization as such is not a bad idea. It brings in global funding into poor economies and opens up new opportunities and new markets.

What is needed, says the author, are reforms in the functioning of institutions like the IMF. He says that there is need for increased transparency and accountability in these organizations.

The Metamorphosis and Other Stories, by Franz Kafka, is part of the Barnes and Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes and Noble Classics:
All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes and Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.


Virtually unknown during his lifetime, Franz Kafka is now one of the world’s most widely read and discussed authors. His nightmarish novels and short stories have come to symbolize modern man’s anxiety and alienation in a bizarre, hostile, and dehumanized world. This vision is most fully realized in Kafka’s masterpiece, “The Metamorphosis,” a story that is both harrowing and amusing, and a landmark of modern literature. 

Bringing together some of Kafka’s finest work, this collection demonstrates the richness and variety of the author’s artistry. “The Judgment,” which Kafka considered to be his decisive breakthrough, and “The Stoker,” which became the first chapter of his novel Amerika, are here included. These two, along with “The Metamorphosis,” form a suite of stories Kafka referred to as “The Sons,” and they collectively present a devastating portrait of the modern family.

Also included are “In the Penal Colony,” a story of a torture machine and its operators and victims, and “A Hunger Artist,” about the absurdity of an artist trying to communicate with a misunderstanding public. Kafka’s lucid, succinct writing chronicles the labyrinthine complexities, the futility-laden horror, and the stifling oppressiveness that permeate his vision of modern life.

Justice has multiple dimensions and cannot be defined as or decided upon in singular terms. It can mean different things to different people in different instances. It is, in simple words, understood as existing and varying on a continuum. This is the central aspect of the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen’s book, The Idea Of Justice.

This remarkable book by the distinguished economist questions the very notion of social justice being a far-fetched ideal or an achievable and practical possibility. The book defines a perfectly just society and also traces the concept of social justice as understood by philosophers and thinkers over ages. People have continued to face differences in opinions regarding what is just and what is not, and the book places special emphasis on the alternative and comparative perspectives on justice.

The author has introduced an approach to justice followed by the demands of justice, materials of justice, forms of reasoning, and public reasoning and democracy. Within the four parts the book has been divided into are chapters covering endlessly thought-provoking topics.

This book, published in 2009, is dedicated to the memory of one of Amartya Sen’s teachers, named John Rawls.

The first playwright to depict suffering without reference to the gods, Euripides (484-407 BC) made his characters speak in human terms and face the consequences of their actions. In Medea, a woman rejected by her lover takes hideous revenge by murdering the children they both love, and Hecabe depicts the former queen of Troy, driven mad by the prospect of her daughter's sacrifice to Achilles. Electra portrays a young woman planning to avenge the brutal death of her father at the hands of her mother, while in Heracles the hero seeks vengeance against the evil king who has caused bloodshed in his family.

The journey in The Discovery of India begins from ancient history, leading up to the last years of the British Raj. He uses his knowledge of the Upanishads, Vedas, and textbooks on ancient history to introduce to the reader the development of India from the Indus Valley Civilization, through the changes in socio-political old scene scenario every foreign invader brought, to the present day conditions.

Nehru was jailed for his participation in the Quit India movement along with other Indian leaders, and he used this time to write down his thoughts and knowledge about India's history. The book is widely regarded as a classic in India since its first publication in 1946[citation needed], and provides a broad view of Indian history, philosophy and culture, as viewed from the eyes of a liberal Indian fighting for the independence of his country.

In The Discovery of India, Nehru argued that India was a historic nation with a right to sovereignty. This book also analyses in depth the philosophy of Indian life. (wikipedia.org)",The Discovery of India,Jawaharlal Nehru, , ,Penguin Books,9780143031031,"Reprinted,2010",642,India,English

He Algebra of Infinite Justice (2001) is a collection of essays written by Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy. The book discusses several perspectives of global and local concerns, among them one being the abuse of Nuclear bomb showoffs.

The book discusses several issues from fields as diverse as the political euphoria in India over its successful nuclear bomb tests, the 'power' politics wherein she discusses the power generating companies of the world manipulating the laws and policies of the many power-deprived nations.

Introduction:

A few weeks after India detonated a thermonuclear device in 1998, Arundhati Roy wrote ‘The End of Imagination’. The essay attracted worldwide attention as the voice of a brilliant Indian writer speaking out with clarity and conscience against nuclear weapons. Over the next three and a half years, she wrote a series of political essays on a diverse range of momentous subjects: from the illusory benefits of big dams, to the downside of corporate globalization and the US Government’s war against terror. First published in 2001, The Algebra of Infinite Justice brings together all of Arundhati Roy’s political writings so far. This revised paperback edition includes two new essays, written in early 2002: ‘Democracy: Who’s She When She’s at Home’, that examines the horrific communal violence in Gujarat, and ‘War Talk: Summer Games with Nuclear Bombs’, about the threat of nuclear war in the Subcontinent.",The Algebra of Infinite Justice (Award-Winning Authors' Books),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143419280,"Edition,2017",252,India,English

White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India is a tale with many levels, featuring Captain James Achilles Kirkpatrick as the protagonist. On one level, the book details the tragic romance between Kirkpatrick and Khair-un-Nissa, a Muslim noblewoman. On a different level, the story sheds light on the social, military, political, and trade aspects of 18th and 19th century India.

Captain Kirkpatrick is an ambitious soldier in the East India Company. When his eyes settle upon the beautiful Khair, the Nizam’s great-niece, the course of his life takes a new direction. Kirkpatrick soon learns that he must overcome many obstacles in order to marry Khair. Firstly, she is locked in purdah and engaged to be married to a nobleman. Secondly, as a Resident, Kirkpatrick is obligated to convert to Islam, which he hopes will make it easier for him to marry Khair. Kirkpatrick also ends up working as a double-agent, while working for the East India Company, he is actually supporting the Hyderabadis.

Apart from this love story, Dalrymple, also presents a side of history which is virtually unexplored by historians. Through memorable characters such as Hindoo Stuart and Sir David Ochterlony, the author draws readers’ attention to the concept of “white Mughals”. These are people of British descent who had adopted Indian customs, traditions, but who were also a source of embarrassment for colonial administrations. After conducting over five years of research, the author portrays a fascinating portrait about social etiquette, sexual and dismissive attitudes, and the growing racist treatment by the ruling British class towards the offspring of mixed race couples.
White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India won the 2003 Scottish Book Of the Year. In 2011, Dalrymple announced that British actor Ralph Fiennes would act and direct the movie-version of book.

Emraan Hashmi is not just a charming face or an unconventional actor. He is not just bold in his character portrayals. Hashmi, or Emmi as his family members call him, is also a father who is level-headed, unfazed and unyielding.

The Kiss of Life is about that time in Hashmi's life when his son needed him the most, the time when all his other experiences paled in comparison to the tennis ball tumour that invaded his son's kidney.

The chapters alternate between the present - the hospital wards, chemo and the shivers - and the past, where Hashmi battles his own doubts of being an actor, the ups and downs in his career, the media branding him as a serial kisser, the typecasting and so on.

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.) 
Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention). 
We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.
Yeah, there's going to be trouble. Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.
On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again. 
Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.) 
Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

The short, free-verse poem begins with an epigraph from one of van Gogh’s letters to his brother. “That does not keep me from having a terrible need of—shall I say the word—religion,” van Gogh wrote. “Then I go out at night to paint the stars.” Sexton used epigraphs from a variety of works to begin her poems, and the epigraphs are often of major importance, pointing to a main theme of the poem that might otherwise be overlooked. Here she is indicating that she shares not only the mental imbalance, suicidal tendencies, and artistic nature of the Dutch artist but also his unsatisfied desire for the spiritual.

When van Gogh wrote the letter to his brother, he was painting the masterpiece Starry Night on the Rhone, which is described in the poem. The painting captures the night sky in blues and blacks, with a swirl of violent orange representing the moon, and burning yellow-white stars. One would expect a peaceful scene from the title, but this painting is intensely disquieting. The movement seems to be a great rush skyward, the sleeping town beneath the sky unconscious of this spiraling of all nature toward infinity. Sexton sees this painting as a reflection of her own death wish. The dark tree at the edge of the painting is described as “black-haired”—Sexton was a brunette—and it “slips/ up like a drowned woman into the hot sky.” To make her meaning clearer, she continues, “This is how/ I want to die.”

The poem interprets the painting as presenting a nature that is animate and hostile. Nevertheless, the picture attracts the speaker, because nature’s brute force promises death, release from the burden of self. Sexton sees the central moon image in the painting as a great dragon that will suck her up into its being. She desires, she says, “to split/ from my life with no flag,/ no belly,/ no cry”—to merge silently and painlessly with the infinite. The images may suggest not a rediscovery of religion but a terrifying substitute for it. Part of the appeal of this poem lies in the vivid interpretation of the painting and in the kinship the reader sees between Sexton and van Gogh.",Starry Nights,Shobhaa De, , ,Penguin Books,9780143421313,"1st Edition,2013",315,India,English

Insiders know that besides her commitment to work and the frantic pace of her life, Shobhaa Dé's first priority in life has always been her family. Here she writes poignantly of her early years, and of her relationship with her parents and siblings, her husband and her children. Shobha De's high voltage career 'happened' in unexpected ways, starting with her unplanned entry as a teenager into the glamorous world of modeling, and moving on to her high-profile years as a magazine editor. In these avatars she keenly observed and astutely chronicled the new India— brash, affluent and ambitious. High-society hi-jinks, movie star follies, celebrity neurosis— none of these escaped her unsparing eye. And now she tells it all, just as it was, just as she saw it. In her inimitably forthright fashion, she writes of the choices she made, the decisions she took and the influences that shaped her.

One Hundred Years Of Solitude, a literary masterpiece by the Nobel Laureate, is a metaphoric mirror to Colombian history. The contemplative novel drapes the tale of the rise and fall of Macondo and magically captures the life and times of the Buendia family over seven generations.  

Summary Of The Book:
Set in a fictional town called Macondo in Northern Colombia, One Hundred Years Of Solitude begins with Jose Arcadio Buendia leaving his hometown with his wife Ursula, in search of a better life. One night during their journey, they happen to camp at a riverside where Jose dreams about a spectacular city and decides to establish one on the same riverbank. Thus, he builds Macondo and slowly shapes it into how he wants a city to be. Macondo then begins to miraculously attract unusual people and extraordinary events that make for a gripping plot. The adventurous Buendias find themselves in the middle of some of the most historically potent 
circumstances in Colombia. As the lineage stands in the face of the glory and downfall of a civilization, Marquez's lyrical magic manifests the delicate nuances of love and war, youth and senility, and passion and lust. And finally, what had started as an innocent dream of Jose, Ursula and 19 other families gradually break down and fall prey to lawless anarchy. 

One Hundred Years Of Solitude also chronicles the political and economic developments of the 19th century Colombia, such as corruption and capitalism with a touch of fiction. In a deeply touching and thought provoking non-linear narrative, Marquez paints a hundred years of history on the canvas of time. He uses his prerogative of having witnessed the wave of the Colombian revolution to graphically depict its lasting influence. He arrests in prose, the magical realism surrounding life, death, peace and the truth of mankind. 

Written originally in Spanish, One Hundred Years Of Solitude was published first in 1967. It has since been translated into 37 languages and sold more than 20 million copies worldover. A recipient of global acclaim and numerous awards, the book won Marquez his Nobel Prize in 1982.

The book starts with Greg writing about how his mother is always saying that ""friends will come and go but family is forever."" Greg doesn't believe that, since his friend, Rowley, now has a girlfriend named Abigail, continuing from the events of the last book. Ever since then, Rowley has been acting different, such as refusing to hang out with Greg and agreeing with everything Abigail says.

Greg has been getting bored without Rowley, so his mother tells him to ""branch out"" and make friends with the kids in the neighborhood. He decides to become friends with Fregley, since he could ""mold him into EXACTLY the type of friend [he] need[s]."" Greg tries to get Fregley to do funny things during lunch, and Fregley then becomes popular after the other kids find out that he can ""chew"" food with his belly button.

Greg's mother announces that her extended family will come to town for Easter. Greg then writes about some of his family members, including Meemaw, who organized egg hunts in the backyard. On Easter, the family notices through a photo album that Meemaw has hidden her diamond ring in an egg, and everyone rushes out to find it, although the search is unsuccessful.

Greg decides to join an after-school activity, and with the help of a Magic 8-Ball he found on Easter, he becomes a member of the Yearbook Club. The next day, Greg accidentally drops his Magic 8-Ball, and it breaks. Greg is called to the yearbook office to take yearbook photos of Fregley (Most Popular) and Rowley and Abigail (Cutest Couple). He then resigns from his position.

Greg throws his broken Magic 8-Ball into his grandmother's yard. At school, he learns that Rowley and Abigail have broken up. Greg wonders if he and Rowley should be friends again. He goes back to the Magic 8-Ball, hoping to get ""one last good answer,"" and finds the plastic egg with Meemaw's ring. To avoid breaking up his family, he hides the egg in his mother's closet.

Greg concludes that he has to make big decisions on his own, and reconciles with Rowley. He writes, ""I know Mom's always saying that friends come and go and family is forever, and maybe that's true. [...] I'm sure me and Rowley will get in another fight somewhere down the road and then we'll go through this drama all over again. But for now, we're good.""",Diary of a Wimpy Kid : Hard Luck,Jeff Kinney, , ,Penguin Books,9780141353074,"Edition,2016",236,India,English

The God of Small Things is the debut novel of Indian writer Arundhati Roy. It is a story about the childhood experiences of fraternal twins whose lives are destroyed by the ""Love Laws"" that lay down ""who should be loved, and how. And how much."" The book explores how the small things affect people's behavior and their lives. It won the Booker Prize in 1997.

ndian history and politics shape the plot and meaning of The God of Small Things in a variety of ways. Some of Roy's commentary is on the surface, with jokes and snippets of wisdom about political realities in India. However, the novel also examines the historical roots of these realities and develops profound insights into the ways in which human desperation and desire emerge from the confines of a firmly entrenched caste society.

The story is set in the caste society of India, at a time when members of the Untouchable Paravan or Paryan caste were not permitted to touch members of higher castes or enter their houses. The Untouchables were considered polluted beings. They had the lowliest jobs and lived in subhuman conditions. In India, the caste system was considered a way to organize society. Roy's book shows how terribly cruel such a system can be.

Along with the caste system, readers see an economic class struggle. The Ipes are considered upper class. They are factory owners, the dominating class. Mammachi and Baby Kochamma would not deign to mix with those of a lower class.

However, Roy shows other types of less evident discrimination. For example, there is religious discrimination. It is unacceptable for a Syrian Christian to marry a Hindu and vice versa, and Hindus can only marry a Hindu from the same caste. In more than one passage of the book, the reader feels Rahel's and Estha's discomfort at being half Hindu. Baby Kochamma constantly makes disparaging comments about Hindus. On the other hand, there is discomfort even between Christian denominations as is shown by Pappachi's negative reaction when Baby Kochamma converts to Catholicism.

Chacko suffers more veiled racial discrimination, as it seems his daughter also does. His English wife's parents were shocked and disapproving that their daughter would marry an Indian, no matter how well educated. Sophie, at one point, mentions to her cousins that they are all ""wog,"" while she is ""half-wog.""

The Ipes are very class-conscious and feel a need to maintain their status. Discrimination is a way of protecting their privileged position in society.",The God of Small Things (Man Booker Prize 1997),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143028574,"1st Published,2002",340,India,English

The Partition in history is a record of a point in time when the country was split apart along religious lines. It is an abstract piece of history for most people. While many books have documented the Partition and the violence surrounding it, most have focused on the social and political causes, and analyzed it as a collection of abstract data. Train To Pakistan is one of the books that focuses on the human drama, the real suffering of the people caught in the middle.
Mano Majra is a village that suddenly becomes part of a border between two countries. The population of the village is predominantly Sikh and Muslim. When news of communal riots and killings reach the village, the different communities express their support for each other and swear to defend one another. However, external influences are just waiting around the corner to disturb this idyllic harmony.
A train filled with the massacred bodies of Hindus and Sikhs arrives at Mano Majra. Slowly, passions gets stoked up, especially by the influx of refugees from the newly created Pakistan. They have tales of horror to tell, and the passions of Sikhs and Hindus of the village are stirred up.
Vested interests, including that of the village magistrate’s, stir up the flames. Hindus and Sikhs who just recently swore to stand by their Muslim neighbors now turn against them. Caught in all this are Juggut Singh and Iqbal. Juggut is a criminal, while Iqbal is a western educated intellectual who is on a mission to reform society. The common thread that binds them together is that they are both thrown into jail as suspects in a murder.
Ram Lal, a local moneylender, has been murdered. Ram Lal was a Hindu and this is used by subversive elements to incite violence against Muslims. The police, in a desperate attempt to divert attention, arrest Iqbal and Juggut.

Glimpses Of World History was written by Nehru in 1934, which provides the readers a panoramic sweep of history, comprising 196 letters in total. These letters were written from a number of prisons in British India from 1930 to 1933. The sole objective of these letters was to introduce Nehru’s daughter, Indira, to world history. In his first letter, Nehru tells Indira about his sadness at being unable to send her any material gift from prison. He goes on to tell her that he would give her something he could afford, which was a series of letters, straight from his heart.

Since these letters were written during his time in prison, Nehru didn’t have access to any reference books, but only his personal notes. Through the course of this book, he covers the history of mankind from 6000 BC till the time he wrote this book. He tells the readers about the rise and fall of large civilizations and empires from Rome, Greece, West Asia, and China. He also throws light on several renowned historical figures such as Genghis Khan, Vladimir Lenin, Mohandas K. Gandhi, and Ashoka. One of his chapters talks about Genghis Khan and the Mongol invasion in a way that is against major European views of that time. He mentions that Genghis was, without doubt, history’s greatest military genius and leader, considering Alexander and Caesar petty before Genghis.

He wrote about several cultures in detail, as he wasn’t in favor of the current way history was taught at school. Owing to the fact that history teaching at school revolved only around a particular country, he wrote about world history to his daughter, to help her understand why people did what they did. These letters have been written in an informal manner, packed with contemporary as well as personal experiences.

In The Outsider (1942), his classic existentialist novel, Camus explores the alienation of an individual who refuses to conform to social norms. Meursault, his anti-hero, will not lie. When his mother dies, he refuses to show his emotions simply to satisfy the expectations of others. And when he commits a random act of violence on a sun-drenched beach near Algiers, his lack of remorse compounds his guilt in the eyes of society and the law. Yet he is as much a victim as a criminal.

Albert Camus' portrayal of a man confronting the absurd, and revolting against the injustice of society, depicts the paradox of man's joy in life when faced with the 'tender indifference' of the world.

Sandra Smith's translation, based on close listening to a recording of Camus reading his work aloud on French radio in 1954, sensitively renders the subtleties and dream-like atmosphere of L'?tranger.

Albert Camus (1913-1960), French novelist, essayist and playwright, is one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. His most famous works include The Myth of Sisyphus (1942), The Plague (1947), The Just (1949), The Rebel (1951) and The Fall (1956). He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, and his last novel, The First Man, unfinished at the time of his death, appeared in print for the first time in 1994, and was published in English soon after by Hamish Hamilton.

Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is a 2012 non-fiction book written by Susan Cain. Cain argues that modern Western culture misunderstands and undervalues the traits and capabilities of introverted people, leading to ""a colossal waste of talent, energy, and happiness"".

The book presents a history of how Western culture transformed from a culture of character to a culture of personality in which an ""extrovert ideal"" dominates and introversion is viewed as inferior or even pathological. Adopting scientific definitions of introversion and extroversion as preferences for different levels of stimulation, Quiet outlines the advantages and disadvantages of each temperament, emphasizing the myth of the extrovert ideal that has dominated in the West since the early twentieth century. Asserting that temperament is a core element of human identity, Cain cites research in biology, psychology, neuroscience and evolution to demonstrate that introversion is both common and normal, noting that many of humankind's most creative individuals and distinguished leaders were introverts. Cain urges changes at the workplace, in schools, and in parenting; offers advice to introverts for functioning in an extrovert-dominated culture; and offers advice in communication, work, and relationships between people of differing temperament.",Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can not Stop Talking,Susan Cain, , ,Penguin Books,9780307352156,"1st Edition,2013",348,Abroad,English

Love in the Time of Cholera is a celebration of life over death, love over despair, and health over sickness. It is the story of Florentino Ariza, who was rejected by Fermina Daza in his youth. He maintains a silent vigil of unrequited love for fifty-one years, nine months, and four days, until he meets Fermina again at her husband’s wake and renews his suit. The novel spans a period from the late 1870’s to the early 1930’s, and it is set in a South American community modeled after Cartagena, Colombia, and besieged by civil wars and plagues.

Florentino, an eighteen-year-old apprentice telegraph operator, sees thirteen-year old Fermina and falls madly in love. Fermina’s father finds out and sends his daughter on an extended trip to remove her from temptation. She returns years later, rejects Florentino, and accepts the proposal of a cultured physician and cholera specialist, Dr. Juvenal Urbino. Although Florentino continues to love Fermina throughout the years, he also continues his own social relationships—engaging in 622 long-term liaisons, which he records in a series of notebooks—and becomes president of a riverboat company. Then Florentino learns that eighty-one-year-old Juvenal has died, falling off a ladder trying to capture a condescending, bilingual parrot.

Darwin's theory of natural selection issued a profound challenge to orthodox thought and belief: no being or species has been specifically created; all are locked into a pitiless struggle for existence, with extinction looming for those not fitted for the task. 

Yet The Origin of Species (1859) is also a humane and inspirational vision of ecological interrelatedness, revealing the complex mutual interdependencies between animal and plant life, climate and physical environment, and - by implication - within the human world. 

Written for the general reader, in a style which combines the rigour of science with the subtlety of literature, The Origin of Species remains one of the founding documents of the modern age.",On the Origin of Species,Charles Darwin, , ,Penguin Books,9780451529060, , ,Abroad,English

Land of Two Rivers: A History of Bengal provides an incisive look into the history of Bengal, one of the most fascinating and influential regions in the Indian subcontinent. Located at the confluence of two major rivers, Ganga and Brahmaputra, Bengal has been the center of trade, learning and the arts for the longest time. In the medieval era, the rise of Muslim dynasties in Bengal brought into being a unique culture which was very different from that of northern India. The British colonization in the 18th century further transformed the social and economic structure of the region. In this book, the author traces the formation of Bengali identity through the Bengal Renaissance, the growth of nationalist politics and partition of Bengal in 1947. This book will make for an engaging and informative read for those interested in the history of Bengal.

The story unfolds on a cold April day in 1984 in Oceania, the totalitarian superpower in post World War II Europe. Winston Smith, employed as a records (no, not vinyl) editor at the Ministry of Truth, drags himself home to Victory Mansions (nothing victorious about them) for lunch. Depressed and oppressed, he starts a journal of his rebellious thoughts against the Party. If discovered, this journal will result in his execution. Now that’s playing with fire. For the sake of added precautions, Winston only writes when safe from the view of the surveying telescreens. And when that shot of industrial grade ""Victory Gin"" kicks in.

At work, Winston becomes curious about ""the brunette"" (a.k.a. Julia), a machine-operator in the Fiction Department. Although at one time he feared that she was a member of the Thought Police, all such paranoia ends when she slips him a note reading ""I love you"" in the corridor one day. The two begin a secret love affair, first meeting up in the countryside, and then in a rented room atop Mr. Charrington’s shop in the prole district. All of these places are away from surveillance – or so they think.

As Winston and Julia fall deeper in love, Winston’s views about their government (the Party) change. There’s something about Ingsoc that doesn’t seem quite right – is it the manipulation? The changing of history? The all-around sketchiness? Winston is drawn to the revolutionary ""Brotherhood"" because, well, they’re revolutionary. Eventually, Winston makes contact with O’Brien, who Winston thinks is a member of the Brotherhood, but who in actuality is a member of the Thought Police. O’Brien arranges for Winston to receive a copy of ""the book,"" a resistance manifesto which supposedly exposes the how and the why for the resistance.

Unfortunately, Winston never finds out the why. Instead, he gets tortured. But before the torturing, he and Julia are apprehended by the Thought Police. Turns out that secret hiding place wasn’t so secret after all. The happy couple is then brought to the Ministry of Love, where criminals and opponents of the Party are tortured, interrogated, and ""reintegrated"" before their release and ultimate execution. O’Brien runs the show as far as Winston’s torture sessions are concerned.

Months later, Winston is sent to Room 101, where a person is faced with his greatest fear. Rats…why did it have to be rats? Musing on the impending rats-chewing-on-his-face scenario, Winston calls out, ""Do it to Julia!"" That’s pretty much what O’Brien was looking for, so Winston gets to go back to being a happy member of the rat race. Released, Winston’s heart is filled with love for the Party. Even when he and Julia meet again by chance, they feel apathetic towards each other. The last man in Europe has been converted and destroyed. Quite the fine point there, George.

There, traditional stereotypes such as “Men have bigger brains” and women are ""naturally weak"" are countered with logic such as ""an elephant also has a bigger and heavier brain"" and “a lion is stronger than a man” and yet neither of them dominates men.[3] In Ladyland crime is eliminated, since men were considered responsible for all of it.

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.)

Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention).

We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.

Yeah, there's going to be trouble.

Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.

On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again.

Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.)

Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

Marquez's novel is very repetitive and nonlinear, so we're going to lay it down for you in a straightforward and chronological order. It's not what Marquez intended, but it sure is easier to understand.

Six months before 'the incident,' Bayardo San Román comes barging into town looking like he's the best thing since sliced bread. No one knows who he is, and the only thing they do know is that he's looking for a wife. Apparently no one in town thinks this is sketchy, so we'll roll with it too.

One day he randomly chooses Angela as his bride-to-be, despite the fact that she has no interest in him at all. His unrequited love is totally in line with his sketchy character, but everyone seems to ignore the sketch-factor because the dude's richer than Bill Gates. Anyway, Angela's lack of love for Bayardo is not the only problem. She has a secret: She's not a virgin.

Angela's impoverished family doesn't care about this fact and they basically force her into marrying Bayardo. After four months, they have the biggest wedding the town has ever seen. Everyone who's anyone (and some people who aren't even anyone) comes to the party. But it all comes crashing down on their wedding night when it's revealed that Angela is not a virgin.

Bayardo takes her back home, where Angela's mom beats her for about two hours. She tells her brothers that Santiago is the guy who deflowered her, and that's when the murder plot begins.

The next day, the town is still in a festive mood because the Bishop is supposed to visit. They even have crazy amounts of roosters prepared for his favorite cock-comb soup. So even though it's Monday, everything is not operating the way it would normally, which is unfortunate for poor Santiago.

In the hours that follow, everything that could go wrong does go wrong. It's like the darkest black comedy you've ever seen. By 6 AM everyone in town knows that the brothers are going to kill Santiago, but no one does anything. Even though the brothers don't want to kill him, no one stops them. What the heck is up with this town?

In the end, Santiago is killed at his own doorstep.

After the murder, the whole town can't stop talking about it. Angela's family leaves town and so does her husband of five hours. There's even a trial, but it doesn't seem that anything comes of it aside from some pretty cool records written in red ink.

Years later, our narrator goes around talking to the residents of the town. He tries to get some kind of truth, but we don't get anything concrete except for one sad truth: Santiago is dead.

Our lives and specifically the market are so full of random aspects and complex structures. Understanding the behaviour of markets and attributing specific reasons to its behaviour is totally impossible and sometimes a useless task. As the title explains, Taleb’s theory explains how all of us get fooled easily by randomness. Taleb goes on to elaborate how we misconstrue luck and skill. Wherever true luck plays a role, we assume it to be the work of individual skill. Most impressive situations in life are only due to luck, claims Taleb. He uses the theory of black swans (rare events) to propound his idea and says that black swans cannot be predicted.

Taleb elucidates his theory through some popular examples using people like the baseball expert Yogi Berra, the philosopher Karl Popper, the ancient wise man Solon, the financier George Soros and the Greek voyager Odysseus. Most of all, journalists and traders fall for the randomness as well. In addition to real-life examples, Taleb also brings in the case of the fictitious hero Nero, who is smart enough to understand the play of randomness in his professional life, but is superstitiously foolish.

Taleb also constructs an invincible, nameless fool who seems to be at the right place at the right time. The fool has a steady string of followers who are ready to do anything for their Guru. But, the fool’s actions cannot be imitated. His success is one obtained by chance.

The most unexpected things will happen for sure. But, we become creatures of routine that we fail to identify it when it happens. Moreover, detecting risks and accepting them is done only by the emotional part of the brain. If we understand probability, then we can perceive the role of luck in everyday situations. The trick lies in recognizing it. Taleb says we must be aware of the trap that luck sets for us.

How do we distinguish a lucky poseur from a far-sighted visionary? How do we read an incident? How do we decide whether it is luck or talent that made the person successful?

Fooled By Randomness: The Hidden Role Of Chance In The Markets And In Life received wide recognition. Fortune named it as one of the smartest books of all time and the Financial Times termed it as the Book of the Year.

Is life worth living? If life does not possess any significance when confronted with the reality of human existence, is suicide our only alternative? In the essay, Camus introduces the readers to his philosophy of the absurd where man’s futile search for meaning, unity and clarity is questioned. The author states that to realize the reason for our existence, we need to break the norms of normalcy and revolt. During the course of the book, Camus outlines numerous approaches to the absurd life. The author compares the absurdity of human life with the situation of Sisyphus, a Greek mythological figure who was condemned to forever repeat a meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain only to see it roll down again.

In a very engaging and interesting manner, the author states that humans should embrace the absurd. By embracing the absurd, it means that we accept all the unreasonable things that the world has to offer. Camus arrives at three consequences from the full acknowledgement of the absurd, revolt, freedom and passion. How then should the absurd man live? What is the purpose of life? Is suicide the answer to all the problems in life? Through a philosophical series of questioning, this book truly depicts life in a unique and refreshing manner. The book is for all those people who are interested in the philosophy of existentialism, this book will truly engage the readers till the last page.

Camus has drawn some very powerful consequences about life and mortality. Knowing the fact that one day all of us are going to die is a great liberator. Therefore traditions accepted as morals, ethics accepted as habits, all cease to be less important when we know that our time on the planet is limited. An oversimplified version of the essay is that man is only a small part of a vast and endless universe and that the most a man can do is to live their life to the fullest at every moment.

This book serves as a follow-up book to the author’s bestselling 1999 book, The Power Of Now, which promoted the idea that in order to achieve lasting happiness, human beings must learn to dissociate their thoughts from their identities. A New Earth: Create A Better Life builds extensively upon the same primary theme, exploring a different perspective this time around.

The first book had an introspective quality and focused on the spiritual needs of the individual. On the other hand, this book turns the spotlight outwards, choosing to highlight the ways in which an individual’s spiritual evolution can be instrumental in shaping humanity’s collective spiritual consciousness.

Divided into ten chapters, the book begins with a chapter on the awakening of human consciousness. The next three chapters focus on the concept of ego, exploring how attachment towards one’s thoughts, memories, and possessions can give rise to an illusory and harmful sense of self.

In the subsequent chapters, the author discusses concepts such as recurring emotional pain, the space of consciousness, and inner and outer purpose. The final chapter presents the three elements that the author considers to be collectively representative of an awakened consciousness.

A New Earth: Create A Better Life was first published in 2005 by Penguin. It went on to receive high worldwide acclaim, its popularity scaling further when it was chosen as a recommended title by Oprah Winfrey’s Book Club in 2008. This edition is a 2009 reprint by Penguin Books.

About Eckhart Tolle

Eckhart Tolle is a German-Canadian author and public speaker.

He has written books such as Guardians Of Being, A New Earth: Awakening To Your Life’s Purpose, The Power Of Now: A Guide To Spiritual Enlightenment, Oneness With All Life: Inspirational Selections from A New Earth, and Stillness Speaks: Whispers of Now.

Distinctly permeated by a highly spiritual quality, Tolle’s writing explores psychology, metaphysics, and other realms of the esoteric.

Tolle was born as Ulrich Leonard Tolle in 1948 in Germany. He had a very turbulent and disturbed childhood. With the consent of his father, he chose to study language, literature, and astronomy at home instead of attending high school. After a brief teaching stint in London, he went on to study literature, psychology, and philosophy at the University of London. After graduation, Tolle joined Cambridge University on a research scholarship. A profound inner transformation at the age of 29 saw him eventually turning into a spiritual teacher and counselor. He spreads his teachings through his company, video website, speeches, and workshops, choosing to steer clear of undue focus on commercial motivation.

The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Late Spring and Autumn Period (roughly 5th century BC). The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (""Master Sun"", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to an aspect of warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare[1] and has influenced both Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy and beyond.

This book contained a detailed explanation and analysis of the Chinese military, from weapons and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun Tzu also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Because Sun Tzu has long been considered to be one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training for centuries to come.
Chapter summary
1. Detail assessment and planning: explores the five fundamental factors (the Way, seasons, terrain, leadership, and management) and seven elements that determine the outcomes of military engagements. By thinking, assessing and comparing these points, a commander can calculate his chances of victory. Habitual deviation from these calculations will ensure failure via improper action. The text stresses that war is a very grave matter for the state and must not be commenced without due consideration.
2. Waging war : explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how success requires winning decisive engagements quickly. This section advises that successful military campaigns require limiting the cost of competition and conflict.
3. Strategic attack : defines the source of strength as unity, not size, and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war. In order of importance, these critical factors are: Attack, Strategy, Alliances, Army and Cities.
4. Disposition of the army : explains the importance of defending existing positions until a commander is capable of advancing from those positions in safety. It teaches commanders the importance of recognizing strategic opportunities, and teaches not to create opportunities for the enemy.
5. Forces : explains the use of creativity and timing in building an army's momentum.
6. Weaknesses and strengths : explains how an army's opportunities come from the openings in the environment caused by the relative weakness of the enemy and how to respond to changes in the fluid battlefield over a given area.
7. Military maneuvers : explains the dangers of direct conflict and how to win those confrontations when they are forced upon the commander.
8. Variations and adaptability : focuses on the need for flexibility in an army's responses. It explains how to respond to shifting circumstances successfully.
9. Movement and development of troops : describes the different situations in which an army finds itself as it moves through new enemy territories, and how to respond to these situations. Much of this section focuses on evaluating the intentions of others.
10. Terrain : looks at the three general areas of resistance (distance, dangers and barriers) and the six types of ground positions that arise from them. Each of these six field positions offers certain advantages and disadvantages.
11. The nine battlegrounds : describes the nine common situations (or stages) in a campaign, from scattering to deadly, and the specific focus that a commander will need in order to successfully navigate them.
12. Attacking with fire : explains the general use of weapons and the specific use of the environment as a weapon. This section examines the five targets for attack, the five types of environmental attack and the appropriate responses to such attacks.
13. Intelligence and espionage : focuses on the importance of developing good information sources, and specifies the five types of intelligence sources and how to best manage each of them.",The Art of War,Sun Tzu,John Minford, ,Penguin Books,9780140455526,"1st edition,2008",112,India,English

“Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None” is a novel by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche that was originally published in four parts between 1883 and 1891.

The novel is a philosophical treatise on Nietzsche’s ideals and his idea of the “overman”. Several of the philosopher’s most famous concepts are introduced in the novel. Including the idea that God is dead (meaning that societies old foundations are dead and that the idea of good and evil has changed) and the “eternal recurrence of the same” or the idea that time is an everlasting line and that anything that can happen has already happened and will happen again eventually.


 
Nietzsche uses the protagonist of the fifth century B.C.E. Philosopher, Zarathustra in order to tell the story. Zarathustra comes down from his mountain top cave to preach to the people about the Overman but is soon rebuked. The book is mainly comprised of Zarathustra’s lessons to the people and to himself.

Globalization has been viewed as a perfect solution for the problems of many weak and nascent economies. A globally integrated economy that allowed the free flow of capital across borders was supposed to benefit the countries that opened up their markets.

That idea has not really worked out well in many places. There is an increasing number of voices protesting against globalization policies. This book, Globalization And Its Discontents analyses the reasons for this rising opposition.

The book does not explicitly take an anti globalization stand. It just inquires into the failures of the idea in certain regions of the world. It examines the factors that contributed towards this failure. The author mainly focuses on the policies of international organizations like the IMF and the World Bank. He says that the global organizations employed a one solution fits all policy. They did not take into account the unique problems and needs of each country that they tried to help. They simply worked on the belief that a free market was the cure to all economic ills.

The author takes up the cases of South Asia and Russia to illustrate his points. He says institutions like the IMF encouraged free flow of capital even in regions without a strongly regulated financial sector. This left the field open for speculative short term investors. These investors panicked and pulled out at the slightest signs of an economic crisis. This destabilized the already weak economies of many developing countries, and whole nations went bankrupt.

The loans from IMF imposed strict conditions on the borrowing countries. These included asking the countries to cut their expenditure on public spending like food subsidies. When economies collapsed and many people lost their jobs, they did not even have a social safety net to fall back on. This led to social and political unrest in countries like Indonesia and Russia. So, the institutions that were supposed to help these countries strengthen their economies instead worsened the crisis, says the author. Globalization And Its Discontents says globalization as such is not a bad idea. It brings in global funding into poor economies and opens up new opportunities and new markets.

What is needed, says the author, are reforms in the functioning of institutions like the IMF. He says that there is need for increased transparency and accountability in these organizations.

The Metamorphosis and Other Stories, by Franz Kafka, is part of the Barnes and Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes and Noble Classics:
All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes and Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.


Virtually unknown during his lifetime, Franz Kafka is now one of the world’s most widely read and discussed authors. His nightmarish novels and short stories have come to symbolize modern man’s anxiety and alienation in a bizarre, hostile, and dehumanized world. This vision is most fully realized in Kafka’s masterpiece, “The Metamorphosis,” a story that is both harrowing and amusing, and a landmark of modern literature. 

Bringing together some of Kafka’s finest work, this collection demonstrates the richness and variety of the author’s artistry. “The Judgment,” which Kafka considered to be his decisive breakthrough, and “The Stoker,” which became the first chapter of his novel Amerika, are here included. These two, along with “The Metamorphosis,” form a suite of stories Kafka referred to as “The Sons,” and they collectively present a devastating portrait of the modern family.

Also included are “In the Penal Colony,” a story of a torture machine and its operators and victims, and “A Hunger Artist,” about the absurdity of an artist trying to communicate with a misunderstanding public. Kafka’s lucid, succinct writing chronicles the labyrinthine complexities, the futility-laden horror, and the stifling oppressiveness that permeate his vision of modern life.

Justice has multiple dimensions and cannot be defined as or decided upon in singular terms. It can mean different things to different people in different instances. It is, in simple words, understood as existing and varying on a continuum. This is the central aspect of the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen’s book, The Idea Of Justice.

This remarkable book by the distinguished economist questions the very notion of social justice being a far-fetched ideal or an achievable and practical possibility. The book defines a perfectly just society and also traces the concept of social justice as understood by philosophers and thinkers over ages. People have continued to face differences in opinions regarding what is just and what is not, and the book places special emphasis on the alternative and comparative perspectives on justice.

The author has introduced an approach to justice followed by the demands of justice, materials of justice, forms of reasoning, and public reasoning and democracy. Within the four parts the book has been divided into are chapters covering endlessly thought-provoking topics.

This book, published in 2009, is dedicated to the memory of one of Amartya Sen’s teachers, named John Rawls. Rawls wrote a book titled A Theory Of Justice, from which Sen has picked up arguments and provided a detailed evaluation of these compelling arguments. Sen has discussed the positions of justice and the situation of original position as highlighted by Rawls in his book.

This is a monumental work is a must-read for all who wish to stir their thoughts and re-think, especially in present times when the world is quivering with questions related to global justice and fairness. A masterful text, this book provides an insight into what can make societies more just rather than making it seem like an endeavour towards a mere utopian dream.",The Idea of Justice,Amartya Sen, , ,Penguin Books,9780141037851,"1st Published,2010",468,India,English

Electra portrays a young woman planning to avenge the brutal death of her father at the hands of her mother, while in Heracles the hero seeks vengeance against the evil king who has caused bloodshed in his family.

He Algebra of Infinite Justice (2001) is a collection of essays written by Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy. The book discusses several perspectives of global and local concerns, among them one being the abuse of Nuclear bomb showoffs.

The book discusses several issues from fields as diverse as the political euphoria in India over its successful nuclear bomb tests, the 'power' politics wherein she discusses the power generating companies of the world manipulating the laws and policies of the many power-deprived nations.

Introduction:

A few weeks after India detonated a thermonuclear device in 1998, Arundhati Roy wrote ‘The End of Imagination’. The essay attracted worldwide attention as the voice of a brilliant Indian writer speaking out with clarity and conscience against nuclear weapons. Over the next three and a half years, she wrote a series of political essays on a diverse range of momentous subjects: from the illusory benefits of big dams, to the downside of corporate globalization and the US Government’s war against terror. First published in 2001, The Algebra of Infinite Justice brings together all of Arundhati Roy’s political writings so far. This revised paperback edition includes two new essays, written in early 2002: ‘Democracy: Who’s She When She’s at Home’, that examines the horrific communal violence in Gujarat, and ‘War Talk: Summer Games with Nuclear Bombs’, about the threat of nuclear war in the Subcontinent.",The Algebra of Infinite Justice (Award-Winning Authors' Books),Arundhati Roy, , ,Penguin Books,9780143419280,"Edition,2017",252,India,English

An Autobiography also known as Towards The Freedom, (1936) is an autobiographical book written by the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru while he was in prison. It ran nine editions in the first year alone. He wrote the book to explore how and why he had ended up taking the path of civil disobedience that in turn led to his imprisonment.

Nehru starts his history with how his ancestors had to flee Kashmir, and then goes on to tell about his own life, with a particular emphasis on the parts of his life that had brought him to this point in time.

His entire life history, from even before his father was born, seems to have led him naturally to where he was.

White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India is a tale with many levels, featuring Captain James Achilles Kirkpatrick as the protagonist. On one level, the book details the tragic romance between Kirkpatrick and Khair-un-Nissa, a Muslim noblewoman. On a different level, the story sheds light on the social, military, political, and trade aspects of 18th and 19th century India.

Captain Kirkpatrick is an ambitious soldier in the East India Company. When his eyes settle upon the beautiful Khair, the Nizam’s great-niece, the course of his life takes a new direction. Kirkpatrick soon learns that he must overcome many obstacles in order to marry Khair. Firstly, she is locked in purdah and engaged to be married to a nobleman. Secondly, as a Resident, Kirkpatrick is obligated to convert to Islam, which he hopes will make it easier for him to marry Khair. Kirkpatrick also ends up working as a double-agent, while working for the East India Company, he is actually supporting the Hyderabadis.

Apart from this love story, Dalrymple, also presents a side of history which is virtually unexplored by historians. Through memorable characters such as Hindoo Stuart and Sir David Ochterlony, the author draws readers’ attention to the concept of “white Mughals”. These are people of British descent who had adopted Indian customs, traditions, but who were also a source of embarrassment for colonial administrations. After conducting over five years of research, the author portrays a fascinating portrait about social etiquette, sexual and dismissive attitudes, and the growing racist treatment by the ruling British class towards the offspring of mixed race couples.
White Mughals: Love And Betrayal In Eighteenth-Century India won the 2003 Scottish Book Of the Year. In 2011, Dalrymple announced that British actor Ralph Fiennes would act and direct the movie-version of book.

Emraan Hashmi is not just a charming face or an unconventional actor. He is not just bold in his character portrayals. Hashmi, or Emmi as his family members call him, is also a father who is level-headed, unfazed and unyielding.

The Kiss of Life is about that time in Hashmi's life when his son needed him the most, the time when all his other experiences paled in comparison to the tennis ball tumour that invaded his son's kidney.

The chapters alternate between the present - the hospital wards, chemo and the shivers - and the past, where Hashmi battles his own doubts of being an actor, the ups and downs in his career, the media branding him as a serial kisser, the typecasting and so on.

Hashmi's book also has extensive research material on cancer. He talks about guidelines, a nutrition plan, hospital procedures and the will power to fight the C monster.",The Kiss of Life (How a Superhero and My Son Defeated Cancer),"Emraan Hashmi,Bilal Siddiqi", , ,Penguin Books,9780143426509,"1st Edition,2016",185,India,English

Lennie and George are best friends on a road trip, but this isn't that fun kind of road trip with wacky adventures. They're broke and looking for work on the farms of Northern California. The broke part is a problem, since they're planning on owning a farm someday. George is the brains behind this operation, while Lennie is, well, a few crayons short of a 164-colors box. The duo can't hold down jobs for long, thanks to Lennie's childlike mentality and odd fetish for petting things, which includes mice, rabbits, puppies, and women. (This last one, of course, being the biggest issue—and it actually got them kicked out of their last job.) 
Good fortune smiles upon them briefly when they get work at a ranch near Soledad, California. Their co-workers include Candy (an old, one-handed fellow who owns a smelly dog), Crooks (a lonely stable hand who, BTW, is black), and Curley (an unfaithful man with severe anger management problems). We learn that Curley also has a new wife, who no one is allowed to look at (not her rule—she loves male attention). 
We also meet Slim, our local and wise ranch demi-god; and Carlson, a callous ranch hand, who tells Candy to adopt a new puppy and shoot his old dog because it's smelly. But, since Candy can't bring himself to shoot the old dog, Carlson does it for him. Nice, Carlson. And that's not the only act of violence: Curley is itching for a fight after he (falsely) suspects Slim of making time with his girl, so he gets into a brawl with Lennie—who crushes his hand.
Yeah, there's going to be trouble. Woohoo, Saturday night! Which means, time for drunken visits to the whorehouse for most of the farmhands. Slim, Lennie, Crooks, and Candy are hanging back at the ranch talking about their farm-owning dreams when Curley's wife shows up to tease them all for being weak, as they were left behind while the others went whoring (obviously a manly activity, much like shooting your dog). When Crooks tries to get her to leave his room, she explodes, reminding him that he's a ""nigger"" and that she could have him ""strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."" That's exactly the buzzkill it sounds like, and the party breaks up.
On Sunday afternoon, Lennie's in the barn with a dead puppy. He admonishes the puppy for ""going and getting killed,"" which we think is actually not so much the puppy's fault as it is Lennie's. Just then, Curley's wife walks into the barn and offers up her hair as a petting object. She worries about him messing it up though, and as she wriggles to avoid a ruined hairdo, Lennie panics and, again accidentally, breaks her neck and kills her. He runs off in a panic. Again. 
Candy discovers Curley's wife's body and runs out to George, who identifies it is as classic Lennie handiwork. When Curley finds out, he's ready to exact some vigilante-style justice—but Slim and George want a nobler death for their friend, who's currently hiding out in his safe spot and hallucinating about bunnies. (Really.) 
Finally, George shows up. He's acting all weird, so we're pretty sure something bad is about to happen. And it does. George starts talking about their dream farm and tells Lennie to look out over the river and imagine it—and then shoots him in the head. When the vigilantes show up, George tells a story about how Lennie got shot in a struggle as George tried to take the gun away. Slim get it, but everyone else is confused about why George is upset.

But this is not the only ideal of Gandhi’s that he defies: facing a midlife crisis, he falls passionately in love with a tantric god-woman (who keeps a tiger as her pet and has a dubious past). She introduces him to the pleasures of unbridled sexuality but also becomes the reason for his downfall.
