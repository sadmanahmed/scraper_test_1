When I studied different aspects of governance at the University of Dhaka, I came to know that many research works have been done focusing on good governance; however, there are limited numbers of good books in our country. Then I started studying and thinking about governing process or procedure of running different organizations of the country and particularly corporate governance in national and international perspectives. I found that there are adequate rules, regulations, acts, laws and issues regarding corporate governance in our country. But the people of our country are not very aware and do not think about the nature of corporate governance in Bangladesh. If people of any country are not aware of the rules, provision and laws related to corporate governance, establishing sustainable corporate governance will be like an illusion, not a reality in that country. 
In order to establish effective good corporate governance in our country, I started collecting literature on governing policies of different organizations. I tried to include these policies and information in a book. It is a composite form of the book titled ""A Hand Book of Corporate Governance in Bangladesh.” The book is not written basing on primary research and analysis. It is a combined form of current policies, rules and laws concerning governance in some of our important institutions. I believe that students, policy makers, researcher, financial analyst and bankers will be benefited through reading this book. They will have good ideas about the laws of our country and can make a significant contribution to the establishment of good corporate governance in Bangladesh.",A Hand Book of Corporate Governance In Bangladesh,Shakil Kalam, , ,Foundation For Research on Social Development (FRSD),9789849414711,"1st Published,2019",328,Bangladesh,English
