A womans life is transformed after having a baby. From breastfeeding to running around after the little one as he learns to walk, life can be full of joy and wonder. But things are not always that easy. Young mothers find no time to care for themselves and often fall prey to unhealthy eating habits, lack of sleep can lead to depression, romance with the husband takes a backseat while it becomes impossible to balance home with a demanding full-time career. Mum - Me is a chronicling of this very journey that every new mother goes through. Written by a young mother of two, the book provides valuable insight into raising babies and toddlers while at the same time retaining and nurturing the woman within the mother. Cherishing the woman within is as important as cherishing the child and vital in keeping alive the identity of the mother. With handy hints and advice brought alive through anecdotes and humorous life stories, this is the book for you if you are a mother or planning to become one.

But we rarely think about the strain we subject them to, rushing to the dentist only when our teeth cry out in pain. Or, sometimes, when they disturb the symmetry of our face.

Teeth may get lost while shooting for a Bollywood fighting scene. They may shrink to half their size because of too much cola intake. A man may commit suicide because of the buzzing in his ears caused by a strained muscle in the jaw. Dr. Sandesh Mayekar has seen all this and worse. He has filled the dark cavity in a molar, fought smelly mouth odour, whitened a ladys gums for a beauty contest and sealed that wide gap between a mans front teeth for a photo shoot.

More than a mouthful tells the stories behind those healthy teeth that you see on TV or on the ramp. Mayekar has stayed up nights, sometimes travelled miles, to address an emergency. He has assuaged patients fears with as much clinical care as personal concern. It is also the tale of one mans determination to master his craft and lay the foundation of aesthetic dentistry in India is a journey that has taken him from humble beginnings in a chawl in Mumbai to the swanky bandstand at Bandra.

Written with compassion and laced with wit, more than a mouthful is what the doctor prescribes to rid you of that fear of the dentist.",More Than A Mouthful,Sandesh Mayekar, , ,Collins,9789351369745,"1st,2014",332,India,English

Managers graduate from ‘What does my boss want?’ to ‘What does the CEO really want from me?’ through the course of their working lives as they ascend the corporate ladder. This question now requires an answer more than ever as interactions with the managers become frequent at the workplace.

In the book What the CEO Really Wants from You : The 4 As For Managerial Success, Gopalakrishnan’s answer is the 4 A’s: Accomplishment, Affability, Advocacy and Authenticity, that he fits together quite well. He illustrates each A with simple examples and case studies as explained in the foreword by Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever. Gopalakrishnan explains that managers need to be Accomplished by delivering results, which includes coordination with workers and execution of tasks effectively. The 2nd A is to be affable by getting along with co-workers and subordinates. This includes the ability to push people into delivering results and being able to put personal opinions aside while being part of a team. The 3rd A stands for advocacy which he explains is the skill of a manager in being able exercise his influence without employees having to report to him even as his role is elevated in the company. Finally there is authenticity which would determine his/her true value based on what the person stands for.

One of the most important things that the author lays emphasis on is how the key to success is knowing how to balance personal goals and handling the work environment which includes relationships with the boss and colleagues. The author derives his explanations from the Harvard Business School, Ramayana, neuroscience, storytelling and states examples of Sarath Fonseka, former army chief of Sri Lanka, Coriolanus of Shakespeare and Darbari Seth among others to show how the 4 A’s impact executives.

What the CEO Really Wants from You : The 4 As For Managerial Success includes case studies from companies like ISRO, Pfizer, Goldman Sachs, Hindustan Unilever and Tata Group. The book will be very useful for young managers who are just stepping into management.

Is gel better than foaming cleanser for shaving? Will a higher SPF keep your skin from tanning? Should you exfoliate or peel? Is it possible to get really clean without soap? How far does diet impact skin quality? Can moisturisers make your acne worse? Is brown skin more prone to sensitivity and pigmentation? Is there anything you can do about the circles or bags under your eyes? Shaving or waxing: what's better? What can you do about your oily scalp? Is it true that brown skin ages slowly? Can you slow down the ageing further? Sharad P. Paul, internationally renowned, award-winning cutaneous oncologist and skin surgeon, found in the course of his research that brown skin is not the same as white skin. But the multibillion-dollar cosmetics industry is also calibrated towards the care of white skin. It is no wonder then that the Caucasian image is sold as the beauty ideal. Paul's research, fuelled by his passion for Dermocracy - as he calls it - proved that not all of these regimens worked for brown skin, and some of them were actually harmful. He also found that Indians were by and large (incorrectly) recycling the beauty advice that flows in from the West. Dermocracy distils his key findings on caring for brown skin, and is a serious attempt to realign ideas surrounding skincare practice. It is, equally, a handy and easy guide to great skin.
