Artemis Fowl And The Lost Colony New Ed Edition continues to narrate the adventures of Artemis Fowl, who was once a teenage criminal mastermind. The series recounts how humans and fairies were involved in a great battle hundred centuries ago. When the fairies comprehended that their struggle against humans was pointless, they withdrew to the underground. But demons, who also battled against humans, stayed behind and attempted to reorganize an attack against the humans. Their attempt is foiled and the demons ended up in Limbo, getting stewed for the last ten thousand years. However, the spell holding them down is weakening and the world is at the verge of a grand demonic invasion. It again befalls Artemis Fowl and his pal, Captain Holly Short, to save their people.

The book begins with Artemis Fowl II and his bodyguard, Butler, waiting for a demon in Barcelona, Spain. Artemis predicts a demon appearance at Massimo Bellini Opera House and Artemis, Butler, and Holly go there. Here, the trio again spots the pretty, blond girl that they bumped into in Barcelona.

Artemis later finds out that the girl is his rival, a twelve-year old French prodigy who identifies herself as Minerva Paradizo. As Artemis predicts, a confused demon called No1 appears at the theatre and he is immediately captured by Minerva and her henchmen. No1 then reveals everything about demonic customs to Minerva and a sequence of events follow which involves Minerva being held hostage by the demons and Artemis rescuing her and managing to save the world. In Artemis Fowl And The Lost Colony New Edition, Artemis faces not only a race against time but also an insatiable, demon warlord. Besides this, he also has to combat a rival who happens to be very pretty.

The book has been written to evoke laughter in the bleakest situations. Colfer has used the combination of mythology and modern equipment to create a world of fantasy and has added suspense, romance, and sentiment to produce a masterwork.
