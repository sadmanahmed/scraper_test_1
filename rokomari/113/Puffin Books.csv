Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever traces how Greg Heffley just cannot catch a break. With Christmas looming, the pressure to be on his best behaviour and get into Santa’s good books is just too high. The book continues to chart the hilarious situations that Greg gets into despite his best attempts to avoid them. In portraying Greg’s antics, it keeps alive the innocence and mischief of the protagonist.

An addiction to the online game, Net Kritterz, and Greg's desire to keep his virtual online pet alive, spark a series of events that could turn Greg either into a hero or a villain. These events could land Greg into trouble with the authorities, although he is not sure if that is worse than being snowed in with his family. Get rich schemes that backfire, a sibling rivalry that keeps going up a notch, a secret so dark it could destroy him, and Greg is in the midst of it all.

Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever deals with every child's anxiety over the holiday season. The classic conflict of being a good child versus a child's innate desire to follow natural instincts is well portrayed by Kinney and will have readers reminiscing their childhood.

Published in 2011, Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever by Jeff Kinney is amongst the fastest selling books of 2011 and Amulet Books stated that the book was one of their most significant titles of the year.

This book garnered rave reviews amongst critics and was nominated for a 2012 Harvey Award for Special Award for Humor in Comics. Publishers Weekly lauded the book and Kinney’s writing. Jeff Kinney won the Best Author Children's Choice Award from the Children's Book Council in 2012 for this book.

When the learned Brahmin, Vishnugupta, is humiliated by the arrogant king, Dhana Nanda, in a public gathering, he swears revenge. Anger is his weakness, but strategy, his strength. This formerly unknown Brahmin goes on to become the most well-known kingmaker in Indian history: Chanakya. Using a combination of cunning, ruthlessness and luck, Chanakya fulfils his vow and propels a boy of unknown origins, Chandragupta Maurya, to the throne of the most powerful kingdom of that time, an empire even Alexander the Great hesitated to confront.

This fascinating account shows how Chanakya went from being a penniless fugitive with the rebel prince of Pataliputra to the prime minister of Magadha, and finally the author of the groundbreaking Arthashastra. With fun snippets and lesser-known facts about Chanakya and the Mauryan age, this book promises to be an exciting and gripping adventure story.

While he is dealing with all this, his Uncle Gary is preparing for his fourth marriage. As a class assignment, he has to take care of an egg. He also has to deal with a lazy maid at home who shirks most of her work and takes naps on Greg’s bed. Things just proceed from bad to worse, with Greg’s dad spraining his ankle, and a supervised slumber party turning into a disaster. Also, Greg finds that his dentist appointment is not at the center that he likes, but with a paranoid and irritable dentist.

Meet Percy Jackson. He is twelve years old, and he decides to tell us the story of his past year. On the first day of summer, just after his sixth-grade year, Percy discovers that something is wrong with him. Or rather, something is right with him. He learns that he is a half-blood: half-human, half-god. He is taken to Camp Half-Blood in New York, a camp for kids just like him that is safe from monsters that like to attack half-bloods. 

At camp, Percy learns more information about himself: his father is Poseidon, god of the Sea and brother to Zeus and Hades. When Zeus's master bolt (the thing that allows him to create lightning whenever he wants) is stolen, Poseidon is blamed for the theft. Zeus tells Poseidon that the master bolt must be returned to Mount Olympus by the summer solstice, or else he will declare war on Poseidon. Poseidon is miffed that his brother Zeus would even accuse him of such a thing.

Percy sets out on a quest to retrieve Zeus's master bolt, which is believed to be in Hades's captivity in the Underworld. Helping Percy are Grover, his BFF, and Annabeth, a smart demi-goddess and daughter of Athena. The three take a bus, a train, a truck, and a taxi cab to make their way across America, from New York to Los Angeles, where the gates of the Underworld are located. They stop in St. Louis, Denver, and Las Vegas along the way. During their quest, they battle vicious monsters like Medusa, they find disaster on the observation deck of the Gateway Arch, they are tricked by the god of war (Ares), they nearly lose their memories in an enchanted Vegas casino, and they are almost stretched to death.

Once in the Underworld, Percy finds that Hades does not have Zeus's master bolt, and he is missing his own symbol of power: the helm of darkness. Hades accuses Percy of stealing both the master bolt and the helm of darkness for his father, Poseidon. He accuses Poseidon of being power-hungry. To make things worse, the master bolt magically appears in Percy's backpack while he is talking to Hades. 

After escaping Hades's wrath, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover encounter Ares, the god of war, on the Santa Monica beach. Percy questions Ares and discovers that Ares stole the master bolt and helm of darkness from the original thief (whose name we don't yet know). Ares has been tempted by the possibility of sparking one of the biggest wars of all time between the Big Three: Hades, Zeus, and Poseidon. Percy and Ares battle it out on the beach, and Percy wounds Ares, winning the helm of darkness. Ares curses Percy. 

Percy returns the helm of darkness to Hades and takes a plane to New York City where he finds Mount Olympus on the 600th floor of the Empire State Building. Percy meets Poseidon and Zeus for the first time and tells them everything that he knows and suspects. He tells them that he believes Kronos, king of the Titans who ruled in the age before the Greek gods, is getting ready to wage war on the Olympians (the Greek gods and goddesses). Percy has been having dreams about Kronos in which Kronos talks to him. Zeus doesn't want to hear it. Poseidon tells Percy that he is proud of him and that he must make a choice when he goes home to his mom's apartment in Queens, NY.

That summer at Camp Half-Blood, Percy has a great time living the life of a hero. He procrastinates making a decision about whether he will stay at Camp Half-Blood year round, or whether he will go home and live with his mom in Queens. 

On the last day of camp, Percy is lured into the woods by his friend, Luke. Luke confesses to Percy that he was the original thief of the master bolt and the helm of darkness. He tells Percy that he serves Kronos and that Kronos is planning to defeat the Olympians and get rid of them. Luke vanishes, leaving a deadly scorpion to sting Percy. Percy nearly dies from this scorpion bite, but is rescued by wood nymphs who take him to safety. Percy's teacher, Chiron, nurses him back to health. Percy decides to go home and live with his mother for his seventh-grade year.",Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief,Rick Riordan, , ,Puffin Books,9780141346809,"Edition,2016",375,India,English

An Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments with Truth by Mohandas K. Gandhi traces Gandhi's life from his birth in Porbandar until the end of 1920, after his policy of non-cooperation with government is passed by the All-India Congress Committee. Gandhi says that at this point, his life has become so public that there is no need for him to write about it. The book is basically about how Gandhi arrives at the principles he holds and how they come about from his search for and belief in truth.

The story begins with Gandhi's childhood in the Porbandar and Rajkot. He is educated in the local schools until he finishes high school. While still in high school at the age of 13, in an arranged marriage, Gandhi marries a woman named Kasturbai, who stands by him his whole life. He is excited about the marriage at the time but both Gandhi and Kasturbai are against early marriages for their children. His father dies when he is sixteen and still in school. Gandhi finishes high school and goes on to study at Samaldas College, a local college located in Bhavnagar. He stays for just one semester and then decides to go to England where he can become a barrister in three years. Gandhi's mother is against the idea and to get her approval, Gandhi has to take a vow to not touch wine, women or meat while away. Gandhi reads for his exams, passes them, enrolls in the High Court and returns to India.

Gandhi is unsure of himself practicing law in India. He tries to intervene with an acquaintance, now the Political Agent in England, on behalf of his brother and they have sharp words. Gandhi's career is in jeopardy since appeals go to the Political Agent. Gandhi accepts an offer from a law firm in South Africa to help them with a case and after spending one year there he decides to stay there to help the Indian community. He works in South Africa until just two weeks prior to the outbreak of WWI in 1914. Back in India, he continues his public work, having already made a name for himself from his work in South Africa with Satyagraha, or civil disobedience and resistance by non-violent methods.

Gandhi's book accurately reflects the general goal and intent of his life - the search for truth and his firm belief in that truth. He believes that truth is God and all his experiments concern his attempts to achieve truth and purity. His experiments with dietetics are a life-long deal, and he seeks to find the perfect diet - one that wipes out lust and allows man to control his mind and thoughts. Within this framework he develops his principles for government reform. This consists of agitation through the use of civil disobedience and resistance without resorting to violence. One cannot practice civil disobedience without knowing and respecting the laws of the land since one must chose which laws to disobey and when. The uneducated can't do this, which is why the national day of hartal resulted in violence. The population hadn't been taught the principles of civil disobedience. Gandhi ends his book in 1920 during the period of agitation and non-cooperation. The events of his life are well-known after that point. (bookrags.com)",My Experiments with Truth,M. K.

In a small Buckinghamshire village, Matilda Wormwood is a five-and-half-year-old girl of unusual precocity, but her parents treat her with disdain. She resorts to pranks such as gluing her father's hat to his head, hiding a friend's parrot in the chimney to simulate a burglar or ghost, and secretly bleaching her father's hair, to get revenge on her parents for being so mean to her. Matilda has read a variety of books by different authors, especially at the age of four, when she read many in six months.

At school, Matilda befriends her teacher, Jennifer Honey, who is astonished by Matilda's intellectual abilities. She tries to move her into a higher class but is refused by the headmistress, the tyrannical Miss Agatha Trunchbull. Miss Honey also tries to talk to Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood about Matilda's intelligence, but they ignore her.

Matilda quickly develops a particularly strong bond with Miss Honey and watches as Miss Trunchbull terrorizes her students with creative, over-the-top punishments. When Matilda's friend, Lavender, plays a practical joke on Miss Trunchbull by placing a newt in her jug of water, Matilda uses an unexpected power of telekinesis to tip the glass of water containing the newt onto Miss Trunchbull.

After Matilda reveals her powers to Miss Honey, Miss Honey confides that she was raised by an abusive aunt after the suspicious death of her father. Her aunt is revealed to be Miss Trunchbull, who appears (among other misdeeds) to be withholding her niece's inheritance so that Miss Honey has to live in poverty in a derelict farm cottage. Preparing to avenge Miss Honey, Matilda develops her telekinetic gift through practice at home. Later, during a lesson that Miss Trunchbull is teaching, Matilda telekinetically raises a piece of chalk to the blackboard and writes on it, posing as the spirit of Miss Honey's late father and demanding that Miss Trunchbull hand over Miss Honey's house and wages and leave the region forever.

This is soon done, and a short while later the school's deputy head teacher, Mr. Trilby, visits Miss Trunchbull's house but finds it empty with no sign of her next destination. As Mr. Trilby becomes the new head of the school, he proves himself to be capable and good-natured, with the result that Matilda herself advances to the highest level of schooling. Rather to her relief, she is no longer capable of telekinesis; this is explained by Miss Honey as the result of using her mind on a more challenging curriculum. Matilda continues to visit Miss Honey at her house regularly, but one day finds her parents and her older brother Michael hastily packing to escape from the police, who are after her father for selling stolen cars. Matilda asks permission to live with Miss Honey, to which her parents rather uninterestedly agree. So both she and Miss Honey find their happy ending, and the school's atmosphere and curriculum have overwhelmingly improved under Mr. Trilby.

Heroes Of Olympus: The Son Of Neptune takes the story forward from where the previous novel in the series The Lost Hero ended. As Percy Jackson wakes up from his long sleep, he is confused and does not remember much from his past. The only thing he remembers is his name and a person from his past with the name Annabeth.

As the son of Poseidon, Percy Jackson wakes up to the reality of his life that is a chaotic world of monsters, gods, and demigods. He realizes that he is followed by two snake-haired women who are hard to get rid of. He travels to the camp for the half-bloods which confuses him as he does not understand his purpose yet.

He meets the wolf Lupa who informs him about his true identity, that of a demigod and teaches him how to use his pocket sword to fight. Still, Percy’s mind does not give him any clear clues about his past and the vision is still blurred. The only thing the reader is sure about is that the quest followed by Percy and other demigods Hazel and Frank – the one that began in the previous books of the series – is still on. The search for the Prophesy of Seven has to be accomplished at any cost. They cannot fail in their mission or else many lives and the world might be on the verge of complete destruction.

Heroes Of Olympus: The Son Of Neptune begins with another camp for half-bloods and takes the reader to the land that is much beyond that of the gods. It brings into action new creatures including demigods and frightening monsters who have a role to play in the Prophesy of Seven. And thus, like its previous volumes, even this one is fascinating enough to keep the reader hooked till the last page. Heroes Of Olympus: The Son Of Neptune was well received, and it was listed on the bestsellers list of USA Today, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal. It has sold more than three million copies.

Rick Riordan’s The Last Olympian is the fifth and final installment of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. Published in 2009, this fantasy children’s book was a #1 bestseller on the lists of USA Today, the LA Times, and the Wall Street Journal. The novel follows the teenage demigod Percy Jackson, son of Poseidon and of a mortal woman. He and other demigods spend their summers at Camp Half-Blood, located in Long Island, NY.

When the novel opens, two sets of Greek gods are at war: the original race of gods, the Titans, versus the Olympians, their descendants. The demigods fight on the side of the Olympians, whose home, Mount Olympus, is located on the 600th floor of the Empire State Building in Manhattan, NY.

In the first scene of the novel, Percy and his fellow demigod Charles Beckendorf infiltrate Kronos’s ship. The latter is the Titan god of time, and he is leading the fight against the Olympians. Kronos has overtaken the body of Luke Castellan, a demigod who has bathed in the River Styx to become invulnerable. Although Percy and Charles succeed in blowing up the ship, Charles dies before he escapes.

Percy returns to Camp Half-Blood, where he encounters his mentor Chiron (a centaur) and love interest Annabeth Chase (daughter of Athena). The Oracle of Delphi, in the form of a mummified doll, reveals the Great Prophecy—the hero will make a choice to ensure the ultimate success or destruction of Olympus, a choice which will ensure the hero’s demise. Although it appears as though Percy is the hero mentioned in the prophecy, the author later reveals that it is Luke.

Once deciding to accept the Prophecy, Percy goes on a journey with Nico di Angelo, son of Hades, to learn more about Luke’s background in order to better be able to defeat him. They visit May Castellan, Luke’s mother, who has lost touch with reality. She is a mortal but has the gift of prophecy and tried to take on the role of the new Oracle of Delphi but was cursed.

Percy and Nico next journey to Central Park, which offers a passage to the Underworld. While there, they meet up with Grover Underwood, a satyr and Percy’s best friend. Grover becomes instrumental in helping lead the war efforts. Percy and Nico descend into the Underworld, and Percy bathes in the River Styx, rendering him invulnerable save for a patch on his lower back.

Next, Percy meets his fellow demigods at the Empire State Building. Their main objective is to keep the Titans away from Mount Olympus. They devise a plan to block off all of the entrances to Manhattan, and the various teams disperse. Percy and Annabeth stick together.

The demigods fight several battles against various monsters, such as the Clazmonian Sow, the Lydian pig, and the drakon. They force Kronos’s army back, but the fight wages on. During the battle, Rachel Dare, a mortal with the gift of sight, arrives to tell Percy that he is not the hero in the Prophecy. Rachel is another one of Percy’s love interests.

Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and Thalia finally go to Mount Olympus in a last-ditch effort to defend it. The city is crumbling around them, and Kronos has entered the throne room. Percy fights him, and Annabeth speaks to Luke, whose spirit is still present in Kronos. Annabeth and Luke have a history together, and she is able to get him to turn against Kronos and defeat him. Luke uses his own sword to kill Kronos, effectively killing himself. In this way, Luke fulfills the Prophecy.

Everyone returns to Camp Half-Blood to tend to the wounded and give burials to the dead. Rachel becomes the new Oracle of Delphi and tells Percy that they cannot be together. Percy confesses his feelings to Annabeth, and they two become a couple. The book ends as summer draws to a close, and the various demigods leave to go back to school in the normal world.

Pride and Prejudice is set in rural England in the early 19th century, and it follows the Bennet family, which includes five very different sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious to see all her daughters married, especially as the modest family estate is to be inherited by William Collins when Mr. Bennet dies. At a ball, the wealthy and newly arrived Charles Bingley takes an immediate interest in the eldest Bennet daughter, the beautiful and shy Jane. The encounter between his friend Darcy and Elizabeth is less cordial. Although Austen shows them intrigued by each other, she reverses the convention of first impressions: pride of rank and fortune and prejudice against the social inferiority of Elizabeth’s family hold Darcy aloof, while Elizabeth is equally fired both by the pride of self-respect and by prejudice against Darcy’s snobbery.
The pompous Collins subsequently arrives, hoping to marry one of the Bennet sisters. Elizabeth, however, refuses his offer of marriage, and he instead becomes engaged to her friend Charlotte Lucas. During this time, Elizabeth encounters the charming George Wickham, a military officer. There is a mutual attraction between the two, and he informs her that Darcy has denied him his inheritance.
After Bingley abruptly departs for London, Elizabeth’s dislike of Darcy increases as she becomes convinced that he is discouraging Bingley’s relationship with Jane. Darcy, however, has grown increasingly fond of Elizabeth, admiring her intelligence and vitality. While visiting the now-married Charlotte, Elizabeth sees Darcy, who professes his love for her and proposes. A surprised Elizabeth refuses his offer, and, when Darcy demands an explanation, she accuses him of breaking up Jane and Bingley. Darcy subsequently writes Elizabeth a letter in which he explains that he separated the couple largely because he did not believe Jane returned Bingley’s affection. He also discloses that Wickham, after squandering his inheritance, tried to marry Darcy’s then 15-year-old sister in an attempt to gain possession of her fortune. With these revelations, Elizabeth begins to see Darcy in a new light.
Shortly thereafter the youngest Bennet sister, Lydia, elopes with Wickham. The news is met with great alarm by Elizabeth, since the scandalous affair—which is unlikely to end in marriage—could ruin the reputation of the other Bennet sisters. When she tells Darcy, he persuades Wickham to marry Lydia, offering him money. Despite Darcy’s attempt to keep his intervention a secret, Elizabeth learns of his actions. At the encouragement of Darcy, Bingley subsequently returns, and he and Jane become engaged. Finally, Darcy proposes again to Elizabeth, who this time accepts.",Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen, , ,Puffin Books,9780141330167,"1st Edition,1995",439,India,English

Percy Jackson is pretty ordinary for a 12 year old. Besides the ADHD and dyslexia, he's normal. Or almost as normal as a son of Poseidon can be anyway. Expelled from almost every school he has ever been to, he has no reason to think Yancy Academy is any different. A school trip changes everything as his teacher, Mrs. Dodds, turns into one of the three Furies straight out of Greek legends and attacks him. After being saved by his Latin teacher, everyone forgets Mrs. Dodds, Percy learns that his closest friend is a Satyr and that he is the son of Poseidon, the Greek God. With barely any time to come to terms about his demigod status, Percy faces dangers and wonders from the old books, not being able to believe what he is experiencing. He has no time though, blamed for stealing Zeus's lightning bolt, he needs to clear his name before Zeus manages to find him. And to do that he needs to find the Lightning Thief.

Some years ago, when my own children were small, we usually kept a tortoise or two in the garden. In those days, a pet tortoise was a common sight crawling about on the family lawn or in the back yard. You could buy them quite cheaply in any pet-shop and they were probably the least troublesome of all childhood pets, and quite harmless.
Tortoises used to be brought into England by the thousand, packed in crates, and they came mostly from North Africa. But not many years ago a law was passed that made it illegal to bring any tortoises into the country. This was not done to protect us. The little tortoise was not a danger to anybody. It was done purely out of kindness to the tortoise itself. You see, the traders who brought them in used to cram hundreds of them tightly into the packing-crates without food or water and in such horrible conditions that a great many of them always died on the seajourney over. So rather than allow this cruelty to go on, the Government stopped the whole business.
The things you are going to read about in this story all happened in the days when anyone could go out and buy a nice little tortoise from a pet-shop.",Esio Trot (Last of Dahl's Books),Roald Dahl, , ,Puffin Books,9780141365480,"1st Edition,2016",71,India,English

The central figure of this book is the eccentric genius Professor Trilokeshwar Shonku, who is the son of physicist Tripureshwar Shonku. Along with Newton, his 24 year old pet cat, Prahlad, his loyal servant, and Bidhushekhar, his robot, Professor Shonku had left for the planet Mars in his rocket from Giridih. After their departure, they have not been traced.

A journal, found by a poor man, who later gives it to the editor of Sandesh reveals the various exploits of Professor Shonku and his companions in space. The editor learns how Professor Shonku’s plan of reaching Mars was laughed at by his neighbour, and how, upon reaching Mars, they were attacked by unfriendly Martians.

Professor Shonku and the others escape from Mars and are lost for some time wandering in space, until they reach the planet of Tafa, whose inhabitants are apparently the first civilized humans of the solar system. Unlike their welcome on Mars, Professor Shonku and the others are welcomed in Tafa very warmly and Professor Shonku is made a fellow citizen.

Several other journals picked up from his laboratory reveal stories about a mad Norwegian scientist, an angry sadhu, and a vengeful mummy.

Published in 1984, Boy: Tales of Childhood, covers Dahl’s journey from his birth to the time he got his first job. Dahl recounts his days as a child. He includes stories of his early childhood, his family, his schooling, and goes up to his first job. While sharing these experiences, he also gives us a peek into the elements of his life which shaped him as a writer.

Like most of his books and short stories, Dahl’s book about his own life is entertaining and enjoyable. Boy: Tales Of Childhood begins with a short history about the author’s grandfather and father. The book details his father’s life, how his father lost his hand, how he ran off with his brother to make a fortune in a foreign land, his success, his marriages and his death.

Dahl recalls how his mother’s strong will and determination to fulfill his father’s dream of educating his children in England was the reason the young widow with 5 children, refused to go back to Norway. Dahl shares some fond memories of his childhood, his life as a child at home in England, and with his family in Norway.

Then comes Dahl’s experiences in English schools. At the age of 9, Dahl was put in a boarding school. The school life he has described is mostly unpleasant. Punishments and canings, and sadistic matrons and masters made life horrible for the kids. The pranks he played are humorous to read, and the punishments he got sound equally unpleasant.

The book ends with Roald Dahl’s first job at the Royal Dutch Shell. Through this autobiographical book, Dahl gives us a look at his own personal life, as well as the lives of the English people of his time, the living conditions, the education system, and their drawbacks. This edition has an attractive new cover and illustrations by Quentin Blake. There are black and white photos, and extracts of letters in Dahl’s own handwriting.

Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever traces how Greg Heffley just cannot catch a break. With Christmas looming, the pressure to be on his best behaviour and get into Santa’s good books is just too high. The book continues to chart the hilarious situations that Greg gets into despite his best attempts to avoid them. In portraying Greg’s antics, it keeps alive the innocence and mischief of the protagonist.

An addiction to the online game, Net Kritterz, and Greg's desire to keep his virtual online pet alive, spark a series of events that could turn Greg either into a hero or a villain. These events could land Greg into trouble with the authorities, although he is not sure if that is worse than being snowed in with his family. Get rich schemes that backfire, a sibling rivalry that keeps going up a notch, a secret so dark it could destroy him, and Greg is in the midst of it all.

Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever deals with every child's anxiety over the holiday season. The classic conflict of being a good child versus a child's innate desire to follow natural instincts is well portrayed by Kinney and will have readers reminiscing their childhood.

Published in 2011, Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever by Jeff Kinney is amongst the fastest selling books of 2011 and Amulet Books stated that the book was one of their most significant titles of the year.

This book garnered rave reviews amongst critics and was nominated for a 2012 Harvey Award for Special Award for Humor in Comics. Publishers Weekly lauded the book and Kinney’s writing. Jeff Kinney won the Best Author Children's Choice Award from the Children's Book Council in 2012 for this book.

When the learned Brahmin, Vishnugupta, is humiliated by the arrogant king, Dhana Nanda, in a public gathering, he swears revenge. Anger is his weakness, but strategy, his strength. This formerly unknown Brahmin goes on to become the most well-known kingmaker in Indian history: Chanakya. Using a combination of cunning, ruthlessness and luck, Chanakya fulfils his vow and propels a boy of unknown origins, Chandragupta Maurya, to the throne of the most powerful kingdom of that time, an empire even Alexander the Great hesitated to confront.

This fascinating account shows how Chanakya went from being a penniless fugitive with the rebel prince of Pataliputra to the prime minister of Magadha, and finally the author of the groundbreaking Arthashastra. With fun snippets and lesser-known facts about Chanakya and the Mauryan age, this book promises to be an exciting and gripping adventure story.

Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Ugly Truth picks up two weeks after Greg and Rowley stopped being friends. They are not even talking to each other and Rowley Jefferson’s parents have found a replacement best friend for him. They have got him a for-hire friend, called Cool Brian, designed to be a role model for a kid Rowley’s age.

Greg, meanwhile, has decided that he has had about enough of being a kid. He wants to grow up as soon as possible and leave his childhood behind. Unexpectedly, he gets an opportunity to show his grown up side.

Greg’s mother, Susan Heffley, has decided to return to college for a few months and asks her family to take good care of each other and their home, when she is away. Now, Greg is left responsible for waking himself up every morning on time, find clean clothes to wear when there are none, and deal with his home work on his own.

While he is dealing with all this, his Uncle Gary is preparing for his fourth marriage. As a class assignment, he has to take care of an egg. He also has to deal with a lazy maid at home who shirks most of her work and takes naps on Greg’s bed. Things just proceed from bad to worse, with Greg’s dad spraining his ankle, and a supervised slumber party turning into a disaster. Also, Greg finds that his dentist appointment is not at the center that he likes, but with a paranoid and irritable dentist.

Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Ugly Truth sold 548,000 books and was received positively.

Meet Percy Jackson. He is twelve years old, and he decides to tell us the story of his past year. On the first day of summer, just after his sixth-grade year, Percy discovers that something is wrong with him. Or rather, something is right with him. He learns that he is a half-blood: half-human, half-god. He is taken to Camp Half-Blood in New York, a camp for kids just like him that is safe from monsters that like to attack half-bloods. 

At camp, Percy learns more information about himself: his father is Poseidon, god of the Sea and brother to Zeus and Hades. When Zeus's master bolt (the thing that allows him to create lightning whenever he wants) is stolen, Poseidon is blamed for the theft. Zeus tells Poseidon that the master bolt must be returned to Mount Olympus by the summer solstice, or else he will declare war on Poseidon. Poseidon is miffed that his brother Zeus would even accuse him of such a thing.

Percy sets out on a quest to retrieve Zeus's master bolt, which is believed to be in Hades's captivity in the Underworld. Helping Percy are Grover, his BFF, and Annabeth, a smart demi-goddess and daughter of Athena. The three take a bus, a train, a truck, and a taxi cab to make their way across America, from New York to Los Angeles, where the gates of the Underworld are located. They stop in St. Louis, Denver, and Las Vegas along the way. During their quest, they battle vicious monsters like Medusa, they find disaster on the observation deck of the Gateway Arch, they are tricked by the god of war (Ares), they nearly lose their memories in an enchanted Vegas casino, and they are almost stretched to death.

Once in the Underworld, Percy finds that Hades does not have Zeus's master bolt, and he is missing his own symbol of power: the helm of darkness. Hades accuses Percy of stealing both the master bolt and the helm of darkness for his father, Poseidon. He accuses Poseidon of being power-hungry. To make things worse, the master bolt magically appears in Percy's backpack while he is talking to Hades. 

After escaping Hades's wrath, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover encounter Ares, the god of war, on the Santa Monica beach. Percy questions Ares and discovers that Ares stole the master bolt and helm of darkness from the original thief (whose name we don't yet know). Ares has been tempted by the possibility of sparking one of the biggest wars of all time between the Big Three: Hades, Zeus, and Poseidon. Percy and Ares battle it out on the beach, and Percy wounds Ares, winning the helm of darkness. Ares curses Percy. 

Percy returns the helm of darkness to Hades and takes a plane to New York City where he finds Mount Olympus on the 600th floor of the Empire State Building. Percy meets Poseidon and Zeus for the first time and tells them everything that he knows and suspects. He tells them that he believes Kronos, king of the Titans who ruled in the age before the Greek gods, is getting ready to wage war on the Olympians (the Greek gods and goddesses). Percy has been having dreams about Kronos in which Kronos talks to him. Zeus doesn't want to hear it. Poseidon tells Percy that he is proud of him and that he must make a choice when he goes home to his mom's apartment in Queens, NY.

That summer at Camp Half-Blood, Percy has a great time living the life of a hero. He procrastinates making a decision about whether he will stay at Camp Half-Blood year round, or whether he will go home and live with his mom in Queens. 

On the last day of camp, Percy is lured into the woods by his friend, Luke. Luke confesses to Percy that he was the original thief of the master bolt and the helm of darkness. He tells Percy that he serves Kronos and that Kronos is planning to defeat the Olympians and get rid of them. Luke vanishes, leaving a deadly scorpion to sting Percy. Percy nearly dies from this scorpion bite, but is rescued by wood nymphs who take him to safety. Percy's teacher, Chiron, nurses him back to health. Percy decides to go home and live with his mother for his seventh-grade year.",Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief,Rick Riordan, , ,Puffin Books,9780141346809,"Edition,2016",375,India,English

An Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments with Truth by Mohandas K. Gandhi traces Gandhi's life from his birth in Porbandar until the end of 1920, after his policy of non-cooperation with government is passed by the All-India Congress Committee. Gandhi says that at this point, his life has become so public that there is no need for him to write about it. The book is basically about how Gandhi arrives at the principles he holds and how they come about from his search for and belief in truth.

The story begins with Gandhi's childhood in the Porbandar and Rajkot. He is educated in the local schools until he finishes high school. While still in high school at the age of 13, in an arranged marriage, Gandhi marries a woman named Kasturbai, who stands by him his whole life. He is excited about the marriage at the time but both Gandhi and Kasturbai are against early marriages for their children. His father dies when he is sixteen and still in school. Gandhi finishes high school and goes on to study at Samaldas College, a local college located in Bhavnagar. He stays for just one semester and then decides to go to England where he can become a barrister in three years. Gandhi's mother is against the idea and to get her approval, Gandhi has to take a vow to not touch wine, women or meat while away. Gandhi reads for his exams, passes them, enrolls in the High Court and returns to India.

Gandhi is unsure of himself practicing law in India. He tries to intervene with an acquaintance, now the Political Agent in England, on behalf of his brother and they have sharp words. Gandhi's career is in jeopardy since appeals go to the Political Agent. Gandhi accepts an offer from a law firm in South Africa to help them with a case and after spending one year there he decides to stay there to help the Indian community. He works in South Africa until just two weeks prior to the outbreak of WWI in 1914. Back in India, he continues his public work, having already made a name for himself from his work in South Africa with Satyagraha, or civil disobedience and resistance by non-violent methods.

Gandhi's book accurately reflects the general goal and intent of his life - the search for truth and his firm belief in that truth. He believes that truth is God and all his experiments concern his attempts to achieve truth and purity. His experiments with dietetics are a life-long deal, and he seeks to find the perfect diet - one that wipes out lust and allows man to control his mind and thoughts. Within this framework he develops his principles for government reform. This consists of agitation through the use of civil disobedience and resistance without resorting to violence. One cannot practice civil disobedience without knowing and respecting the laws of the land since one must chose which laws to disobey and when. The uneducated can't do this, which is why the national day of hartal resulted in violence. The population hadn't been taught the principles of civil disobedience. Gandhi ends his book in 1920 during the period of agitation and non-cooperation. The events of his life are well-known after that point. (bookrags.com)",My Experiments with Truth,M. K.

In a small Buckinghamshire village, Matilda Wormwood is a five-and-half-year-old girl of unusual precocity, but her parents treat her with disdain. She resorts to pranks such as gluing her father's hat to his head, hiding a friend's parrot in the chimney to simulate a burglar or ghost, and secretly bleaching her father's hair, to get revenge on her parents for being so mean to her. Matilda has read a variety of books by different authors, especially at the age of four, when she read many in six months.

At school, Matilda befriends her teacher, Jennifer Honey, who is astonished by Matilda's intellectual abilities. She tries to move her into a higher class but is refused by the headmistress, the tyrannical Miss Agatha Trunchbull. Miss Honey also tries to talk to Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood about Matilda's intelligence, but they ignore her.

Matilda quickly develops a particularly strong bond with Miss Honey and watches as Miss Trunchbull terrorizes her students with creative, over-the-top punishments. When Matilda's friend, Lavender, plays a practical joke on Miss Trunchbull by placing a newt in her jug of water, Matilda uses an unexpected power of telekinesis to tip the glass of water containing the newt onto Miss Trunchbull.

After Matilda reveals her powers to Miss Honey, Miss Honey confides that she was raised by an abusive aunt after the suspicious death of her father. Her aunt is revealed to be Miss Trunchbull, who appears (among other misdeeds) to be withholding her niece's inheritance so that Miss Honey has to live in poverty in a derelict farm cottage. Preparing to avenge Miss Honey, Matilda develops her telekinetic gift through practice at home. Later, during a lesson that Miss Trunchbull is teaching, Matilda telekinetically raises a piece of chalk to the blackboard and writes on it, posing as the spirit of Miss Honey's late father and demanding that Miss Trunchbull hand over Miss Honey's house and wages and leave the region forever.

This is soon done, and a short while later the school's deputy head teacher, Mr. Trilby, visits Miss Trunchbull's house but finds it empty with no sign of her next destination. As Mr. Trilby becomes the new head of the school, he proves himself to be capable and good-natured, with the result that Matilda herself advances to the highest level of schooling. Rather to her relief, she is no longer capable of telekinesis; this is explained by Miss Honey as the result of using her mind on a more challenging curriculum. Matilda continues to visit Miss Honey at her house regularly, but one day finds her parents and her older brother Michael hastily packing to escape from the police, who are after her father for selling stolen cars. Matilda asks permission to live with Miss Honey, to which her parents rather uninterestedly agree. So both she and Miss Honey find their happy ending, and the school's atmosphere and curriculum have overwhelmingly improved under Mr. Trilby.

Heroes Of Olympus: The Son Of Neptune takes the story forward from where the previous novel in the series The Lost Hero ended. As Percy Jackson wakes up from his long sleep, he is confused and does not remember much from his past. The only thing he remembers is his name and a person from his past with the name Annabeth.

As the son of Poseidon, Percy Jackson wakes up to the reality of his life that is a chaotic world of monsters, gods, and demigods. He realizes that he is followed by two snake-haired women who are hard to get rid of. He travels to the camp for the half-bloods which confuses him as he does not understand his purpose yet.

He meets the wolf Lupa who informs him about his true identity, that of a demigod and teaches him how to use his pocket sword to fight. Still, Percy’s mind does not give him any clear clues about his past and the vision is still blurred. The only thing the reader is sure about is that the quest followed by Percy and other demigods Hazel and Frank – the one that began in the previous books of the series – is still on. The search for the Prophesy of Seven has to be accomplished at any cost. They cannot fail in their mission or else many lives and the world might be on the verge of complete destruction.

Heroes Of Olympus: The Son Of Neptune begins with another camp for half-bloods and takes the reader to the land that is much beyond that of the gods. It brings into action new creatures including demigods and frightening monsters who have a role to play in the Prophesy of Seven. And thus, like its previous volumes, even this one is fascinating enough to keep the reader hooked till the last page. Heroes Of Olympus: The Son Of Neptune was well received, and it was listed on the bestsellers list of USA Today, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal. It has sold more than three million copies.

Rick Riordan’s The Last Olympian is the fifth and final installment of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. Published in 2009, this fantasy children’s book was a #1 bestseller on the lists of USA Today, the LA Times, and the Wall Street Journal. The novel follows the teenage demigod Percy Jackson, son of Poseidon and of a mortal woman. He and other demigods spend their summers at Camp Half-Blood, located in Long Island, NY.

When the novel opens, two sets of Greek gods are at war: the original race of gods, the Titans, versus the Olympians, their descendants. The demigods fight on the side of the Olympians, whose home, Mount Olympus, is located on the 600th floor of the Empire State Building in Manhattan, NY.

In the first scene of the novel, Percy and his fellow demigod Charles Beckendorf infiltrate Kronos’s ship. The latter is the Titan god of time, and he is leading the fight against the Olympians. Kronos has overtaken the body of Luke Castellan, a demigod who has bathed in the River Styx to become invulnerable. Although Percy and Charles succeed in blowing up the ship, Charles dies before he escapes.

Percy returns to Camp Half-Blood, where he encounters his mentor Chiron (a centaur) and love interest Annabeth Chase (daughter of Athena). The Oracle of Delphi, in the form of a mummified doll, reveals the Great Prophecy—the hero will make a choice to ensure the ultimate success or destruction of Olympus, a choice which will ensure the hero’s demise. Although it appears as though Percy is the hero mentioned in the prophecy, the author later reveals that it is Luke.

Once deciding to accept the Prophecy, Percy goes on a journey with Nico di Angelo, son of Hades, to learn more about Luke’s background in order to better be able to defeat him. They visit May Castellan, Luke’s mother, who has lost touch with reality. She is a mortal but has the gift of prophecy and tried to take on the role of the new Oracle of Delphi but was cursed.

Percy and Nico next journey to Central Park, which offers a passage to the Underworld. While there, they meet up with Grover Underwood, a satyr and Percy’s best friend. Grover becomes instrumental in helping lead the war efforts. Percy and Nico descend into the Underworld, and Percy bathes in the River Styx, rendering him invulnerable save for a patch on his lower back.

Next, Percy meets his fellow demigods at the Empire State Building. Their main objective is to keep the Titans away from Mount Olympus. They devise a plan to block off all of the entrances to Manhattan, and the various teams disperse. Percy and Annabeth stick together.

The demigods fight several battles against various monsters, such as the Clazmonian Sow, the Lydian pig, and the drakon. They force Kronos’s army back, but the fight wages on. During the battle, Rachel Dare, a mortal with the gift of sight, arrives to tell Percy that he is not the hero in the Prophecy. Rachel is another one of Percy’s love interests.

Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and Thalia finally go to Mount Olympus in a last-ditch effort to defend it. The city is crumbling around them, and Kronos has entered the throne room. Percy fights him, and Annabeth speaks to Luke, whose spirit is still present in Kronos. Annabeth and Luke have a history together, and she is able to get him to turn against Kronos and defeat him. Luke uses his own sword to kill Kronos, effectively killing himself. In this way, Luke fulfills the Prophecy.

Everyone returns to Camp Half-Blood to tend to the wounded and give burials to the dead. Rachel becomes the new Oracle of Delphi and tells Percy that they cannot be together. Percy confesses his feelings to Annabeth, and they two become a couple. The book ends as summer draws to a close, and the various demigods leave to go back to school in the normal world.

Pride and Prejudice is set in rural England in the early 19th century, and it follows the Bennet family, which includes five very different sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious to see all her daughters married, especially as the modest family estate is to be inherited by William Collins when Mr. Bennet dies. At a ball, the wealthy and newly arrived Charles Bingley takes an immediate interest in the eldest Bennet daughter, the beautiful and shy Jane. The encounter between his friend Darcy and Elizabeth is less cordial. Although Austen shows them intrigued by each other, she reverses the convention of first impressions: pride of rank and fortune and prejudice against the social inferiority of Elizabeth’s family hold Darcy aloof, while Elizabeth is equally fired both by the pride of self-respect and by prejudice against Darcy’s snobbery.
The pompous Collins subsequently arrives, hoping to marry one of the Bennet sisters. Elizabeth, however, refuses his offer of marriage, and he instead becomes engaged to her friend Charlotte Lucas. During this time, Elizabeth encounters the charming George Wickham, a military officer. There is a mutual attraction between the two, and he informs her that Darcy has denied him his inheritance.
After Bingley abruptly departs for London, Elizabeth’s dislike of Darcy increases as she becomes convinced that he is discouraging Bingley’s relationship with Jane. Darcy, however, has grown increasingly fond of Elizabeth, admiring her intelligence and vitality. While visiting the now-married Charlotte, Elizabeth sees Darcy, who professes his love for her and proposes. A surprised Elizabeth refuses his offer, and, when Darcy demands an explanation, she accuses him of breaking up Jane and Bingley. Darcy subsequently writes Elizabeth a letter in which he explains that he separated the couple largely because he did not believe Jane returned Bingley’s affection. He also discloses that Wickham, after squandering his inheritance, tried to marry Darcy’s then 15-year-old sister in an attempt to gain possession of her fortune. With these revelations, Elizabeth begins to see Darcy in a new light.
Shortly thereafter the youngest Bennet sister, Lydia, elopes with Wickham. The news is met with great alarm by Elizabeth, since the scandalous affair—which is unlikely to end in marriage—could ruin the reputation of the other Bennet sisters. When she tells Darcy, he persuades Wickham to marry Lydia, offering him money. Despite Darcy’s attempt to keep his intervention a secret, Elizabeth learns of his actions. At the encouragement of Darcy, Bingley subsequently returns, and he and Jane become engaged.

Percy Jackson is pretty ordinary for a 12 year old. Besides the ADHD and dyslexia, he's normal. Or almost as normal as a son of Poseidon can be anyway. Expelled from almost every school he has ever been to, he has no reason to think Yancy Academy is any different. A school trip changes everything as his teacher, Mrs. Dodds, turns into one of the three Furies straight out of Greek legends and attacks him. After being saved by his Latin teacher, everyone forgets Mrs. Dodds, Percy learns that his closest friend is a Satyr and that he is the son of Poseidon, the Greek God. With barely any time to come to terms about his demigod status, Percy faces dangers and wonders from the old books, not being able to believe what he is experiencing. He has no time though, blamed for stealing Zeus's lightning bolt, he needs to clear his name before Zeus manages to find him. And to do that he needs to find the Lightning Thief.

Some years ago, when my own children were small, we usually kept a tortoise or two in the garden. In those days, a pet tortoise was a common sight crawling about on the family lawn or in the back yard. You could buy them quite cheaply in any pet-shop and they were probably the least troublesome of all childhood pets, and quite harmless.
Tortoises used to be brought into England by the thousand, packed in crates, and they came mostly from North Africa. But not many years ago a law was passed that made it illegal to bring any tortoises into the country. This was not done to protect us. The little tortoise was not a danger to anybody. It was done purely out of kindness to the tortoise itself. You see, the traders who brought them in used to cram hundreds of them tightly into the packing-crates without food or water and in such horrible conditions that a great many of them always died on the seajourney over. So rather than allow this cruelty to go on, the Government stopped the whole business.
The things you are going to read about in this story all happened in the days when anyone could go out and buy a nice little tortoise from a pet-shop.",Esio Trot (Last of Dahl's Books),Roald Dahl, , ,Puffin Books,9780141365480,"1st Edition,2016",71,India,English

The central figure of this book is the eccentric genius Professor Trilokeshwar Shonku, who is the son of physicist Tripureshwar Shonku. Along with Newton, his 24 year old pet cat, Prahlad, his loyal servant, and Bidhushekhar, his robot, Professor Shonku had left for the planet Mars in his rocket from Giridih. After their departure, they have not been traced.

A journal, found by a poor man, who later gives it to the editor of Sandesh reveals the various exploits of Professor Shonku and his companions in space. The editor learns how Professor Shonku’s plan of reaching Mars was laughed at by his neighbour, and how, upon reaching Mars, they were attacked by unfriendly Martians.

Professor Shonku and the others escape from Mars and are lost for some time wandering in space, until they reach the planet of Tafa, whose inhabitants are apparently the first civilized humans of the solar system. Unlike their welcome on Mars, Professor Shonku and the others are welcomed in Tafa very warmly and Professor Shonku is made a fellow citizen.

Several other journals picked up from his laboratory reveal stories about a mad Norwegian scientist, an angry sadhu, and a vengeful mummy.

Rick Riordan is a teacher and a writer, and has won many awards for his mystery novels for adults. He says that the idea for Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief first came to him while he was teaching Greek mythology at middle school in San Francisco. But rumour has it that Camp Half Blood actually exists, and Rick spends his summers there recording the adventures of young demigods. Some believe that, to avoid a mass panic among the mortal population, he was forced to swear on the River Styx to present Percy Jackson's story as fiction.

Published in 1984, Boy: Tales of Childhood, covers Dahl’s journey from his birth to the time he got his first job. Dahl recounts his days as a child. He includes stories of his early childhood, his family, his schooling, and goes up to his first job. While sharing these experiences, he also gives us a peek into the elements of his life which shaped him as a writer.

Like most of his books and short stories, Dahl’s book about his own life is entertaining and enjoyable. Boy: Tales Of Childhood begins with a short history about the author’s grandfather and father. The book details his father’s life, how his father lost his hand, how he ran off with his brother to make a fortune in a foreign land, his success, his marriages and his death.

Dahl recalls how his mother’s strong will and determination to fulfill his father’s dream of educating his children in England was the reason the young widow with 5 children, refused to go back to Norway. Dahl shares some fond memories of his childhood, his life as a child at home in England, and with his family in Norway.

Then comes Dahl’s experiences in English schools. At the age of 9, Dahl was put in a boarding school. The school life he has described is mostly unpleasant. Punishments and canings, and sadistic matrons and masters made life horrible for the kids. The pranks he played are humorous to read, and the punishments he got sound equally unpleasant.

The book ends with Roald Dahl’s first job at the Royal Dutch Shell. Through this autobiographical book, Dahl gives us a look at his own personal life, as well as the lives of the English people of his time, the living conditions, the education system, and their drawbacks. This edition has an attractive new cover and illustrations by Quentin Blake. There are black and white photos, and extracts of letters in Dahl’s own handwriting.

Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever traces how Greg Heffley just cannot catch a break. With Christmas looming, the pressure to be on his best behaviour and get into Santa’s good books is just too high. The book continues to chart the hilarious situations that Greg gets into despite his best attempts to avoid them. In portraying Greg’s antics, it keeps alive the innocence and mischief of the protagonist.

An addiction to the online game, Net Kritterz, and Greg's desire to keep his virtual online pet alive, spark a series of events that could turn Greg either into a hero or a villain. These events could land Greg into trouble with the authorities, although he is not sure if that is worse than being snowed in with his family. Get rich schemes that backfire, a sibling rivalry that keeps going up a notch, a secret so dark it could destroy him, and Greg is in the midst of it all.

Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever deals with every child's anxiety over the holiday season. The classic conflict of being a good child versus a child's innate desire to follow natural instincts is well portrayed by Kinney and will have readers reminiscing their childhood.

Published in 2011, Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever by Jeff Kinney is amongst the fastest selling books of 2011 and Amulet Books stated that the book was one of their most significant titles of the year.

This book garnered rave reviews amongst critics and was nominated for a 2012 Harvey Award for Special Award for Humor in Comics. Publishers Weekly lauded the book and Kinney’s writing. Jeff Kinney won the Best Author Children's Choice Award from the Children's Book Council in 2012 for this book.

When the learned Brahmin, Vishnugupta, is humiliated by the arrogant king, Dhana Nanda, in a public gathering, he swears revenge. Anger is his weakness, but strategy, his strength. This formerly unknown Brahmin goes on to become the most well-known kingmaker in Indian history: Chanakya. Using a combination of cunning, ruthlessness and luck, Chanakya fulfils his vow and propels a boy of unknown origins, Chandragupta Maurya, to the throne of the most powerful kingdom of that time, an empire even Alexander the Great hesitated to confront.

This fascinating account shows how Chanakya went from being a penniless fugitive with the rebel prince of Pataliputra to the prime minister of Magadha, and finally the author of the groundbreaking Arthashastra. With fun snippets and lesser-known facts about Chanakya and the Mauryan age, this book promises to be an exciting and gripping adventure story.

Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Ugly Truth picks up two weeks after Greg and Rowley stopped being friends. They are not even talking to each other and Rowley Jefferson’s parents have found a replacement best friend for him. They have got him a for-hire friend, called Cool Brian, designed to be a role model for a kid Rowley’s age.

Greg, meanwhile, has decided that he has had about enough of being a kid. He wants to grow up as soon as possible and leave his childhood behind. Unexpectedly, he gets an opportunity to show his grown up side.

Greg’s mother, Susan Heffley, has decided to return to college for a few months and asks her family to take good care of each other and their home, when she is away. Now, Greg is left responsible for waking himself up every morning on time, find clean clothes to wear when there are none, and deal with his home work on his own.

While he is dealing with all this, his Uncle Gary is preparing for his fourth marriage. As a class assignment, he has to take care of an egg. He also has to deal with a lazy maid at home who shirks most of her work and takes naps on Greg’s bed. Things just proceed from bad to worse, with Greg’s dad spraining his ankle, and a supervised slumber party turning into a disaster. Also, Greg finds that his dentist appointment is not at the center that he likes, but with a paranoid and irritable dentist.

Meet Percy Jackson. He is twelve years old, and he decides to tell us the story of his past year. On the first day of summer, just after his sixth-grade year, Percy discovers that something is wrong with him. Or rather, something is right with him. He learns that he is a half-blood: half-human, half-god. He is taken to Camp Half-Blood in New York, a camp for kids just like him that is safe from monsters that like to attack half-bloods. 

At camp, Percy learns more information about himself: his father is Poseidon, god of the Sea and brother to Zeus and Hades. When Zeus's master bolt (the thing that allows him to create lightning whenever he wants) is stolen, Poseidon is blamed for the theft. Zeus tells Poseidon that the master bolt must be returned to Mount Olympus by the summer solstice, or else he will declare war on Poseidon. Poseidon is miffed that his brother Zeus would even accuse him of such a thing.

Percy sets out on a quest to retrieve Zeus's master bolt, which is believed to be in Hades's captivity in the Underworld. Helping Percy are Grover, his BFF, and Annabeth, a smart demi-goddess and daughter of Athena. The three take a bus, a train, a truck, and a taxi cab to make their way across America, from New York to Los Angeles, where the gates of the Underworld are located. They stop in St. Louis, Denver, and Las Vegas along the way. During their quest, they battle vicious monsters like Medusa, they find disaster on the observation deck of the Gateway Arch, they are tricked by the god of war (Ares), they nearly lose their memories in an enchanted Vegas casino, and they are almost stretched to death.

Once in the Underworld, Percy finds that Hades does not have Zeus's master bolt, and he is missing his own symbol of power: the helm of darkness. Hades accuses Percy of stealing both the master bolt and the helm of darkness for his father, Poseidon. He accuses Poseidon of being power-hungry. To make things worse, the master bolt magically appears in Percy's backpack while he is talking to Hades. 

After escaping Hades's wrath, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover encounter Ares, the god of war, on the Santa Monica beach. Percy questions Ares and discovers that Ares stole the master bolt and helm of darkness from the original thief (whose name we don't yet know). Ares has been tempted by the possibility of sparking one of the biggest wars of all time between the Big Three: Hades, Zeus, and Poseidon. Percy and Ares battle it out on the beach, and Percy wounds Ares, winning the helm of darkness. Ares curses Percy. 

Percy returns the helm of darkness to Hades and takes a plane to New York City where he finds Mount Olympus on the 600th floor of the Empire State Building. Percy meets Poseidon and Zeus for the first time and tells them everything that he knows and suspects. He tells them that he believes Kronos, king of the Titans who ruled in the age before the Greek gods, is getting ready to wage war on the Olympians (the Greek gods and goddesses). Percy has been having dreams about Kronos in which Kronos talks to him. Zeus doesn't want to hear it. Poseidon tells Percy that he is proud of him and that he must make a choice when he goes home to his mom's apartment in Queens, NY.

That summer at Camp Half-Blood, Percy has a great time living the life of a hero. He procrastinates making a decision about whether he will stay at Camp Half-Blood year round, or whether he will go home and live with his mom in Queens. 

On the last day of camp, Percy is lured into the woods by his friend, Luke. Luke confesses to Percy that he was the original thief of the master bolt and the helm of darkness. He tells Percy that he serves Kronos and that Kronos is planning to defeat the Olympians and get rid of them. Luke vanishes, leaving a deadly scorpion to sting Percy. Percy nearly dies from this scorpion bite, but is rescued by wood nymphs who take him to safety. Percy's teacher, Chiron, nurses him back to health.

An Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments with Truth by Mohandas K. Gandhi traces Gandhi's life from his birth in Porbandar until the end of 1920, after his policy of non-cooperation with government is passed by the All-India Congress Committee. Gandhi says that at this point, his life has become so public that there is no need for him to write about it. The book is basically about how Gandhi arrives at the principles he holds and how they come about from his search for and belief in truth.

The story begins with Gandhi's childhood in the Porbandar and Rajkot. He is educated in the local schools until he finishes high school. While still in high school at the age of 13, in an arranged marriage, Gandhi marries a woman named Kasturbai, who stands by him his whole life. He is excited about the marriage at the time but both Gandhi and Kasturbai are against early marriages for their children. His father dies when he is sixteen and still in school. Gandhi finishes high school and goes on to study at Samaldas College, a local college located in Bhavnagar. He stays for just one semester and then decides to go to England where he can become a barrister in three years. Gandhi's mother is against the idea and to get her approval, Gandhi has to take a vow to not touch wine, women or meat while away. Gandhi reads for his exams, passes them, enrolls in the High Court and returns to India.

Gandhi is unsure of himself practicing law in India. He tries to intervene with an acquaintance, now the Political Agent in England, on behalf of his brother and they have sharp words. Gandhi's career is in jeopardy since appeals go to the Political Agent. Gandhi accepts an offer from a law firm in South Africa to help them with a case and after spending one year there he decides to stay there to help the Indian community. He works in South Africa until just two weeks prior to the outbreak of WWI in 1914. Back in India, he continues his public work, having already made a name for himself from his work in South Africa with Satyagraha, or civil disobedience and resistance by non-violent methods.

Gandhi's book accurately reflects the general goal and intent of his life - the search for truth and his firm belief in that truth. He believes that truth is God and all his experiments concern his attempts to achieve truth and purity. His experiments with dietetics are a life-long deal, and he seeks to find the perfect diet - one that wipes out lust and allows man to control his mind and thoughts. Within this framework he develops his principles for government reform. This consists of agitation through the use of civil disobedience and resistance without resorting to violence. One cannot practice civil disobedience without knowing and respecting the laws of the land since one must chose which laws to disobey and when. The uneducated can't do this, which is why the national day of hartal resulted in violence. The population hadn't been taught the principles of civil disobedience. Gandhi ends his book in 1920 during the period of agitation and non-cooperation. The events of his life are well-known after that point. (bookrags.com)",My Experiments with Truth,M. K.

In a small Buckinghamshire village, Matilda Wormwood is a five-and-half-year-old girl of unusual precocity, but her parents treat her with disdain. She resorts to pranks such as gluing her father's hat to his head, hiding a friend's parrot in the chimney to simulate a burglar or ghost, and secretly bleaching her father's hair, to get revenge on her parents for being so mean to her. Matilda has read a variety of books by different authors, especially at the age of four, when she read many in six months.

At school, Matilda befriends her teacher, Jennifer Honey, who is astonished by Matilda's intellectual abilities. She tries to move her into a higher class but is refused by the headmistress, the tyrannical Miss Agatha Trunchbull. Miss Honey also tries to talk to Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood about Matilda's intelligence, but they ignore her.

Matilda quickly develops a particularly strong bond with Miss Honey and watches as Miss Trunchbull terrorizes her students with creative, over-the-top punishments. When Matilda's friend, Lavender, plays a practical joke on Miss Trunchbull by placing a newt in her jug of water, Matilda uses an unexpected power of telekinesis to tip the glass of water containing the newt onto Miss Trunchbull.

After Matilda reveals her powers to Miss Honey, Miss Honey confides that she was raised by an abusive aunt after the suspicious death of her father. Her aunt is revealed to be Miss Trunchbull, who appears (among other misdeeds) to be withholding her niece's inheritance so that Miss Honey has to live in poverty in a derelict farm cottage. Preparing to avenge Miss Honey, Matilda develops her telekinetic gift through practice at home. Later, during a lesson that Miss Trunchbull is teaching, Matilda telekinetically raises a piece of chalk to the blackboard and writes on it, posing as the spirit of Miss Honey's late father and demanding that Miss Trunchbull hand over Miss Honey's house and wages and leave the region forever.

This is soon done, and a short while later the school's deputy head teacher, Mr. Trilby, visits Miss Trunchbull's house but finds it empty with no sign of her next destination. As Mr. Trilby becomes the new head of the school, he proves himself to be capable and good-natured, with the result that Matilda herself advances to the highest level of schooling. Rather to her relief, she is no longer capable of telekinesis; this is explained by Miss Honey as the result of using her mind on a more challenging curriculum. Matilda continues to visit Miss Honey at her house regularly, but one day finds her parents and her older brother Michael hastily packing to escape from the police, who are after her father for selling stolen cars. Matilda asks permission to live with Miss Honey, to which her parents rather uninterestedly agree. So both she and Miss Honey find their happy ending, and the school's atmosphere and curriculum have overwhelmingly improved under Mr. Trilby.

Heroes Of Olympus: The Son Of Neptune takes the story forward from where the previous novel in the series The Lost Hero ended. As Percy Jackson wakes up from his long sleep, he is confused and does not remember much from his past. The only thing he remembers is his name and a person from his past with the name Annabeth.

As the son of Poseidon, Percy Jackson wakes up to the reality of his life that is a chaotic world of monsters, gods, and demigods. He realizes that he is followed by two snake-haired women who are hard to get rid of. He travels to the camp for the half-bloods which confuses him as he does not understand his purpose yet.

He meets the wolf Lupa who informs him about his true identity, that of a demigod and teaches him how to use his pocket sword to fight. Still, Percy’s mind does not give him any clear clues about his past and the vision is still blurred. The only thing the reader is sure about is that the quest followed by Percy and other demigods Hazel and Frank – the one that began in the previous books of the series – is still on. The search for the Prophesy of Seven has to be accomplished at any cost. They cannot fail in their mission or else many lives and the world might be on the verge of complete destruction.

Heroes Of Olympus: The Son Of Neptune begins with another camp for half-bloods and takes the reader to the land that is much beyond that of the gods. It brings into action new creatures including demigods and frightening monsters who have a role to play in the Prophesy of Seven. And thus, like its previous volumes, even this one is fascinating enough to keep the reader hooked till the last page. Heroes Of Olympus: The Son Of Neptune was well received, and it was listed on the bestsellers list of USA Today, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal. It has sold more than three million copies.

Rick Riordan’s The Last Olympian is the fifth and final installment of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. Published in 2009, this fantasy children’s book was a #1 bestseller on the lists of USA Today, the LA Times, and the Wall Street Journal. The novel follows the teenage demigod Percy Jackson, son of Poseidon and of a mortal woman. He and other demigods spend their summers at Camp Half-Blood, located in Long Island, NY.

When the novel opens, two sets of Greek gods are at war: the original race of gods, the Titans, versus the Olympians, their descendants. The demigods fight on the side of the Olympians, whose home, Mount Olympus, is located on the 600th floor of the Empire State Building in Manhattan, NY.

In the first scene of the novel, Percy and his fellow demigod Charles Beckendorf infiltrate Kronos’s ship. The latter is the Titan god of time, and he is leading the fight against the Olympians. Kronos has overtaken the body of Luke Castellan, a demigod who has bathed in the River Styx to become invulnerable. Although Percy and Charles succeed in blowing up the ship, Charles dies before he escapes.

Percy returns to Camp Half-Blood, where he encounters his mentor Chiron (a centaur) and love interest Annabeth Chase (daughter of Athena). The Oracle of Delphi, in the form of a mummified doll, reveals the Great Prophecy—the hero will make a choice to ensure the ultimate success or destruction of Olympus, a choice which will ensure the hero’s demise. Although it appears as though Percy is the hero mentioned in the prophecy, the author later reveals that it is Luke.

Once deciding to accept the Prophecy, Percy goes on a journey with Nico di Angelo, son of Hades, to learn more about Luke’s background in order to better be able to defeat him. They visit May Castellan, Luke’s mother, who has lost touch with reality. She is a mortal but has the gift of prophecy and tried to take on the role of the new Oracle of Delphi but was cursed.

Percy and Nico next journey to Central Park, which offers a passage to the Underworld. While there, they meet up with Grover Underwood, a satyr and Percy’s best friend. Grover becomes instrumental in helping lead the war efforts. Percy and Nico descend into the Underworld, and Percy bathes in the River Styx, rendering him invulnerable save for a patch on his lower back.

Next, Percy meets his fellow demigods at the Empire State Building. Their main objective is to keep the Titans away from Mount Olympus. They devise a plan to block off all of the entrances to Manhattan, and the various teams disperse. Percy and Annabeth stick together.

The demigods fight several battles against various monsters, such as the Clazmonian Sow, the Lydian pig, and the drakon. They force Kronos’s army back, but the fight wages on. During the battle, Rachel Dare, a mortal with the gift of sight, arrives to tell Percy that he is not the hero in the Prophecy. Rachel is another one of Percy’s love interests.

Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and Thalia finally go to Mount Olympus in a last-ditch effort to defend it. The city is crumbling around them, and Kronos has entered the throne room. Percy fights him, and Annabeth speaks to Luke, whose spirit is still present in Kronos. Annabeth and Luke have a history together, and she is able to get him to turn against Kronos and defeat him. Luke uses his own sword to kill Kronos, effectively killing himself. In this way, Luke fulfills the Prophecy.

Everyone returns to Camp Half-Blood to tend to the wounded and give burials to the dead. Rachel becomes the new Oracle of Delphi and tells Percy that they cannot be together. Percy confesses his feelings to Annabeth, and they two become a couple. The book ends as summer draws to a close, and the various demigods leave to go back to school in the normal world.

Pride and Prejudice is set in rural England in the early 19th century, and it follows the Bennet family, which includes five very different sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious to see all her daughters married, especially as the modest family estate is to be inherited by William Collins when Mr. Bennet dies. At a ball, the wealthy and newly arrived Charles Bingley takes an immediate interest in the eldest Bennet daughter, the beautiful and shy Jane. The encounter between his friend Darcy and Elizabeth is less cordial. Although Austen shows them intrigued by each other, she reverses the convention of first impressions: pride of rank and fortune and prejudice against the social inferiority of Elizabeth’s family hold Darcy aloof, while Elizabeth is equally fired both by the pride of self-respect and by prejudice against Darcy’s snobbery.
The pompous Collins subsequently arrives, hoping to marry one of the Bennet sisters. Elizabeth, however, refuses his offer of marriage, and he instead becomes engaged to her friend Charlotte Lucas. During this time, Elizabeth encounters the charming George Wickham, a military officer. There is a mutual attraction between the two, and he informs her that Darcy has denied him his inheritance.
After Bingley abruptly departs for London, Elizabeth’s dislike of Darcy increases as she becomes convinced that he is discouraging Bingley’s relationship with Jane. Darcy, however, has grown increasingly fond of Elizabeth, admiring her intelligence and vitality. While visiting the now-married Charlotte, Elizabeth sees Darcy, who professes his love for her and proposes. A surprised Elizabeth refuses his offer, and, when Darcy demands an explanation, she accuses him of breaking up Jane and Bingley. Darcy subsequently writes Elizabeth a letter in which he explains that he separated the couple largely because he did not believe Jane returned Bingley’s affection. He also discloses that Wickham, after squandering his inheritance, tried to marry Darcy’s then 15-year-old sister in an attempt to gain possession of her fortune. With these revelations, Elizabeth begins to see Darcy in a new light.
Shortly thereafter the youngest Bennet sister, Lydia, elopes with Wickham. The news is met with great alarm by Elizabeth, since the scandalous affair—which is unlikely to end in marriage—could ruin the reputation of the other Bennet sisters. When she tells Darcy, he persuades Wickham to marry Lydia, offering him money. Despite Darcy’s attempt to keep his intervention a secret, Elizabeth learns of his actions. At the encouragement of Darcy, Bingley subsequently returns, and he and Jane become engaged. Finally, Darcy proposes again to Elizabeth, who this time accepts.",Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen, , ,Puffin Books,9780141330167,"1st Edition,1995",439,India,English

Percy Jackson is pretty ordinary for a 12 year old. Besides the ADHD and dyslexia, he's normal. Or almost as normal as a son of Poseidon can be anyway. Expelled from almost every school he has ever been to, he has no reason to think Yancy Academy is any different. A school trip changes everything as his teacher, Mrs. Dodds, turns into one of the three Furies straight out of Greek legends and attacks him. After being saved by his Latin teacher, everyone forgets Mrs. Dodds, Percy learns that his closest friend is a Satyr and that he is the son of Poseidon, the Greek God. With barely any time to come to terms about his demigod status, Percy faces dangers and wonders from the old books, not being able to believe what he is experiencing. He has no time though, blamed for stealing Zeus's lightning bolt, he needs to clear his name before Zeus manages to find him. And to do that he needs to find the Lightning Thief.

Some years ago, when my own children were small, we usually kept a tortoise or two in the garden. In those days, a pet tortoise was a common sight crawling about on the family lawn or in the back yard. You could buy them quite cheaply in any pet-shop and they were probably the least troublesome of all childhood pets, and quite harmless.
Tortoises used to be brought into England by the thousand, packed in crates, and they came mostly from North Africa. But not many years ago a law was passed that made it illegal to bring any tortoises into the country. This was not done to protect us. The little tortoise was not a danger to anybody. It was done purely out of kindness to the tortoise itself. You see, the traders who brought them in used to cram hundreds of them tightly into the packing-crates without food or water and in such horrible conditions that a great many of them always died on the seajourney over. So rather than allow this cruelty to go on, the Government stopped the whole business.
The things you are going to read about in this story all happened in the days when anyone could go out and buy a nice little tortoise from a pet-shop.",Esio Trot (Last of Dahl's Books),Roald Dahl, , ,Puffin Books,9780141365480,"1st Edition,2016",71,India,English

The central figure of this book is the eccentric genius Professor Trilokeshwar Shonku, who is the son of physicist Tripureshwar Shonku. Along with Newton, his 24 year old pet cat, Prahlad, his loyal servant, and Bidhushekhar, his robot, Professor Shonku had left for the planet Mars in his rocket from Giridih. After their departure, they have not been traced.

A journal, found by a poor man, who later gives it to the editor of Sandesh reveals the various exploits of Professor Shonku and his companions in space. The editor learns how Professor Shonku’s plan of reaching Mars was laughed at by his neighbour, and how, upon reaching Mars, they were attacked by unfriendly Martians.

Professor Shonku and the others escape from Mars and are lost for some time wandering in space, until they reach the planet of Tafa, whose inhabitants are apparently the first civilized humans of the solar system. Unlike their welcome on Mars, Professor Shonku and the others are welcomed in Tafa very warmly and Professor Shonku is made a fellow citizen.

Several other journals picked up from his laboratory reveal stories about a mad Norwegian scientist, an angry sadhu, and a vengeful mummy.

Satyajit Ray’s use of lucid expressions to describe extraordinarily imaginative and humorous situation makes this book an extremely fascinating read.",The Diary of a Space Traveller and Other Stories,Satyajit Ray, , ,Puffin Books,9780143330905, ,288,India,English

About The Author
Rick Riordan is a teacher and a writer, and has won many awards for his mystery novels for adults. He says that the idea for Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief first came to him while he was teaching Greek mythology at middle school in San Francisco. But rumour has it that Camp Half Blood actually exists, and Rick spends his summers there recording the adventures of young demigods. Some believe that, to avoid a mass panic among the mortal population, he was forced to swear on the River Styx to present Percy Jackson's story as fiction. Rick lives in Texas (apart from his summers on Half Blood Hill) with his wife and two sons.",The Kane Chronicles: The Throne of Fire,Rick Riordan, , ,Puffin Books,9780141335674,"1st Published,2012",452,India,English

Published in 1984, Boy: Tales of Childhood, covers Dahl’s journey from his birth to the time he got his first job. Dahl recounts his days as a child. He includes stories of his early childhood, his family, his schooling, and goes up to his first job. While sharing these experiences, he also gives us a peek into the elements of his life which shaped him as a writer.

Like most of his books and short stories, Dahl’s book about his own life is entertaining and enjoyable. Boy: Tales Of Childhood begins with a short history about the author’s grandfather and father. The book details his father’s life, how his father lost his hand, how he ran off with his brother to make a fortune in a foreign land, his success, his marriages and his death.

Dahl recalls how his mother’s strong will and determination to fulfill his father’s dream of educating his children in England was the reason the young widow with 5 children, refused to go back to Norway. Dahl shares some fond memories of his childhood, his life as a child at home in England, and with his family in Norway.

Then comes Dahl’s experiences in English schools. At the age of 9, Dahl was put in a boarding school. The school life he has described is mostly unpleasant. Punishments and canings, and sadistic matrons and masters made life horrible for the kids. The pranks he played are humorous to read, and the punishments he got sound equally unpleasant.

The book ends with Roald Dahl’s first job at the Royal Dutch Shell. Through this autobiographical book, Dahl gives us a look at his own personal life, as well as the lives of the English people of his time, the living conditions, the education system, and their drawbacks. This edition has an attractive new cover and illustrations by Quentin Blake. There are black and white photos, and extracts of letters in Dahl’s own handwriting.
