Twilight is the first book in a multi-volume series aimed at young adult readers that has inspired such loyalty and excitement among its readers that some are comparing it to the Harry Potter phenomenon. Like J. K. Rowling's series, Twilight focuses on a young person who really does not have a functioning family.  Like Harry, Bella Swan learns that there is more to the world than she thought. But where Harry Potter encountered the reality of magic, young Bella must face the fact that vampires are real. And, while Harry quickly falls in love with magic and the world of magic he explores, Bella falls in love in a far more literal sense: she falls for Edward Cullen, one of the beautiful, ethical vampires living in her new home of Forks, Washington.

This leads her into intense danger, first from Edward, who must master his intense desire to drink her blood if she is to live, and then from other vampires who are not as ethical or civilized as Edward and his loving adoptive family. The result is a striking blend: one part young adult novel about high school romance, two parts intense and often erotic desire between a young girl and a hundred-year-old vampire, and a final portion a rollercoaster of a thriller as another vampire tries to kill Bella. Written in clear prose and with a markedly ethical tone, Twilight has appealed to so many readers that it made it onto the New York Times bestseller list. Twilight was made into a movie starring Kristen Stewart as Bella in December 2008.",Twilight,Stephenie Meyer, , ,Atom Books,9781904233657,"Edition,2007",434,India,English

New Moon picks up from where Twilight ended. Bella is seen enjoying her eighteenth birthday in the company of Edward and his vampire family. Bella accidently gets a paper cut while unwrapping a gift, which turns things violent as the scent of her blood overwhelms Edward’s brother Jasper, who then attempts to kill her. In order to protect Bella, Edward leaves town with the rest of his family. His sudden departure leaves Bella heartbroken. In a constant state of depression, she turns to her friend Jacob Black for comfort and solace. Meanwhile, Jacob is also hiding an enormous secret of his own, which if Bella happens to discover, would make things even more complicated.

Edward is just as miserable as Bella and is longing to come back to her. But he fears it might get a little too late and he will be left broken-hearted all over again. Eventually, Bella and Edward’s relationship takes a dark turn which is represented by the celestial darkness during a new moon. Will Bella and Edward be able to forget the past and start all over again? New Moon has been translated into 38 languages and has sold millions of copies all around the world. A film adaptation of New Moon was released on November 20, 2009.
