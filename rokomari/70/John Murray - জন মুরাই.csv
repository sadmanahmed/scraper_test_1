From the visionary head of Google's innovative People Operations comes a groundbreaking inquiry into the philosophy of work-and a blueprint for attracting the most spectacular talent to your business and ensuring that they succeed.

""We spend more time working than doing anything else in life. It's not right that the experience of work should be so demotivating and dehumanizing."" So says Laszlo Bock, head of People Operations at the company that transformed how the world interacts with knowledge.

This insight is the heart of WORK RULES!, a compelling and surprisingly playful manifesto that offers lessons including: Give your work meaning. Trust your people. Hire only people who are better than you. Don’t confuse development with managing performance. Focus on the two tails. Be frugal and generous. Pay unfairly. Nudge. Manage the rising expectations. Enjoy! And then go back to No. 1 and start again.",Work Rules: Insights from Inside Google That Will Transform How You Live and lead,Laszlo Bock, , ,John Murray,9781444792386,"1st Edition,2016",406,India,English

Written by two of the most important personalities of Google, this title gives the reader a clear view of the workspace of the world's biggest software giant. Today, Google has become synonymous with the world of the internet. But, it did not begin as a walk in the park. Hence, Eric and Jonathan write about the amazing evolution Google has experienced since its inception as a small start-up. The book talks about the monumental change Google has brought in work culture, business strategy, user friendliness, consumer approach, everyday innovation, and most importantly, how the gravity of its business interest shifted from the company to consumers. As the authors have  first person perspectives on Google's unprecedented growth, they give a very clear picture to any organization that aspires to make the most of the current technologies. How Google Works recounts the story of a generation that has seen the internet and mobile technology taking over everything that existed before in the technological realm.
