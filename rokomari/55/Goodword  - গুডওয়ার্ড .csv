The decisive encounters between the East and West-- Islam and Christendom--in the fields of war or peace had the most far reaching effects on their destinies. This is one of the most important subjects of Islamic history, indeed perhaps the most important of all. Besides its abundant and eventful episodes, it throws much light on this eternal struggle between the East and the West. As many of these events are scantily dealt with by the Islamic chroniclers, careful reference to Western sources and scholars has been made to analyses the subject in detail.

This important book highlights major 'turning points' that lead to the next stage of Islamic civilization. The Mongols destruction of Baghdad, Tariq bin Ziyad's landing in Spain, the Crusades and so forth are just some of the events that are featured.

As the book explains in detail, findings from the last two decades in particular openly contradict the basic assumptions of the evolutionary theory.

The Quran is really a miracle book. It has been perused by pious scholars ever since it was revealed and, assuredly, seekers after truth will continue to ponder over it until the Day of Resurrection.
Scholars of the Quran from the earliest times have considered it very important to study the meaning and message of Quranic wording. Some have dedicated themselves to arranging the text, while others have explained it in their commentaries. They have also worked very diligently to explain its more difficult words and expressions by having recourse to classical Arabic poetry, sayings and proverbs.
The most famous of the exegetists was Abdullah ibn Abbas, who was deservedly called “Tarjuman al-Qur'an' (The interpreter of the Qur'an). Many others followed him and mufradat al-Qur'an, that is, Quranic lexicography, became a branch of the Qur’anic sciences. Countless books have been written on the subject. The most famous of these are the works of Imam Raghib and Imam Razi.
In today’s hectic and busy world, it has become essential to prepare a dictionary of Qur’anic phraseology which will thoroughly satisfy the queries of readers who would like to know and understand the Qur'an better, without having to sacrifice their mundane interests-a dictionary that would be neither too lengthy nor too short.
Good word Books felt this need and requested me to prepare such a dictionary. I have, therefore, prepared this handy glossary, hoping that work, I have consulted as many as ten English translations of the...",A Glossary of the Quran,Aurang Zeb Azmi, , ,Goodword,9788178981598,"Reprint,2010",258,India,English

THE QURAN, a book which brings glad tidings to mankind along with divine admonition, stresses the importance of man's discovery of truth on both spiritual and intellectual planes
Every book has its objective and the objective of the Quran is to make man aware of the Creation plan of God. That is, to tell man why God created this world; what the purpose is of settling man on earth; what is required from man in his pre-death life span, and what he is going to confront after death. The purpose of the Quran is to make man aware of this reality, thus serving to guide man on his entire journey through life into the after-life.
The main themes of the Quran are enlightenment, closeness to God, peace and spirituality. The Quran uses several terms, tawassum, tadabbur, and tafakkur, which indicate the learning of lessons through reflection, thinking and contemplation on the signs of God scattered across the world. The present translation of the Quran has been done keeping in mind these very themes.",The Quran, ,"Maulana Wahiduddin Khan,Prof. Farida Khanam", ,Goodword,9788178986531,"Bilingual edition,2018",512,India,English

One always tends to associate the concept of eternity with figures such as a thousand years, one million or a billion years. Such a concept of time seems to suggest an everlasting period. Similarly, what the concept of ""infinite distance"" evokes in the mind is great distances, like a hundred thousand or a million light years.
Nevertheless, even if you endeavor to think of the greatest figure possible, you are still limited by the intellectual capacity of your mind. An example would contribute to a fuller understanding of the extraordinary extent of eternity: if a quadrillion of people spent all their lives, lasting also a quadrillion years, doing nothing but counting numbers, day and night without stopping, they would still fail to arrive at eternity, since eternity as a concept has no beginning and no end.
In the Sight of Allah, the Almighty, this concept of the ""everlasting"" and accordingly absolutely incomputable, has already ended. Eternity, which appears to be an unattainable concept for us, is actually just a single moment in the Sight of Allah.
This book presents to you unprecedented explanations of timelessness, spacelessness and eternity, and makes you confront an important fact: that eternity has already begun. The realization of this fact will make you once again appreciate Allah, the Almighty and Exalted, and His Creation. Meanwhile, you will find comprehensible answers to some frequently asked questions: Where is Allah? What is the resurrection? What is the true nature of death? Is there an endless life? And when will all these happen?
Yet, before proceeding with these issues, some concepts like ""the real nature of matter"" and ""timelessness,"" will be dealt with in detail for a better comprehension of the above—mentioned subject.",Eternity Has Already Begun (Color),Harun Yahya, , ,Goodword,9788178980157,"1st Edition,2009",128,India,English

The decisive encounters between the East and West-- Islam and Christendom--in the fields of war or peace had the most far reaching effects on their destinies. This is one of the most important subjects of Islamic history, indeed perhaps the most important of all. Besides its abundant and eventful episodes, it throws much light on this eternal struggle between the East and the West. As many of these events are scantily dealt with by the Islamic chroniclers, careful reference to Western sources and scholars has been made to analyses the subject in detail.

This important book highlights major 'turning points' that lead to the next stage of Islamic civilization. The Mongols destruction of Baghdad, Tariq bin Ziyad's landing in Spain, the Crusades and so forth are just some of the events that are featured.

This book is the most comprehensive scientific challenge from Harun Yahya to Darwinism. As the book explains in detail, findings from the last two decades in particular openly contradict the basic assumptions of the evolutionary theory. Many branches of science, such as paleontology, biochemistry, population genetics, comparative anatomy and biophysics, indicate that natural processes and coincidental effects cannot explain life, as the theory of evolution proposes.",Darwinism Refuted (How the Theory of Evolution Breaks Down in the Light of Modern Science),Harun Yahya, , ,Goodword,9788178981345,"Reprinted,2007",376,India,English

The Quran is really a miracle book. It has been perused by pious scholars ever since it was revealed and, assuredly, seekers after truth will continue to ponder over it until the Day of Resurrection.
Scholars of the Quran from the earliest times have considered it very important to study the meaning and message of Quranic wording. Some have dedicated themselves to arranging the text, while others have explained it in their commentaries. They have also worked very diligently to explain its more difficult words and expressions by having recourse to classical Arabic poetry, sayings and proverbs.
The most famous of the exegetists was Abdullah ibn Abbas, who was deservedly called “Tarjuman al-Qur'an' (The interpreter of the Qur'an). Many others followed him and mufradat al-Qur'an, that is, Quranic lexicography, became a branch of the Qur’anic sciences. Countless books have been written on the subject. The most famous of these are the works of Imam Raghib and Imam Razi.
In today’s hectic and busy world, it has become essential to prepare a dictionary of Qur’anic phraseology which will thoroughly satisfy the queries of readers who would like to know and understand the Qur'an better, without having to sacrifice their mundane interests-a dictionary that would be neither too lengthy nor too short.
Good word Books felt this need and requested me to prepare such a dictionary. I have, therefore, prepared this handy glossary, hoping that work, I have consulted as many as ten English translations of the...",A Glossary of the Quran,Aurang Zeb Azmi, , ,Goodword,9788178981598,"Reprint,2010",258,India,English

THE QURAN, a book which brings glad tidings to mankind along with divine admonition, stresses the importance of man's discovery of truth on both spiritual and intellectual planes
Every book has its objective and the objective of the Quran is to make man aware of the Creation plan of God. That is, to tell man why God created this world; what the purpose is of settling man on earth; what is required from man in his pre-death life span, and what he is going to confront after death. The purpose of the Quran is to make man aware of this reality, thus serving to guide man on his entire journey through life into the after-life.
The main themes of the Quran are enlightenment, closeness to God, peace and spirituality. The Quran uses several terms, tawassum, tadabbur, and tafakkur, which indicate the learning of lessons through reflection, thinking and contemplation on the signs of God scattered across the world. The present translation of the Quran has been done keeping in mind these very themes.",The Quran, ,"Maulana Wahiduddin Khan,Prof. Farida Khanam", ,Goodword,9788178986531,"Bilingual edition,2018",512,India,English

One always tends to associate the concept of eternity with figures such as a thousand years, one million or a billion years. Such a concept of time seems to suggest an everlasting period. Similarly, what the concept of ""infinite distance"" evokes in the mind is great distances, like a hundred thousand or a million light years.
Nevertheless, even if you endeavor to think of the greatest figure possible, you are still limited by the intellectual capacity of your mind. An example would contribute to a fuller understanding of the extraordinary extent of eternity: if a quadrillion of people spent all their lives, lasting also a quadrillion years, doing nothing but counting numbers, day and night without stopping, they would still fail to arrive at eternity, since eternity as a concept has no beginning and no end.
In the Sight of Allah, the Almighty, this concept of the ""everlasting"" and accordingly absolutely incomputable, has already ended. Eternity, which appears to be an unattainable concept for us, is actually just a single moment in the Sight of Allah.
This book presents to you unprecedented explanations of timelessness, spacelessness and eternity, and makes you confront an important fact: that eternity has already begun. The realization of this fact will make you once again appreciate Allah, the Almighty and Exalted, and His Creation. Meanwhile, you will find comprehensible answers to some frequently asked questions: Where is Allah? What is the resurrection? What is the true nature of death? Is there an endless life? And when will all these happen?
Yet, before proceeding with these issues, some concepts like ""the real nature of matter"" and ""timelessness,"" will be dealt with in detail for a better comprehension of the above—mentioned subject.",Eternity Has Already Begun (Color),Harun Yahya, , ,Goodword,9788178980157,"1st Edition,2009",128,India,English

The decisive encounters between the East and West-- Islam and Christendom--in the fields of war or peace had the most far reaching effects on their destinies. This is one of the most important subjects of Islamic history, indeed perhaps the most important of all. Besides its abundant and eventful episodes, it throws much light on this eternal struggle between the East and the West. As many of these events are scantily dealt with by the Islamic chroniclers, careful reference to Western sources and scholars has been made to analyses the subject in detail.

This important book highlights major 'turning points' that lead to the next stage of Islamic civilization. The Mongols destruction of Baghdad, Tariq bin Ziyad's landing in Spain, the Crusades and so forth are just some of the events that are featured.

Many branches of science, such as paleontology, biochemistry, population genetics, comparative anatomy and biophysics, indicate that natural processes and coincidental effects cannot explain life, as the theory of evolution proposes.",Darwinism Refuted (How the Theory of Evolution Breaks Down in the Light of Modern Science),Harun Yahya, , ,Goodword,9788178981345,"Reprinted,2007",376,India,English

The Quran is really a miracle book. It has been perused by pious scholars ever since it was revealed and, assuredly, seekers after truth will continue to ponder over it until the Day of Resurrection.
Scholars of the Quran from the earliest times have considered it very important to study the meaning and message of Quranic wording. Some have dedicated themselves to arranging the text, while others have explained it in their commentaries. They have also worked very diligently to explain its more difficult words and expressions by having recourse to classical Arabic poetry, sayings and proverbs.
The most famous of the exegetists was Abdullah ibn Abbas, who was deservedly called “Tarjuman al-Qur'an' (The interpreter of the Qur'an). Many others followed him and mufradat al-Qur'an, that is, Quranic lexicography, became a branch of the Qur’anic sciences. Countless books have been written on the subject. The most famous of these are the works of Imam Raghib and Imam Razi.
In today’s hectic and busy world, it has become essential to prepare a dictionary of Qur’anic phraseology which will thoroughly satisfy the queries of readers who would like to know and understand the Qur'an better, without having to sacrifice their mundane interests-a dictionary that would be neither too lengthy nor too short.
Good word Books felt this need and requested me to prepare such a dictionary. I have, therefore, prepared this handy glossary, hoping that work, I have consulted as many as ten English translations of the...",A Glossary of the Quran,Aurang Zeb Azmi, , ,Goodword,9788178981598,"Reprint,2010",258,India,English

THE QURAN, a book which brings glad tidings to mankind along with divine admonition, stresses the importance of man's discovery of truth on both spiritual and intellectual planes
Every book has its objective and the objective of the Quran is to make man aware of the Creation plan of God. That is, to tell man why God created this world; what the purpose is of settling man on earth; what is required from man in his pre-death life span, and what he is going to confront after death. The purpose of the Quran is to make man aware of this reality, thus serving to guide man on his entire journey through life into the after-life.
The main themes of the Quran are enlightenment, closeness to God, peace and spirituality. The Quran uses several terms, tawassum, tadabbur, and tafakkur, which indicate the learning of lessons through reflection, thinking and contemplation on the signs of God scattered across the world. The present translation of the Quran has been done keeping in mind these very themes.",The Quran, ,"Maulana Wahiduddin Khan,Prof. Farida Khanam", ,Goodword,9788178986531,"Bilingual edition,2018",512,India,English

One always tends to associate the concept of eternity with figures such as a thousand years, one million or a billion years. Such a concept of time seems to suggest an everlasting period. Similarly, what the concept of ""infinite distance"" evokes in the mind is great distances, like a hundred thousand or a million light years.
Nevertheless, even if you endeavor to think of the greatest figure possible, you are still limited by the intellectual capacity of your mind. An example would contribute to a fuller understanding of the extraordinary extent of eternity: if a quadrillion of people spent all their lives, lasting also a quadrillion years, doing nothing but counting numbers, day and night without stopping, they would still fail to arrive at eternity, since eternity as a concept has no beginning and no end.
In the Sight of Allah, the Almighty, this concept of the ""everlasting"" and accordingly absolutely incomputable, has already ended. Eternity, which appears to be an unattainable concept for us, is actually just a single moment in the Sight of Allah.
This book presents to you unprecedented explanations of timelessness, spacelessness and eternity, and makes you confront an important fact: that eternity has already begun. The realization of this fact will make you once again appreciate Allah, the Almighty and Exalted, and His Creation. Meanwhile, you will find comprehensible answers to some frequently asked questions: Where is Allah? What is the resurrection? What is the true nature of death? Is there an endless life? And when will all these happen?
Yet, before proceeding with these issues, some concepts like ""the real nature of matter"" and ""timelessness,"" will be dealt with in detail for a better comprehension of the above—mentioned subject.",Eternity Has Already Begun (Color),Harun Yahya, , ,Goodword,9788178980157,"1st Edition,2009",128,India,English

The decisive encounters between the East and West-- Islam and Christendom--in the fields of war or peace had the most far reaching effects on their destinies. This is one of the most important subjects of Islamic history, indeed perhaps the most important of all. Besides its abundant and eventful episodes, it throws much light on this eternal struggle between the East and the West. As many of these events are scantily dealt with by the Islamic chroniclers, careful reference to Western sources and scholars has been made to analyses the subject in detail.

This important book highlights major 'turning points' that lead to the next stage of Islamic civilization. The Mongols destruction of Baghdad, Tariq bin Ziyad's landing in Spain, the Crusades and so forth are just some of the events that are featured.

The Quran is really a miracle book. It has been perused by pious scholars ever since it was revealed and, assuredly, seekers after truth will continue to ponder over it until the Day of Resurrection.
Scholars of the Quran from the earliest times have considered it very important to study the meaning and message of Quranic wording. Some have dedicated themselves to arranging the text, while others have explained it in their commentaries. They have also worked very diligently to explain its more difficult words and expressions by having recourse to classical Arabic poetry, sayings and proverbs.
The most famous of the exegetists was Abdullah ibn Abbas, who was deservedly called “Tarjuman al-Qur'an' (The interpreter of the Qur'an). Many others followed him and mufradat al-Qur'an, that is, Quranic lexicography, became a branch of the Qur’anic sciences. Countless books have been written on the subject. The most famous of these are the works of Imam Raghib and Imam Razi.
In today’s hectic and busy world, it has become essential to prepare a dictionary of Qur’anic phraseology which will thoroughly satisfy the queries of readers who would like to know and understand the Qur'an better, without having to sacrifice their mundane interests-a dictionary that would be neither too lengthy nor too short.
Good word Books felt this need and requested me to prepare such a dictionary. I have, therefore, prepared this handy glossary, hoping that work, I have consulted as many as ten English translations of the...",A Glossary of the Quran,Aurang Zeb Azmi, , ,Goodword,9788178981598,"Reprint,2010",258,India,English

THE QURAN, a book which brings glad tidings to mankind along with divine admonition, stresses the importance of man's discovery of truth on both spiritual and intellectual planes
Every book has its objective and the objective of the Quran is to make man aware of the Creation plan of God. That is, to tell man why God created this world; what the purpose is of settling man on earth; what is required from man in his pre-death life span, and what he is going to confront after death. The purpose of the Quran is to make man aware of this reality, thus serving to guide man on his entire journey through life into the after-life.
The main themes of the Quran are enlightenment, closeness to God, peace and spirituality. The Quran uses several terms, tawassum, tadabbur, and tafakkur, which indicate the learning of lessons through reflection, thinking and contemplation on the signs of God scattered across the world. The present translation of the Quran has been done keeping in mind these very themes.",The Quran, ,"Maulana Wahiduddin Khan,Prof. Farida Khanam", ,Goodword,9788178986531,"Bilingual edition,2018",512,India,English

One always tends to associate the concept of eternity with figures such as a thousand years, one million or a billion years. Such a concept of time seems to suggest an everlasting period. Similarly, what the concept of ""infinite distance"" evokes in the mind is great distances, like a hundred thousand or a million light years.
Nevertheless, even if you endeavor to think of the greatest figure possible, you are still limited by the intellectual capacity of your mind. An example would contribute to a fuller understanding of the extraordinary extent of eternity: if a quadrillion of people spent all their lives, lasting also a quadrillion years, doing nothing but counting numbers, day and night without stopping, they would still fail to arrive at eternity, since eternity as a concept has no beginning and no end.
In the Sight of Allah, the Almighty, this concept of the ""everlasting"" and accordingly absolutely incomputable, has already ended. Eternity, which appears to be an unattainable concept for us, is actually just a single moment in the Sight of Allah.
This book presents to you unprecedented explanations of timelessness, spacelessness and eternity, and makes you confront an important fact: that eternity has already begun. The realization of this fact will make you once again appreciate Allah, the Almighty and Exalted, and His Creation. Meanwhile, you will find comprehensible answers to some frequently asked questions: Where is Allah? What is the resurrection? What is the true nature of death? Is there an endless life? And when will all these happen?
Yet, before proceeding with these issues, some concepts like ""the real nature of matter"" and ""timelessness,"" will be dealt with in detail for a better comprehension of the above—mentioned subject.",Eternity Has Already Begun (Color),Harun Yahya, , ,Goodword,9788178980157,"1st Edition,2009",128,India,English
