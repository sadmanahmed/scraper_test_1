Much has been written about Albert Einstein and about the Theory of Relativity. The man and his theory had an impact on every field. In Science and in Warfare, in Politics and in the development of Nuclear Weapons. Most importantly though, the equation changed the way science viewed the universe. It led to a deeper understanding of the evolution of the universe and the various celestial objects and how the whole universe works.

Little though, has been written about the equation itself, of its own fascinating story. Of how it evolved, how various scientists contributed to the evolution of this game changing theory, how Einstein arrived at each element of the equation ‘e’, ‘m’, ‘=’, ‘c’, ‘2’. In E=mc2: A Biography Of The World's Most Famous Equation, the author sets out to relate the interesting story of the equation itself. It is not a deep scientific exposition on the equation, but the story of the thinking behind the equation which makes it a fascinating read.

The author goes into the works of other scientists - like Faraday’s work with energy fields, Rutherford’s revelation of atomic structure, Enrico Fermi’s exploration of the nuclei and Roemer’s assertion that the speed of light was measurable. He also reveals the work of little known scientists like Cecilia Payne and Lise Meitner, who had to overcome many obstacles because of their gender, to achieve what they did. He traces the contribution these scientists to the ultimate evolution of the theory of relativity.

E=mc2: A Biography Of The World's Most Famous Equation explores some interesting pieces of history that are related to the equation, like the Manhattan Project and a little known German Nuclear Weapons project. The book also presents the momentous impact the little equation had on World history, its influence on Science, Engineering, War, Politics and its astonishing impact on helping scientists understand the origins of the Universe.
