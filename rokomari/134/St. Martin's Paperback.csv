IN ONE HEARTBEAT?THEIR LIVES CHANGED FOREVER?
When Cecily Deravenel tells her eighteen-year-old son Edward of the death of his father, brother, uncle, and cousin in a fire, a part of Edward dies as well.?Not only is he too young to shoulder the responsibility for an entire family, Edward is also suspicious of the deaths.

IN ONE MOMENT, AMBITION AND REVENGE ARE BORN.
As he grows into a handsome, charismatic man, Edward is torn between duty and desire. There are women in his life for whom he?ll risk everything?and one woman who might destroy him. But madness and secrecy lie at the heart of the family, and Edward?s enemies are far more ruthless than he knows. He will need his strength more than ever when?the?house of Deravenel is fatally rocked by betrayal from within.
