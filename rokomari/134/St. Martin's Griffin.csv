In 16-year-old Zoey Redbird's world, vampyres not only exist but are also tolerated by humans. Those whom the creatures mark? as special enter the House of Night school where they will either become vampyres themselves, or, if their body rejects the change, die. To Zoey, being marked is truly a blessing, though she's scared at first. She has never fit into the human world and has always felt she is destined for something else. Her grandmother, a descendant of the Cherokee, has always supported her emotionally, and it is she who takes the girl to her new school. But even there the teen stands apart from the others. Her mark from the Goddess Nyx is a special one, showing that her powers are very strong for one so young. At the House of Night, Zoey finds true friendship, loyalty, and romance as well as mistrust and deception. She realizes that all is not right in the vampyre world and that the problems she thought she left behind exist there as well. Readers will identify with many of the characters, especially the protagonist. The story moves quickly (a little too quickly at the end) and purposely leaves many unresolved issues. A good choice for those libraries serving fans of the occult, but be aware that the book contains some suggestive language and sex.?

""Zoey Redbird is a teenage diva in every respect well, almost. She doesn't get along with her mom and she hates her stepdad. That's normal. She adores her sweet grandmother. That's normal. What makes her different from the average teenage girl is that she is a vampire. In fact, two of her three boyfriends are vampires, her best friend is one of the ghoulish undead creatures that walk the streets at night preying on homeless people, and all of the students at the private boarding school she attends are fledgling vampires, including Zoey. Plus, Zoey is the president of the student body, if you consider being in charge of the Dark Daughters to be a leadership position. Filled with secrets, Zoey's life becomes harder and harder to handle as she tries to juggle what she has to do with what she is expected to do. Her main obstacle is the high priestess, who reigns over both the 'vampyre' community and the boarding school. In this third book of the 'House of Night' series, Zoey finds strength to challenge the priestess, who she believes is not what she appears to be. (But then, who is?) Paranormal chick-lit for vampire lovers!"" Gail C. Krause, Children's Literature

""Zoey Redbird is back in this third installment of the House of Night series, which begins a month after Zoey's showdown in the tunnels with Neferet and her army of dead vampyre fledglings. While Zoey's pals are still grieving over the loss of Stevie Rae, Zoey is trying to cope with the secrets she is keeping. Problems with an evil High Priestess aside, Zoey must find a way out of the forbidden love triangle in which she is entangled and discover a way to restore Stevie Rae's soul, all while working uncomfortably close with her enemy Aphrodite. When things come undone and her secrets are revealed, Zoey faces losing the friends she depends on so dearly. Add the brutal murders of teachers at the House of Night deaths that seem to be connected to her human family and life is far from simple. Unfortunately for Zoey, it is only the beginning of the battle she must fight to save her school, her friends, and herself. Ultimately Zoey's self-centeredness and boy-craziness overshadow the more important story lines of Stevie Rae's victimization and the brewing human-vampyre war. Instead most of the book focuses on Zoey's relationships with her human boyfriend, vampyre boyfriend, and an adult teacher at the school. Nonetheless the book offers a satisfying dose of favorite characters, spell casting, and plenty of action, and ends with a cliffhanger that will leave readers clamoring for the next book. Fans of the series will not be disappointed.""Courtney Wika, VOYA

""Zoey Redbird, leader of the Dark Daughters and vampyre fledgling extraordinaire, has discovered some mysterious and disturbing events occurring at her vampyre finishing school. Her ex-roommate and best friend, Stevie Rae, is 'undead' and only due to Zoey's love and belief that she still possesses some humanity has Stevie Rae not become a true monster. Zoey must quickly find a way to reverse what has been done to her before it is too late. To complicate matters, Zoey is forced to keep this a secret from her friends and has been betrayed by her mentor and advisor, Neferet. Zoey knows that Neferet is behind the creation of these 'undead' creatures and is not at all what she seems. For help, she turns to her rival, Aphrodite, who becomes her confidante and partner in crime. Horror strikes the House of Night when two professors end up brutally murdered. Cast takes the series up a notch with this installment, and readers will be on the edge of their seats waiting for its continuation. This book is a must for any library with a vampire followingbut it does contain explicit language and sexual situations.""Donna Rosenblum, Floral Park Memorial High School, New York, School Library Journal?",Chosen: A House of Night Novel,"Kristin Cast,P.C.

In 16-year-old Zoey Redbird's world, vampyres not only exist but are also tolerated by humans. Those whom the creatures mark? as special enter the House of Night school where they will either become vampyres themselves, or, if their body rejects the change, die. To Zoey, being marked is truly a blessing, though she's scared at first. She has never fit into the human world and has always felt she is destined for something else. Her grandmother, a descendant of the Cherokee, has always supported her emotionally, and it is she who takes the girl to her new school. But even there the teen stands apart from the others. Her mark from the Goddess Nyx is a special one, showing that her powers are very strong for one so young. At the House of Night, Zoey finds true friendship, loyalty, and romance as well as mistrust and deception. She realizes that all is not right in the vampyre world and that the problems she thought she left behind exist there as well. Readers will identify with many of the characters, especially the protagonist. The story moves quickly (a little too quickly at the end) and purposely leaves many unresolved issues. A good choice for those libraries serving fans of the occult, but be aware that the book contains some suggestive language and sex.?

""Zoey Redbird is a teenage diva in every respect well, almost. She doesn't get along with her mom and she hates her stepdad. That's normal. She adores her sweet grandmother. That's normal. What makes her different from the average teenage girl is that she is a vampire. In fact, two of her three boyfriends are vampires, her best friend is one of the ghoulish undead creatures that walk the streets at night preying on homeless people, and all of the students at the private boarding school she attends are fledgling vampires, including Zoey. Plus, Zoey is the president of the student body, if you consider being in charge of the Dark Daughters to be a leadership position. Filled with secrets, Zoey's life becomes harder and harder to handle as she tries to juggle what she has to do with what she is expected to do. Her main obstacle is the high priestess, who reigns over both the 'vampyre' community and the boarding school. In this third book of the 'House of Night' series, Zoey finds strength to challenge the priestess, who she believes is not what she appears to be. (But then, who is?) Paranormal chick-lit for vampire lovers!"" Gail C. Krause, Children's Literature

""Zoey Redbird is back in this third installment of the House of Night series, which begins a month after Zoey's showdown in the tunnels with Neferet and her army of dead vampyre fledglings. While Zoey's pals are still grieving over the loss of Stevie Rae, Zoey is trying to cope with the secrets she is keeping. Problems with an evil High Priestess aside, Zoey must find a way out of the forbidden love triangle in which she is entangled and discover a way to restore Stevie Rae's soul, all while working uncomfortably close with her enemy Aphrodite. When things come undone and her secrets are revealed, Zoey faces losing the friends she depends on so dearly. Add the brutal murders of teachers at the House of Night deaths that seem to be connected to her human family and life is far from simple. Unfortunately for Zoey, it is only the beginning of the battle she must fight to save her school, her friends, and herself. Ultimately Zoey's self-centeredness and boy-craziness overshadow the more important story lines of Stevie Rae's victimization and the brewing human-vampyre war. Instead most of the book focuses on Zoey's relationships with her human boyfriend, vampyre boyfriend, and an adult teacher at the school. Nonetheless the book offers a satisfying dose of favorite characters, spell casting, and plenty of action, and ends with a cliffhanger that will leave readers clamoring for the next book. Fans of the series will not be disappointed.""Courtney Wika, VOYA

""Zoey Redbird, leader of the Dark Daughters and vampyre fledgling extraordinaire, has discovered some mysterious and disturbing events occurring at her vampyre finishing school. Her ex-roommate and best friend, Stevie Rae, is 'undead' and only due to Zoey's love and belief that she still possesses some humanity has Stevie Rae not become a true monster. Zoey must quickly find a way to reverse what has been done to her before it is too late. To complicate matters, Zoey is forced to keep this a secret from her friends and has been betrayed by her mentor and advisor, Neferet. Zoey knows that Neferet is behind the creation of these 'undead' creatures and is not at all what she seems. For help, she turns to her rival, Aphrodite, who becomes her confidante and partner in crime. Horror strikes the House of Night when two professors end up brutally murdered. Cast takes the series up a notch with this installment, and readers will be on the edge of their seats waiting for its continuation. This book is a must for any library with a vampire followingbut it does contain explicit language and sexual situations.""Donna Rosenblum, Floral Park Memorial High School, New York, School Library Journal?",Chosen: A House of Night Novel,"Kristin Cast,P.C.
