A comprehensive survey by leading basic and clinical researchers of the signal transduction mechanisms responsible for lung inflammation, including vascular hyperpermeability, white cell accumulation, and vascular remodeling. The authors cut across disciplines to bring together a broad-based presentation of inflammatory challenge, both in the initial phases of the inflammatory response, as well as in the more prolonged phase of genomic involvement. The book illuminates not only the processes of lung inflammation, but also the potential for developing new therapeutic strategies to combat inflammatory lung disease.",Cell Signaling in Vascular Inflammation,Jahar Bhattacharya, , ,Humana Press,9781588295255,"illustrated Edition,2005",222,India,English

genetic defects, by introducing genes that target these very
alterations has generated tremendous enthusiasm. This enthusiasm,
however, has been tempered by an increasing number of obstacles to
successful therapy, including vector systems that do not reach systemic
metastases, therapeutic genes with redundant mechanisms allowing for
cellular resistance, and toxicities in clinical trials that result in
premature closure. The three comprehensive sections of this volume
present currently available cancer gene therapy techniques, with
specific attention to these trouble spots. Part I describes the various
aspects of gene delivery including vehicles, or vectors, and their
respective characteristics and production methods. In Part II, the
contributors discuss strategies and targets for the treatment of
cancer, including methods for cell-death therapies, correction of
underlying genetic defects at the molecular level, and activation of
the immune system or tumor microenvironment. The contributors provide a
succinct framework for understanding the basic underlying oncogenic
changes, which encourages the development of vectors engineered to
exploit these gene mutations through selective spread of the vector in
tumor cells with the specific changes. Finally, in Part III, experts in
clinical gene therapy trials discuss the difficulties inherent in
bringing gene therapy treatment for cancer to the clinic, and principal
investigators present gene therapy approaches in the clinical testing
stage and the results that have reached the stage of clinical
testing.of these trials.",Gene Therapy For Cancer,"Kelly K. Hunt,Stephan A. Vorburger,Stephen G. Swisher", , ,Humana Press,9781588294722,"1st Edition,2007",469,India,English
