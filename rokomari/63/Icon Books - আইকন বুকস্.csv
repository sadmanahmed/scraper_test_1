Fractals are the geometry of the natural world. They're about the broken, wrinkled, wiggly world - the uneven shapes of nature, unlike the idealised forms of Euclidean geometry. We see fractals everywhere; indeed, we are fractal ourselves.
Fractal geometry is an extension of classical geometry which can make precise models of physical structures, from ferns to galaxies. It can describe the shape of a cloud as precisely as an architect can describe a house.
Introducing Fractals traces the historical development of this mathematical discipline, explores its descriptive powers in the natural world, and then looks at the applications and the implications of the discoveries it has made.
As John Archibald Wheeler, protégé of Niels Bohr, friend of Albert Einstein and mentor of Richard Feynman has said, “No one will be considered scientifically literate tomorrow, who is not familiar with fractals.'",Introducing Fractals: A Graphic Guide,"Nigel Lesmoir Gordon,Ralph Edney,Will Rood", , ,Icon Books,9781848310872,"Edition,2013",176,India,English

Lionel Andres Messi is a name to inspire and awe people. In this book, Caioli Luca draws on official interviews, testimonies from parents, family, friends, coaches, team-mates, opponents and Messi himself to spin the tale of the man who was known as the Machine of '87 for his skill at the game. The secret of the Barcelona team, his contribution towards the team's fame and fortunes are now the stuff of legend. At 21 he had already received Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year nominations, and won both the next year. By 25, he'd become the youngest player to score 200 goals in La Liga's matches. Considered the best player of his generation and perhaps the greatest of all time, he is the first football player in history to win four FIFA/Ballons d'Or, winning all of them consecutively. Updated to include the details of the 2012/13 season in which he broke all records, this book tells the story of a humble man who has risen to football glory like no one before him.
