Tolstoy's strips off Christianity's mystical veil and showcases the religion as an understanding of life, through the teachings of Jesus. Must've baffled and angered Christian nations when released in 1894, but it's even more relevant today. The Church—whether Catholic, Protestant or Orthodox—is a horrifying concept that's provided political and social power over the masses for so many centuries and Tolstoy strips it bare and proves the ineffectiveness of the Church, their doctrines, icons, relics and objects.",Kingdom of Gods and Peace Essays: 1,Leo Tolstoy, , ,Rupa & Co,9788171675159,"5th Edition,2001",544,India,English

Called upon to investigate the causes of widespread disaffection among Muslims, as reflected in the continued popularity of the so-called Wahabi movement, Hunter produced this book. W.C.Smith, author of Modern Islam in India, referred to Hunter's presentation as a 'fairly full and very convincing indictment of the Government's policy'.
