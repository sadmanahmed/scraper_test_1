Modern South Asian Literature in English ,পল ব্রায়ানস্‌ ,"","TK. 9,390",https://rokomari.com//book/101439/modern-south-asian-literature-in-english,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/rokimg_20150705_101439.gif,"A recent surge of interest in South Asian culture has met with a wealth of outstanding novels by Indian, Pakistani, and Sri Lankan authors. Increasing numbers of readers are aware of and drawn to such writers as Salman Rushdie, Bharati Mukherjee, and Arundati Roy, who regularly appear bestseller lists, win prestigious fiction awards, and are added to suggested classroom readings. This book is an ideal introduction for the student, educator, or general interested reader wishing to explore and appreciate the rich and varied worlds of South Asian literature for the first time.

Each of the book's 15 chapters introduces readers to a significant Indian, Pakistani, or Sri Lankan writer. A brief biographical background focuses on the elements most relevant to the understanding of his or her fiction. A concise overview of the author's major works is provided, while the bulk of the chapter is devoted to the explication of a single work. Critical perspectives are offered, as well as background information enabling readers to view each work as window to South Asian culture.

The works are presented in chronological order, beginning with Tagore's 1915 masterpiece Quartet and concluding with the recent bestseller The Death of Vishnu (2001) by Manil Suri. While each chapter can be enjoyed on its own, the volume is structured to trace the development of post-colonial fiction, situating the works against the historical and cultural elements that shape them. Works were selected for being the most representative of each author's output, or to present the works that are most likely to be interesting and accessible to the uninitiated reader. For this reason, short stories by Rushdie and Anita Desai are discussed instead of than their more famous novels.

This book presents a balance between historical and modern settings, divergent religious and political perspectives, a broad selection of authors and settings of geographic diversity, and a wide range of literary techniques. Readers of many backgrounds will enjoy reading about these authors, their works, and the cultural elements that make these works so fascinating. A glossary of foreign terms and further suggested readings complete the book.",Modern South Asian Literature in English,Paul Brians, , ,Greenwood Publication,9780313320118,2005,258,USA,English

"Earnings Measurement, Determination, Management, and Usefulness: An Empirical ",আহমেদ রিয়াহি-বেলকাউই,"","TK. 14,250",https://rokomari.com//book/99973/earnings-measurement--determination--management--and-usefulness--an-empirical,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/rokimg_20150620_99973.gif,"Riahi-Belkaoui examines the crucial issues involved in the determination and uses of earnings as a measure of financial performance. He points out that the nature and measurement of earnings are subject to various interpretations, that determination of earnings follows determination of net value added, and that earnings is subject to management manipulation (earnings can be smoothed, for example.) A succinct, penetrating, illuminating treatment of earnings in general as well as its particulars, the book will be especially useful to upper management and accounting professionals, and to their colleagues in the academic community. Riahi-Belkaoui argues that the interest in earnings and its related issues of measurement, determination, management, and usefulness stems from three factors: 1) the crucial importance of earnings as the shareholders' share of the corporation's wealth; 2) the reliance of investors and users on earnings and the transformation of earnings for resource allocation decision making; and 3), the direct association between the efficiency of the capital markets and timely provision of earnings data. Each chapter identifies the nature of the issues surrounding the concept of earnings and presents empirical evidence that can be used to make enlightened corporate decisions or to aid in the development of public policy.","Earnings Measurement,Determination,Management,and Usefulness: An Empirical",Ahmed Riahi-Belkaoui, , ,Greenwood Publication,9781567203301,"1st Edition,1999",200,India,English
