It provides readily available access to the experience accumulated in an endemic region covering many aspects of this disease. In compiling this book, the editors have delivered an up-to-date and comprehensive reference of interest to all who interact with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, whether it be in a clinical, laboratory or research setting. This multi-author, multidisciplinary book covers all aspects of NPC, from anatomy, histopathology, epidemiology, experimental studies, clinical manifestations, clinical and laboratory diagnostic methods to the latest imaging techniques. It also contains all of the information necessary for the clinician to correctly stage NPC and to treat the tumour efficiently. In addition, it offers guidance on screening family members in order to better control very early tumours or even precancerous conditions. Most of the authors are from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, or have had experience of working in the Far East, where the incidence of NPC is at its highest.",Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma,C.
