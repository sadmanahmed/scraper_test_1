Practical Echocardiography is a highly illustrated guide to the principles and practice of echocardiography written by cardiologists, radiologists and radiographers for all healthcare professionals needing to learn the techniques and interpretative skills involved in the scanning of the heart. It includes discussion of the main applications of echocardiography in the diagnosis of acquired heart disease, but also has specialist chapters on less common techniques, such as transoesophageal echo and the use of echocardiography in the investigation of congenital heart disease. The combination of emphasis on technique as well as diagnosis makes this book especially valuable to trainee clinicians, be they cardiologists, cardiac surgeons or radiologists, as well as the radiographer who (especially in the UK) will often be the person to perform the investigation.",Practical Echocardiography,Alison Heads, , ,Greenwich Medical Media Limited,9781900151863,"1st Edition,1999",232,India,English
