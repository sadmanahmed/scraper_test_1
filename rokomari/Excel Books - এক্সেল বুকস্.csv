As the product transcends its traditional role of satisfier, brands and branding acquire a dominant role in re-defining marketplace performance. Product superiority is no longer the sole driver of business performance since high quality products are all-pervasive, generic entities and a powerful brand can transform products into value powerhouses that command customer preference, loyalty and commitment. Effective branding gives a firm immunity from the parity spiral that can suck companies into ruinous pricing wars.

Brand Management has been written against this backdrop of redefinition of value and value creation processes. Building the context, content and consequences of branding, it combines branding theory with practical examples to make for easy reading and comprehension. Replete with examples and cases from the Indian marketing scene, the book equips readers to relate theoretical constructs with actual business scenarios, while the assignments at the end of each chapter provide ample opportunity to apply the theoretical concepts to practical situations. The themes covered in the book include the following*

    Concept of brand*
    Competition and brand*
    Brand evolution*
    Brand positioning*
    Brand over time*
    Branding strategies*
    Brand equity 


This book is an indispensable reading for students interested in the marketing area including those specializing in marketing at post graduate level, especially MBA. Practicing managers can also gain theoretical understanding of branding, and master the art and science of creating and managing powerful brands.",Brand Management: Text and Cases,Haresh V.
