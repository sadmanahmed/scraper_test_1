A comprehensive text, Graphs, Algorithms, and Optimization features clear exposition on modern algorithmic graph theory presented in a rigorous yet approachable way. The book covers major areas of graph theory including discrete optimization and its connection to graph algorithms. The authors explore surface topology from an intuitive point of view and include detailed discussions on linear programming that emphasize graph theory problems useful in mathematics and computer science. Many algorithms are provided along with the data structure needed to program the algorithms efficiently. The book also provides coverage on algorithm complexity and efficiency, NP-completeness, linear optimization, and linear programming and its relationship to graph algorithms.

Written in an accessible and informal style, this work covers nearly all areas of graph theory. Graphs, Algorithms, and Optimization provides a modern discussion of graph theory applicable to mathematics, computer science, and crossover applications.","Graphs,Algorithms,and Optimization (Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications)","William Kocay,Donald L.
