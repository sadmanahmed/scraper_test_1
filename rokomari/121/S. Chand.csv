Engineering design is the process of studying requirements, and coming up with a plan to produce a system or device that will provide a solution to the requirement or problem. The person who designs the solution has to go through the various stages of the design process to arrive at an optimal solution.

The first phase is to recognize a problem, or a situation that can be improved. The second phase involves defining the problem, that is listing the data that needs to be processed, all the constraints within which the solution should operate, like business practice, statutory requirements etc. Then, defining the kind of solution required.

Then comes the actual design process which goes through stages of conceptual design, when different plans can be created, feasibility study to determine the relevance, validity, and economic feasibility of the proposed solutions. Then comes preliminary design of the selected solution, then presentation design, planning for manufacture, planning for distribution, planning for use, and finally, planning for retirement of the product.

This book studies these aspects with relevance to machines. It begins with an introduction to the machine design process, then examines engineering materials and their properties.

The book then discusses manufacturing considerations in machine design, simple stresses in machine parts, torional and bending stresses in machine parts, and variable stresses in machine parts.

Then the book goes on to discuss pressure joints, pipes and pipe joints, riveted joints, welded joints, screwed joints, cotter and knuckle joints, keys and coupling, shafts, levers, columns and struts, and power screws.

It then looks at flat belt drives, flat belt pulleys, V-belt and rope drives, chain drives, flywheel, springs, clutches, brakes, sliding contact bearings and rolling contact bearings, spur gears, helical gears, bevel gears, worm gears, and internal combustion engine parts.

This multicolored edition includes appropriate illustrations and pictures to further elucidate the theory. It also includes sufficient number of solved and unsolved problems for clarification and practice.

The subject of refrigeration and airconditioning is one of great significance as public focus shifts to food processing and preservation technologies. This highlights the need for professionals well-versed in the basics of this technology.

A Textbook Of Refrigeration And Air Conditioning elaborates on the basics of this subject by including discussions on topics like multiple evaporator and compressor systems, simple and compound vapour compression refrigeration systems, air refrigeration cycles and systems, psychrometry, vapour absorption refrigeration and compressor systems, comfort conditions, psychrometry, refrigerants and compressors, cooling load estimation, steam jet refrigeration system, evaporators, condensers, expansion devices, and food preservation including cryogenics, fans, and ducts.

A Textbook Of Refrigeration And Air Conditioning also features practical applications of refrigeration and air conditioning, thereby helping to buttress the theoretical knowledge already gleaned.

The revised edition features colour pictures and refrigeration tables with charts, which help enhance the value of the content and assist students to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Fluid Mechanics is the study of fluids including plasma, liquids and gases and the forces that operate on them. This field of physics has three sub-branches, fluid kinematics, the study of fluids in motion, fluid statistics, the study of fluids at rest and fluid dynamics, the study of the effect of forces operating on fluid motion.

Engineering Fluid Mechanics contains a unique chapter number zero at the beginning of the book containing a description of the importance of the book with the help of pictures. The book also contains revised figures and is therefore an improved version when compared to its previous editions. It also has additional solved examples that help in better revision. The chapters have also been revised for better clarity and explanation. There are also references at suitable places for accessing related material on the internet.

Engineering Fluid Mechanics has chapters on The Importance Of Fluid Mechanics, Introductory Concepts, Fluid Kinematics, Fluid Statics, Fluid Dynamics, Measurement Of Flow, Laminar Flow, Boundary Layer Flow, Flow Through Pipes, Flow Around Immersed Bodies, Compressible Flow, Flow Through Open Channels, Dimensional Analysis and Similitude, and Fluid Machines. The book also contains appendices and nomenclature.
