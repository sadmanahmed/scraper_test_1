The second edition of Food Microbiology: an Introduction offers authoritative coverage as well as an appealing design for today's instructors and students. This impressive second edition by Thomas Montville and Karl Matthews builds upon the earlier edition's success covering the complex field of food microbiology while also motivating students to venture beyond memorization to a broader understanding of the concepts.

Following up on the critical success of the first edition, this textbook presents a classroom-friendly adaptation that has been student tested for level and depth of coverage. This new edition offers a straightforward approach to learning the core principles without sacrificing depth, clarity, or rigor. It introduces the genetics and mechanisms important to specific issues in food microbiology. This textbook encourages today's students to acquire the understanding and skills necessary for practicing food safety in the future.

The textbook has been completely updated based on student input and on new discoveries in food microbiology. Organized into five major sections, which can be taught in any order, this new edition adds important new details, including expanded coverage of food fermentations. Additionally, this student-friendly textbook employs attractive instructive material such as text boxes, case studies, chapter summaries, questions for critical thought, and a glossary. The first section, ""Basics of Food Microbiology,"" cements foundational material, while the next four sections detail specific food-borne organisms and strategies for controlling them. Descriptions of outbreaks of food-related infections inject life into each pathogen covered.
