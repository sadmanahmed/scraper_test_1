This edition of Performance Management through Training and Development reflects these changes.

Key Feature*

    New coverage of self-development*
    More graphical/visual representation of concepts*
    The Great Training Debate presents a debatable issue that can be used early in a class to get students discussing a topic or later in a class so students can apply the chapter material to an important training issue*
    We have also added a case incident to each chapter. This was based on the comments of some reviewers, who felt that some of the cases were too long
