Cleopatra VII Philopator ascended the throne of Egypt during a time when the Pyramids and the Sphinx were already legendary achievements of the past. She rose at a time when Egypt was facing annexation by a cruel foe. Instead, she used the one power at her disposal, her feminine wiles, to play with the men around her and orchestrate events as she saw fit. From Julius Caesar to Marc Anthony, her affairs have taken their place in the world of romance stories as some of the most tragic and most unique. The sole proof of her legacy is the name, the fact that despite there having been several women in Egypt with that name, there is only one woman who comes to mind when anyone mentions Cleopatra. In this book, M. J. Trow outlines her life from the line of the Ptolemy who served Alexander the Great to her days after the betrayal and assassination of Julius Caesar. He explains the society prevalent at the time and the hurdles that Cleopatra would have likely faced, giving readers a detailed account of the Egypt of the time. In painting a picture of her life, to the moment of her legendary death most probably at the fangs of her pet asp, Trow gives readers a succinct and vivid portrayal of the most beautiful woman in history, one who was desired by all the men around her.
