Cities and Urban Cultures ,ডিবোরাহ স্টিভেনশন,"TK. 1,035","",https://rokomari.com//book/101826/cities-and-urban-cultures,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/rokimg_20150709_101826.gif,"What is distinctive about urban life? — What key trends have shaped the contemporary city? — How have city and urban cultures been explained by sociology and cultural studies?

This is the first book to explore cities and urban life from the perspectives of both sociology and cultural theory. Through an interdisciplinary approach and use of case studies, “Cities and Urban Cultures” demonstrates that the ‘real’ city of physicality and struggle and the ‘imagined’ city of representations are entwined in the construction of urban cultures. 

Starting with a comparison of the rural and the urban, it considers ways on imagining the city and of conceptualizing urban cultures. It goes on to investigate the implications of several pivotal urban and cultural trends, such as the use of the arts and local cultures in forging new images for cities and the ways in which modernism, postmodernism and globalization have shaped the built environment and the orientation of academic enquiry. Also examined is the way in which representations of the urban landscape in film, literature, art, and popular texts, have informed dominant ideas about the way certain city spaces – including city centres, urban waterfronts, and so-called ‘global cities’ – should look, function and ‘feel’.

Designed as a text for undergraduate courses in cultural studies, sociology and wider social science, this book traces the development of urban environments from the nineteenth century to the present, and illuminates the nature of urban life.

Further, among the less developed regions, levels of urbanization in Asia and Africa were the lowest, that is, about 37 per cent. According to UN HABITAT, 2006, Asia and Africa will host the largest population in the 21st century and not only cities will continue to be the sites of extreme inequality, it is also feared that Asian cities may not be able to cope with the pace of urbanization. Keeping with the trends in the world, there is also spurt in urbanization in India, which poses serious challenges for both urban development and urban governance. Earlier, urban development did not receive much attention in India, primarily due to low rate of urbanization. In 2005, it was taken as a serious agenda by the government when Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission was launched.

Divided into three sections, the present anthology focuses on the challenges of urbanization and urban development for the ongoing and future governance. Due to unprecedented urbanization and urban growth, urban development has got a serious setback and is also depleting the quality of urban life. The challenges are manifold and in that context urban governance needs to be looked at from a fresh perspective and be given serious consideration to avoid further urban chaos and crisis. The present volume is an effort to bring together diverse perspectives on the urban governance to have comprehensive mapping of the urban issue in India.

The new market systems, emerged under the new global regime, have cut across countries. This mega-transformation has made significant impact on existing cities and towns. Across countries, a few cities are emerging as the hubs of flow of capital and new technologies under the ever-growing information technologies and labor markets. In this process, traditional centers of regional production and distribution of goods and services are getting reorganized or disintegrated. In this context, there is a strong need to understand the impact of such changes on India's urban settlements, more so for the small cities and towns which have remained neglected in urban research. This book includes more than a dozen contributions based on a seminar held at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (Mumbai). The selected papers mainly fall under two categories: those focusing on the global agenda and its possible impact on India's urban settlements, and those which detail the emerging changes and their impact on socio-cultural and economic life situations of citizens of specific cities and towns. The first set of papers is more based on theoretical underpinnings and emerging perspectives on changing small cities and towns of India, while the second group of papers presents case studies on such settlements.",Small Cities and Towns in Global Era: Emerging Changes and Perspectives, , ,"R.
