Born 1706 in Boston, Benjamin Franklin was the 15th of his father's 17 children. He went to school as a child with the intent of becoming a minister, as his father, Josiah, intended. However, that idea was dropped after Franklin showed a keen interest in reading and writing. He was apprenticed to his brother, James at a young age, but after fighting with his brother he quit the job and moved to Philadelphia, where he worked for a man named Samuel Keimer. After befriending some prominent political figures, including the royal Governor, Franklin left for England, where he spent 18 months working for a printer with his friend James Ralph, with whom he later became estranged. Shortly after returning to America in 1726, Franklin formed a debating club called the Junto. Two years later, he took over The Pennsylvania Gazette from Keimer and turned it into a successful publication with tools from London. In 1730, Franklin wed his old sweetheart, Deborah Read, with whom he had two children. The first, William Franklin, was born approximately one year later; he is the man to whom the Autobiography is addressed in Part One.

Throughout the 1730s, Franklin held some minor positions doing printing work for the government. In that time, he began Poor Richard's Almanac and became postmaster of Philadelphia. Towards the end of the decade, he invented the Franklin stove. In the 1740s, Franklin worked on several projects, including the fire brigade, the police force, the University of Pennsylvania, the street sweeping service and some other smaller public works projects. He retired from the printing business in 1748 and began to conduct scientific experiments in lightning. In 1753, he was awarded honorary degrees from Harvard and Yale, and he became Postmaster General of America. The following year, when war broke out between England and France (the French and Indian War Franklin began to draft proposals outlining means by which funds could be raised for colonial defense. He succeeded in many of his proposals, and he personally played a large part in organizing the war effort. The Autobiography, however, breaks off in 1757; it is left unfinished.

The Autobiography itself was written in three different times: 1771 in England, 1783-83 in France, and 1788 in America. If Franklin meant to complete it, he died before he got the chance.

Flap Of The Book:
The Private Life of Benjamin Franklin, Written by Himself, became the most popular
ever written. Franklin would have expected no less. It would have given him endless pleasure and delight. He wrote to
be read, by everyone ... He wanted his dear reader - you, dear reader – to reach out, pull that book down - pull this book down - press it open, and read within it the story of his life. But he knew, too, that to pull Franklin down from a shelf and
turn to the first page of the book of his life is to open him up the way the gowned anatomist plunges into a pale and waxen corpse: with a sharp knife.'",The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin ,Benjamin Franklin, , ,Simon & Schuster,9780743255066,"1st Edition,2004",143,India,English

But what if there was a way to teach children how to manage priorities, focus on goals and be a positive influence on the world around them?

The Leader in Me is that programme. It's based on a hugely successful initiative carried out at the A.B. Combs Elementary School in North Carolina. To hear the parents of A. B Combs talk about the school is to be amazed. In 1999, the school debuted a programme that taught The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to a pilot group of students. The parents reported an incredible change in their children, who blossomed under the programme. By the end of the following year the average end-of-grade scores had leapt from 84 to 94.

This book will launch the message onto a much larger platform. Stephen R. Covey takes the 7 Habits, that have already changed the lives of millions of people, and shows how children can use them as they develop. Those habits -- be proactive, begin with the end in mind, put first things first, think win-win, seek to understand and then to be understood, synergize, and sharpen the saw -- are critical skills to learn at a young age and bring incredible results, proving that it's never too early to teach someone how to live well.

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, first published in 1989, is a business and self-help book written by Stephen Covey. Covey presents an approach to being effective in attaining goals by aligning oneself to what he calls ""true north"" principles based on a character ethic that he presents as universal and timeless.

Covey defines effectiveness as the balance of obtaining desirable results with caring for that which produces those results. He illustrates this by referring to the fable of the goose that laid the golden eggs. He further claims that effectiveness can be expressed in terms of the P/PC ratio, where P refers to getting desired results and PC is caring for that which produces the results.

Covey's best-known book, it has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide since its first publication. The audio version became the first non-fiction audio-book in U.S. publishing history to sell more than one million copies. Covey argues against what he calls ""the personality ethic"", that he sees as prevalent in many modern self-help books. He promotes what he labels ""the character ethic"": aligning one's values with so-called universal and timeless principles. In doing this, Covey is deliberately and mindfully separating principles and values. He sees principles as external natural laws, while values remain internal and subjective. Our values govern our behavior, while principles ultimately determine the consequences. Covey presents his teachings in a series of habits, manifesting as a progression from dependence through independence on to interdependence.",The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People,Stephen R.

In any conflict, it is usually believed that there are two alternatives – the first being the personal alternative and the second being the other person’s alternative. It always comes down to an argument as to whose way is better among the two. But Stephen, in this book, attempts to introduce readers to a third alternative, which draws the best from both sides of a debate and ignore the negatives from both the parties. It helps in the emergence of a whole new place from a mere debate, where everyone is a winner and the conflict is also resolved. The 3rd Alternative signifies a completely new way of thinking that will be incorporated not only by his ardent fans, but also by anyone who seeks resolution in their professional and private lives.

The author became famous with her book and film, The Secret. In that book she explained the Law of Attraction and the power of positive thinking. This third book shows how expressing gratitude for everything one has will attract more good things into their lives.

The author says she received inspiration for The Magic from a sacred text, The Gospel of Matthew. Rhonda Byrnes says a person who is thankful for all the good things in their life will attract more of those good things. Those who do not express thanks for their blessings will end up losing what they have.

Expressing gratitude is a good positive practice that makes the person recall all the good things they have in their life, instead of focusing just on the negatives. This in turn can foster positive attitudes and make the person more constructive and upbeat in their life.

The Magic takes the reader on almost a month long journey. It has an action plan for 28 days, that helps them incorporate the concept of gratitude into their life. It shows them through a single exercise each day, how to express gratitude for past and present blessings and how to invite good things in the future through the act of expressing thankfulness.

Most people, in the rush and tension of the modern day lifestyle, tend to forget the great things that they have been blessed with, things like a good family, good health and so on. They instead obsess over the negatives and this makes them negative in their attitudes and actions too.

Fostering a sense of gratitude can make people more cheerful and positive by reminding them of the good aspects of their lives. The Magic is thus a manual for improving one’s viewpoints and directions in life.

In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare creates a violent world, in which two young people fall in love. It is not simply that their families disapprove; the Montagues and the Capulets are engaged in a blood feud.

In this death-filled setting, the movement from love at first sight to the lovers’ final union in death seems almost inevitable. And yet, this play set in an extraordinary world has become the quintessential story of young love. In part because of its exquisite language, it is easy to respond as if it were about all young lovers.

The authoritative edition of Romeo and Juliet from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:

*Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play
*Newly revised explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play
*Scene-by-scene plot summaries
*A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases
*An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language
*An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play
*Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books
*An up-to-date annotated guide to further reading",Romeo and Juliet,William Shakespeare, , ,Simon & Schuster,9780743477116,"1st Edition,2004",354,India,English

In covey's experience, the thing that most undermines the ability to execute goals is what he calls the whirlwind Those urgent tasks that must be done simply to keep an organization alive. As covey shows, the only way to execute new, important goals is to separate those goals from the whirlwind.

The four disciplines allow leaders to create a strategy that requires a change in behavior, since only by ensuring that everyone on the team understands the goal, knows what to do to reach it and knows whether progress is being made, will a leader produce consistent breakthrough results while sustaining the urgent work of the whirl wind. The four disciplines of execution are

    1. Focus on the wildly important
    2. Act on the lead measures
    3. Keep a compelling scoreboard
    4. Create a cadence of accountability.


For more than a decade Franklin covey has been studying what it takes to achieve important goals and in this book they share success stories from a wide range of companies that have implemented the four disciplines to result in greater profits, increased market share and improved customer satisfaction.

Born 1706 in Boston, Benjamin Franklin was the 15th of his father's 17 children. He went to school as a child with the intent of becoming a minister, as his father, Josiah, intended. However, that idea was dropped after Franklin showed a keen interest in reading and writing. He was apprenticed to his brother, James at a young age, but after fighting with his brother he quit the job and moved to Philadelphia, where he worked for a man named Samuel Keimer. After befriending some prominent political figures, including the royal Governor, Franklin left for England, where he spent 18 months working for a printer with his friend James Ralph, with whom he later became estranged. Shortly after returning to America in 1726, Franklin formed a debating club called the Junto. Two years later, he took over The Pennsylvania Gazette from Keimer and turned it into a successful publication with tools from London. In 1730, Franklin wed his old sweetheart, Deborah Read, with whom he had two children. The first, William Franklin, was born approximately one year later; he is the man to whom the Autobiography is addressed in Part One.

Throughout the 1730s, Franklin held some minor positions doing printing work for the government. In that time, he began Poor Richard's Almanac and became postmaster of Philadelphia. Towards the end of the decade, he invented the Franklin stove. In the 1740s, Franklin worked on several projects, including the fire brigade, the police force, the University of Pennsylvania, the street sweeping service and some other smaller public works projects. He retired from the printing business in 1748 and began to conduct scientific experiments in lightning. In 1753, he was awarded honorary degrees from Harvard and Yale, and he became Postmaster General of America. The following year, when war broke out between England and France (the French and Indian War Franklin began to draft proposals outlining means by which funds could be raised for colonial defense. He succeeded in many of his proposals, and he personally played a large part in organizing the war effort. The Autobiography, however, breaks off in 1757; it is left unfinished.

The Autobiography itself was written in three different times: 1771 in England, 1783-83 in France, and 1788 in America. If Franklin meant to complete it, he died before he got the chance.

Flap Of The Book:
The Private Life of Benjamin Franklin, Written by Himself, became the most popular
ever written. Franklin would have expected no less. It would have given him endless pleasure and delight. He wrote to
be read, by everyone ... He wanted his dear reader - you, dear reader – to reach out, pull that book down - pull this book down - press it open, and read within it the story of his life. But he knew, too, that to pull Franklin down from a shelf and
turn to the first page of the book of his life is to open him up the way the gowned anatomist plunges into a pale and waxen corpse: with a sharp knife.'",The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin ,Benjamin Franklin, , ,Simon & Schuster,9780743255066,"1st Edition,2004",143,India,English

But what if there was a way to teach children how to manage priorities, focus on goals and be a positive influence on the world around them?

The Leader in Me is that programme. It's based on a hugely successful initiative carried out at the A.B. Combs Elementary School in North Carolina. To hear the parents of A. B Combs talk about the school is to be amazed. In 1999, the school debuted a programme that taught The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to a pilot group of students. The parents reported an incredible change in their children, who blossomed under the programme. By the end of the following year the average end-of-grade scores had leapt from 84 to 94.

This book will launch the message onto a much larger platform. Stephen R. Covey takes the 7 Habits, that have already changed the lives of millions of people, and shows how children can use them as they develop. Those habits -- be proactive, begin with the end in mind, put first things first, think win-win, seek to understand and then to be understood, synergize, and sharpen the saw -- are critical skills to learn at a young age and bring incredible results, proving that it's never too early to teach someone how to live well.

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, first published in 1989, is a business and self-help book written by Stephen Covey. Covey presents an approach to being effective in attaining goals by aligning oneself to what he calls ""true north"" principles based on a character ethic that he presents as universal and timeless.

Covey defines effectiveness as the balance of obtaining desirable results with caring for that which produces those results. He illustrates this by referring to the fable of the goose that laid the golden eggs. He further claims that effectiveness can be expressed in terms of the P/PC ratio, where P refers to getting desired results and PC is caring for that which produces the results.

Covey's best-known book, it has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide since its first publication. The audio version became the first non-fiction audio-book in U.S. publishing history to sell more than one million copies. Covey argues against what he calls ""the personality ethic"", that he sees as prevalent in many modern self-help books. He promotes what he labels ""the character ethic"": aligning one's values with so-called universal and timeless principles. In doing this, Covey is deliberately and mindfully separating principles and values. He sees principles as external natural laws, while values remain internal and subjective. Our values govern our behavior, while principles ultimately determine the consequences. Covey presents his teachings in a series of habits, manifesting as a progression from dependence through independence on to interdependence.",The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People,Stephen R.

The Secret contains wisdom from modern-day teachers -- men and women who have used it to achieve health, wealth, and happiness.

In any conflict, it is usually believed that there are two alternatives – the first being the personal alternative and the second being the other person’s alternative. It always comes down to an argument as to whose way is better among the two. But Stephen, in this book, attempts to introduce readers to a third alternative, which draws the best from both sides of a debate and ignore the negatives from both the parties. It helps in the emergence of a whole new place from a mere debate, where everyone is a winner and the conflict is also resolved. The 3rd Alternative signifies a completely new way of thinking that will be incorporated not only by his ardent fans, but also by anyone who seeks resolution in their professional and private lives.

The author became famous with her book and film, The Secret. In that book she explained the Law of Attraction and the power of positive thinking. This third book shows how expressing gratitude for everything one has will attract more good things into their lives.

The author says she received inspiration for The Magic from a sacred text, The Gospel of Matthew. Rhonda Byrnes says a person who is thankful for all the good things in their life will attract more of those good things. Those who do not express thanks for their blessings will end up losing what they have.

Expressing gratitude is a good positive practice that makes the person recall all the good things they have in their life, instead of focusing just on the negatives. This in turn can foster positive attitudes and make the person more constructive and upbeat in their life.

The Magic takes the reader on almost a month long journey. It has an action plan for 28 days, that helps them incorporate the concept of gratitude into their life. It shows them through a single exercise each day, how to express gratitude for past and present blessings and how to invite good things in the future through the act of expressing thankfulness.

Most people, in the rush and tension of the modern day lifestyle, tend to forget the great things that they have been blessed with, things like a good family, good health and so on. They instead obsess over the negatives and this makes them negative in their attitudes and actions too.

Fostering a sense of gratitude can make people more cheerful and positive by reminding them of the good aspects of their lives. The Magic is thus a manual for improving one’s viewpoints and directions in life.

In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare creates a violent world, in which two young people fall in love. It is not simply that their families disapprove; the Montagues and the Capulets are engaged in a blood feud.

In this death-filled setting, the movement from love at first sight to the lovers’ final union in death seems almost inevitable. And yet, this play set in an extraordinary world has become the quintessential story of young love. In part because of its exquisite language, it is easy to respond as if it were about all young lovers.

The authoritative edition of Romeo and Juliet from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:

*Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play
*Newly revised explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play
*Scene-by-scene plot summaries
*A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases
*An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language

In covey's experience, the thing that most undermines the ability to execute goals is what he calls the whirlwind Those urgent tasks that must be done simply to keep an organization alive. As covey shows, the only way to execute new, important goals is to separate those goals from the whirlwind.

The four disciplines allow leaders to create a strategy that requires a change in behavior, since only by ensuring that everyone on the team understands the goal, knows what to do to reach it and knows whether progress is being made, will a leader produce consistent breakthrough results while sustaining the urgent work of the whirl wind. The four disciplines of execution are

    1. Focus on the wildly important
    2. Act on the lead measures
    3. Keep a compelling scoreboard
    4. Create a cadence of accountability.


For more than a decade Franklin covey has been studying what it takes to achieve important goals and in this book they share success stories from a wide range of companies that have implemented the four disciplines to result in greater profits, increased market share and improved customer satisfaction.

Born 1706 in Boston, Benjamin Franklin was the 15th of his father's 17 children. He went to school as a child with the intent of becoming a minister, as his father, Josiah, intended. However, that idea was dropped after Franklin showed a keen interest in reading and writing. He was apprenticed to his brother, James at a young age, but after fighting with his brother he quit the job and moved to Philadelphia, where he worked for a man named Samuel Keimer. After befriending some prominent political figures, including the royal Governor, Franklin left for England, where he spent 18 months working for a printer with his friend James Ralph, with whom he later became estranged. Shortly after returning to America in 1726, Franklin formed a debating club called the Junto. Two years later, he took over The Pennsylvania Gazette from Keimer and turned it into a successful publication with tools from London. In 1730, Franklin wed his old sweetheart, Deborah Read, with whom he had two children. The first, William Franklin, was born approximately one year later; he is the man to whom the Autobiography is addressed in Part One.

Throughout the 1730s, Franklin held some minor positions doing printing work for the government. In that time, he began Poor Richard's Almanac and became postmaster of Philadelphia. Towards the end of the decade, he invented the Franklin stove. In the 1740s, Franklin worked on several projects, including the fire brigade, the police force, the University of Pennsylvania, the street sweeping service and some other smaller public works projects. He retired from the printing business in 1748 and began to conduct scientific experiments in lightning. In 1753, he was awarded honorary degrees from Harvard and Yale, and he became Postmaster General of America. The following year, when war broke out between England and France (the French and Indian War Franklin began to draft proposals outlining means by which funds could be raised for colonial defense. He succeeded in many of his proposals, and he personally played a large part in organizing the war effort. The Autobiography, however, breaks off in 1757; it is left unfinished.

The Autobiography itself was written in three different times: 1771 in England, 1783-83 in France, and 1788 in America. If Franklin meant to complete it, he died before he got the chance.

Flap Of The Book:
The Private Life of Benjamin Franklin, Written by Himself, became the most popular
ever written. Franklin would have expected no less. It would have given him endless pleasure and delight. He wrote to
be read, by everyone ... He wanted his dear reader - you, dear reader – to reach out, pull that book down - pull this book down - press it open, and read within it the story of his life. But he knew, too, that to pull Franklin down from a shelf and
turn to the first page of the book of his life is to open him up the way the gowned anatomist plunges into a pale and waxen corpse: with a sharp knife.'",The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin ,Benjamin Franklin, , ,Simon & Schuster,9780743255066,"1st Edition,2004",143,India,English

But what if there was a way to teach children how to manage priorities, focus on goals and be a positive influence on the world around them?

The Leader in Me is that programme. It's based on a hugely successful initiative carried out at the A.B. Combs Elementary School in North Carolina. To hear the parents of A. B Combs talk about the school is to be amazed. In 1999, the school debuted a programme that taught The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to a pilot group of students. The parents reported an incredible change in their children, who blossomed under the programme. By the end of the following year the average end-of-grade scores had leapt from 84 to 94.

This book will launch the message onto a much larger platform. Stephen R. Covey takes the 7 Habits, that have already changed the lives of millions of people, and shows how children can use them as they develop. Those habits -- be proactive, begin with the end in mind, put first things first, think win-win, seek to understand and then to be understood, synergize, and sharpen the saw -- are critical skills to learn at a young age and bring incredible results, proving that it's never too early to teach someone how to live well.

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, first published in 1989, is a business and self-help book written by Stephen Covey. Covey presents an approach to being effective in attaining goals by aligning oneself to what he calls ""true north"" principles based on a character ethic that he presents as universal and timeless.

Covey defines effectiveness as the balance of obtaining desirable results with caring for that which produces those results. He illustrates this by referring to the fable of the goose that laid the golden eggs. He further claims that effectiveness can be expressed in terms of the P/PC ratio, where P refers to getting desired results and PC is caring for that which produces the results.

Covey's best-known book, it has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide since its first publication. The audio version became the first non-fiction audio-book in U.S. publishing history to sell more than one million copies. Covey argues against what he calls ""the personality ethic"", that he sees as prevalent in many modern self-help books. He promotes what he labels ""the character ethic"": aligning one's values with so-called universal and timeless principles. In doing this, Covey is deliberately and mindfully separating principles and values. He sees principles as external natural laws, while values remain internal and subjective. Our values govern our behavior, while principles ultimately determine the consequences. Covey presents his teachings in a series of habits, manifesting as a progression from dependence through independence on to interdependence.",The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People,Stephen R.

This tells the poignant tale of a Chinese farmer and his family in old agrarian China. The humble Wang Lung glories in the soil he works, nurturing the land as it nurtures him and his family.

In this book, you'll learn how to use The Secret in every aspect of your life -- money, health, relationships, happiness, and in every interaction you have in the world. You'll begin to understand the hidden, untapped power that's within you, and this revelation can bring joy to every aspect of your life.

Supporters will hail this New Age self-help book on the law of attraction as a groundbreaking and life-changing work, finding validation in its thesis that one's positive thoughts are powerful magnets that attract wealth, health, happiness... and did we mention wealth? Detractors will be appalled by this as well as when the book argues that fleeting negative thoughts are powerful enough to create terminal illness, poverty and even widespread disasters.

The Secret contains wisdom from modern-day teachers -- men and women who have used it to achieve health, wealth, and happiness. By applying the knowledge of The Secret, they bring to light compelling stories of eradicating disease, acquiring massive wealth, overcoming obstacles, and achieving what many would regard as impossible.

In any conflict, it is usually believed that there are two alternatives – the first being the personal alternative and the second being the other person’s alternative. It always comes down to an argument as to whose way is better among the two. But Stephen, in this book, attempts to introduce readers to a third alternative, which draws the best from both sides of a debate and ignore the negatives from both the parties. It helps in the emergence of a whole new place from a mere debate, where everyone is a winner and the conflict is also resolved. The 3rd Alternative signifies a completely new way of thinking that will be incorporated not only by his ardent fans, but also by anyone who seeks resolution in their professional and private lives.

The author became famous with her book and film, The Secret. In that book she explained the Law of Attraction and the power of positive thinking. This third book shows how expressing gratitude for everything one has will attract more good things into their lives.

The author says she received inspiration for The Magic from a sacred text, The Gospel of Matthew. Rhonda Byrnes says a person who is thankful for all the good things in their life will attract more of those good things. Those who do not express thanks for their blessings will end up losing what they have.

Expressing gratitude is a good positive practice that makes the person recall all the good things they have in their life, instead of focusing just on the negatives. This in turn can foster positive attitudes and make the person more constructive and upbeat in their life.

The Magic takes the reader on almost a month long journey. It has an action plan for 28 days, that helps them incorporate the concept of gratitude into their life. It shows them through a single exercise each day, how to express gratitude for past and present blessings and how to invite good things in the future through the act of expressing thankfulness.

Most people, in the rush and tension of the modern day lifestyle, tend to forget the great things that they have been blessed with, things like a good family, good health and so on. They instead obsess over the negatives and this makes them negative in their attitudes and actions too.

Fostering a sense of gratitude can make people more cheerful and positive by reminding them of the good aspects of their lives. The Magic is thus a manual for improving one’s viewpoints and directions in life.

In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare creates a violent world, in which two young people fall in love. It is not simply that their families disapprove; the Montagues and the Capulets are engaged in a blood feud.

In this death-filled setting, the movement from love at first sight to the lovers’ final union in death seems almost inevitable. And yet, this play set in an extraordinary world has become the quintessential story of young love. In part because of its exquisite language, it is easy to respond as if it were about all young lovers.

The authoritative edition of Romeo and Juliet from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:

*Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play
*Newly revised explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play
*Scene-by-scene plot summaries
*A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases
*An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language
*An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play
*Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books
*An up-to-date annotated guide to further reading",Romeo and Juliet,William Shakespeare, , ,Simon & Schuster,9780743477116,"1st Edition,2004",354,India,English

In covey's experience, the thing that most undermines the ability to execute goals is what he calls the whirlwind Those urgent tasks that must be done simply to keep an organization alive. As covey shows, the only way to execute new, important goals is to separate those goals from the whirlwind.

The four disciplines allow leaders to create a strategy that requires a change in behavior, since only by ensuring that everyone on the team understands the goal, knows what to do to reach it and knows whether progress is being made, will a leader produce consistent breakthrough results while sustaining the urgent work of the whirl wind. The four disciplines of execution are

    1. Focus on the wildly important
    2. Act on the lead measures
    3. Keep a compelling scoreboard
    4. Create a cadence of accountability.


For more than a decade Franklin covey has been studying what it takes to achieve important goals and in this book they share success stories from a wide range of companies that have implemented the four disciplines to result in greater profits, increased market share and improved customer satisfaction.

Born 1706 in Boston, Benjamin Franklin was the 15th of his father's 17 children. He went to school as a child with the intent of becoming a minister, as his father, Josiah, intended. However, that idea was dropped after Franklin showed a keen interest in reading and writing. He was apprenticed to his brother, James at a young age, but after fighting with his brother he quit the job and moved to Philadelphia, where he worked for a man named Samuel Keimer. After befriending some prominent political figures, including the royal Governor, Franklin left for England, where he spent 18 months working for a printer with his friend James Ralph, with whom he later became estranged. Shortly after returning to America in 1726, Franklin formed a debating club called the Junto. Two years later, he took over The Pennsylvania Gazette from Keimer and turned it into a successful publication with tools from London. In 1730, Franklin wed his old sweetheart, Deborah Read, with whom he had two children. The first, William Franklin, was born approximately one year later; he is the man to whom the Autobiography is addressed in Part One.

Throughout the 1730s, Franklin held some minor positions doing printing work for the government. In that time, he began Poor Richard's Almanac and became postmaster of Philadelphia. Towards the end of the decade, he invented the Franklin stove. In the 1740s, Franklin worked on several projects, including the fire brigade, the police force, the University of Pennsylvania, the street sweeping service and some other smaller public works projects. He retired from the printing business in 1748 and began to conduct scientific experiments in lightning. In 1753, he was awarded honorary degrees from Harvard and Yale, and he became Postmaster General of America. The following year, when war broke out between England and France (the French and Indian War Franklin began to draft proposals outlining means by which funds could be raised for colonial defense. He succeeded in many of his proposals, and he personally played a large part in organizing the war effort. The Autobiography, however, breaks off in 1757; it is left unfinished.

The Autobiography itself was written in three different times: 1771 in England, 1783-83 in France, and 1788 in America. If Franklin meant to complete it, he died before he got the chance.

Flap Of The Book:
The Private Life of Benjamin Franklin, Written by Himself, became the most popular
ever written. Franklin would have expected no less. It would have given him endless pleasure and delight. He wrote to
be read, by everyone ... He wanted his dear reader - you, dear reader – to reach out, pull that book down - pull this book down - press it open, and read within it the story of his life. But he knew, too, that to pull Franklin down from a shelf and
turn to the first page of the book of his life is to open him up the way the gowned anatomist plunges into a pale and waxen corpse: with a sharp knife.'",The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin ,Benjamin Franklin, , ,Simon & Schuster,9780743255066,"1st Edition,2004",143,India,English

But what if there was a way to teach children how to manage priorities, focus on goals and be a positive influence on the world around them?

The Leader in Me is that programme. It's based on a hugely successful initiative carried out at the A.B. Combs Elementary School in North Carolina. To hear the parents of A. B Combs talk about the school is to be amazed. In 1999, the school debuted a programme that taught The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to a pilot group of students. The parents reported an incredible change in their children, who blossomed under the programme. By the end of the following year the average end-of-grade scores had leapt from 84 to 94.

This book will launch the message onto a much larger platform. Stephen R. Covey takes the 7 Habits, that have already changed the lives of millions of people, and shows how children can use them as they develop. Those habits -- be proactive, begin with the end in mind, put first things first, think win-win, seek to understand and then to be understood, synergize, and sharpen the saw -- are critical skills to learn at a young age and bring incredible results, proving that it's never too early to teach someone how to live well.

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, first published in 1989, is a business and self-help book written by Stephen Covey. Covey presents an approach to being effective in attaining goals by aligning oneself to what he calls ""true north"" principles based on a character ethic that he presents as universal and timeless.

Covey defines effectiveness as the balance of obtaining desirable results with caring for that which produces those results. He illustrates this by referring to the fable of the goose that laid the golden eggs. He further claims that effectiveness can be expressed in terms of the P/PC ratio, where P refers to getting desired results and PC is caring for that which produces the results.

Covey's best-known book, it has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide since its first publication. The audio version became the first non-fiction audio-book in U.S. publishing history to sell more than one million copies. Covey argues against what he calls ""the personality ethic"", that he sees as prevalent in many modern self-help books. He promotes what he labels ""the character ethic"": aligning one's values with so-called universal and timeless principles. In doing this, Covey is deliberately and mindfully separating principles and values. He sees principles as external natural laws, while values remain internal and subjective. Our values govern our behavior, while principles ultimately determine the consequences. Covey presents his teachings in a series of habits, manifesting as a progression from dependence through independence on to interdependence.",The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People,Stephen R.

In any conflict, it is usually believed that there are two alternatives – the first being the personal alternative and the second being the other person’s alternative. It always comes down to an argument as to whose way is better among the two. But Stephen, in this book, attempts to introduce readers to a third alternative, which draws the best from both sides of a debate and ignore the negatives from both the parties. It helps in the emergence of a whole new place from a mere debate, where everyone is a winner and the conflict is also resolved. The 3rd Alternative signifies a completely new way of thinking that will be incorporated not only by his ardent fans, but also by anyone who seeks resolution in their professional and private lives.

The Magic ,রোন্ডা বাইর্ন,TK. 810,"",https://rokomari.com//book/101117/the-magic,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/rokimg_20150725_101117.gif,"Summary Of The Book

The author became famous with her book and film, The Secret. In that book she explained the Law of Attraction and the power of positive thinking. This third book shows how expressing gratitude for everything one has will attract more good things into their lives.

The author says she received inspiration for The Magic from a sacred text, The Gospel of Matthew. Rhonda Byrnes says a person who is thankful for all the good things in their life will attract more of those good things. Those who do not express thanks for their blessings will end up losing what they have.

Expressing gratitude is a good positive practice that makes the person recall all the good things they have in their life, instead of focusing just on the negatives. This in turn can foster positive attitudes and make the person more constructive and upbeat in their life.

The Magic takes the reader on almost a month long journey. It has an action plan for 28 days, that helps them incorporate the concept of gratitude into their life. It shows them through a single exercise each day, how to express gratitude for past and present blessings and how to invite good things in the future through the act of expressing thankfulness.

Most people, in the rush and tension of the modern day lifestyle, tend to forget the great things that they have been blessed with, things like a good family, good health and so on. They instead obsess over the negatives and this makes them negative in their attitudes and actions too.

Fostering a sense of gratitude can make people more cheerful and positive by reminding them of the good aspects of their lives. The Magic is thus a manual for improving one’s viewpoints and directions in life.

In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare creates a violent world, in which two young people fall in love. It is not simply that their families disapprove; the Montagues and the Capulets are engaged in a blood feud.

In this death-filled setting, the movement from love at first sight to the lovers’ final union in death seems almost inevitable. And yet, this play set in an extraordinary world has become the quintessential story of young love. In part because of its exquisite language, it is easy to respond as if it were about all young lovers.

The authoritative edition of Romeo and Juliet from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:

*Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play
*Newly revised explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play
*Scene-by-scene plot summaries
*A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases
*An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language
*An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play
*Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books
*An up-to-date annotated guide to further reading",Romeo and Juliet,William Shakespeare, , ,Simon & Schuster,9780743477116,"1st Edition,2004",354,India,English

In covey's experience, the thing that most undermines the ability to execute goals is what he calls the whirlwind Those urgent tasks that must be done simply to keep an organization alive. As covey shows, the only way to execute new, important goals is to separate those goals from the whirlwind.

The four disciplines allow leaders to create a strategy that requires a change in behavior, since only by ensuring that everyone on the team understands the goal, knows what to do to reach it and knows whether progress is being made, will a leader produce consistent breakthrough results while sustaining the urgent work of the whirl wind. The four disciplines of execution are

    1. Focus on the wildly important
    2. Act on the lead measures
    3. Keep a compelling scoreboard
    4. Create a cadence of accountability.


For more than a decade Franklin covey has been studying what it takes to achieve important goals and in this book they share success stories from a wide range of companies that have implemented the four disciplines to result in greater profits, increased market share and improved customer satisfaction.

Born 1706 in Boston, Benjamin Franklin was the 15th of his father's 17 children. He went to school as a child with the intent of becoming a minister, as his father, Josiah, intended. However, that idea was dropped after Franklin showed a keen interest in reading and writing. He was apprenticed to his brother, James at a young age, but after fighting with his brother he quit the job and moved to Philadelphia, where he worked for a man named Samuel Keimer. After befriending some prominent political figures, including the royal Governor, Franklin left for England, where he spent 18 months working for a printer with his friend James Ralph, with whom he later became estranged. Shortly after returning to America in 1726, Franklin formed a debating club called the Junto. Two years later, he took over The Pennsylvania Gazette from Keimer and turned it into a successful publication with tools from London. In 1730, Franklin wed his old sweetheart, Deborah Read, with whom he had two children. The first, William Franklin, was born approximately one year later; he is the man to whom the Autobiography is addressed in Part One.

Throughout the 1730s, Franklin held some minor positions doing printing work for the government. In that time, he began Poor Richard's Almanac and became postmaster of Philadelphia. Towards the end of the decade, he invented the Franklin stove. In the 1740s, Franklin worked on several projects, including the fire brigade, the police force, the University of Pennsylvania, the street sweeping service and some other smaller public works projects. He retired from the printing business in 1748 and began to conduct scientific experiments in lightning. In 1753, he was awarded honorary degrees from Harvard and Yale, and he became Postmaster General of America. The following year, when war broke out between England and France (the French and Indian War Franklin began to draft proposals outlining means by which funds could be raised for colonial defense. He succeeded in many of his proposals, and he personally played a large part in organizing the war effort. The Autobiography, however, breaks off in 1757; it is left unfinished.

The Autobiography itself was written in three different times: 1771 in England, 1783-83 in France, and 1788 in America. If Franklin meant to complete it, he died before he got the chance.

Flap Of The Book:
The Private Life of Benjamin Franklin, Written by Himself, became the most popular
ever written. Franklin would have expected no less. It would have given him endless pleasure and delight. He wrote to
be read, by everyone ... He wanted his dear reader - you, dear reader – to reach out, pull that book down - pull this book down - press it open, and read within it the story of his life. But he knew, too, that to pull Franklin down from a shelf and
turn to the first page of the book of his life is to open him up the way the gowned anatomist plunges into a pale and waxen corpse: with a sharp knife.'",The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin ,Benjamin Franklin, , ,Simon & Schuster,9780743255066,"1st Edition,2004",143,India,English

But what if there was a way to teach children how to manage priorities, focus on goals and be a positive influence on the world around them?

The Leader in Me is that programme. It's based on a hugely successful initiative carried out at the A.B. Combs Elementary School in North Carolina. To hear the parents of A. B Combs talk about the school is to be amazed. In 1999, the school debuted a programme that taught The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to a pilot group of students. The parents reported an incredible change in their children, who blossomed under the programme. By the end of the following year the average end-of-grade scores had leapt from 84 to 94.

This book will launch the message onto a much larger platform. Stephen R. Covey takes the 7 Habits, that have already changed the lives of millions of people, and shows how children can use them as they develop. Those habits -- be proactive, begin with the end in mind, put first things first, think win-win, seek to understand and then to be understood, synergize, and sharpen the saw -- are critical skills to learn at a young age and bring incredible results, proving that it's never too early to teach someone how to live well.

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, first published in 1989, is a business and self-help book written by Stephen Covey. Covey presents an approach to being effective in attaining goals by aligning oneself to what he calls ""true north"" principles based on a character ethic that he presents as universal and timeless.

Covey defines effectiveness as the balance of obtaining desirable results with caring for that which produces those results. He illustrates this by referring to the fable of the goose that laid the golden eggs. He further claims that effectiveness can be expressed in terms of the P/PC ratio, where P refers to getting desired results and PC is caring for that which produces the results.

Covey's best-known book, it has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide since its first publication. The audio version became the first non-fiction audio-book in U.S. publishing history to sell more than one million copies. Covey argues against what he calls ""the personality ethic"", that he sees as prevalent in many modern self-help books. He promotes what he labels ""the character ethic"": aligning one's values with so-called universal and timeless principles. In doing this, Covey is deliberately and mindfully separating principles and values. He sees principles as external natural laws, while values remain internal and subjective. Our values govern our behavior, while principles ultimately determine the consequences. Covey presents his teachings in a series of habits, manifesting as a progression from dependence through independence on to interdependence.",The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People,Stephen R.

In any conflict, it is usually believed that there are two alternatives – the first being the personal alternative and the second being the other person’s alternative. It always comes down to an argument as to whose way is better among the two. But Stephen, in this book, attempts to introduce readers to a third alternative, which draws the best from both sides of a debate and ignore the negatives from both the parties. It helps in the emergence of a whole new place from a mere debate, where everyone is a winner and the conflict is also resolved. The 3rd Alternative signifies a completely new way of thinking that will be incorporated not only by his ardent fans, but also by anyone who seeks resolution in their professional and private lives.

The author became famous with her book and film, The Secret. In that book she explained the Law of Attraction and the power of positive thinking. This third book shows how expressing gratitude for everything one has will attract more good things into their lives.

The author says she received inspiration for The Magic from a sacred text, The Gospel of Matthew. Rhonda Byrnes says a person who is thankful for all the good things in their life will attract more of those good things. Those who do not express thanks for their blessings will end up losing what they have.

Expressing gratitude is a good positive practice that makes the person recall all the good things they have in their life, instead of focusing just on the negatives. This in turn can foster positive attitudes and make the person more constructive and upbeat in their life.

The Magic takes the reader on almost a month long journey. It has an action plan for 28 days, that helps them incorporate the concept of gratitude into their life. It shows them through a single exercise each day, how to express gratitude for past and present blessings and how to invite good things in the future through the act of expressing thankfulness.

Most people, in the rush and tension of the modern day lifestyle, tend to forget the great things that they have been blessed with, things like a good family, good health and so on. They instead obsess over the negatives and this makes them negative in their attitudes and actions too.

Fostering a sense of gratitude can make people more cheerful and positive by reminding them of the good aspects of their lives. The Magic is thus a manual for improving one’s viewpoints and directions in life.

In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare creates a violent world, in which two young people fall in love. It is not simply that their families disapprove; the Montagues and the Capulets are engaged in a blood feud.

In this death-filled setting, the movement from love at first sight to the lovers’ final union in death seems almost inevitable. And yet, this play set in an extraordinary world has become the quintessential story of young love. In part because of its exquisite language, it is easy to respond as if it were about all young lovers.

The authoritative edition of Romeo and Juliet from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:

*Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play
*Newly revised explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play
*Scene-by-scene plot summaries
*A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases
*An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language
*An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play
*Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books
*An up-to-date annotated guide to further reading",Romeo and Juliet,William Shakespeare, , ,Simon & Schuster,9780743477116,"1st Edition,2004",354,India,English

In covey's experience, the thing that most undermines the ability to execute goals is what he calls the whirlwind Those urgent tasks that must be done simply to keep an organization alive. As covey shows, the only way to execute new, important goals is to separate those goals from the whirlwind.

The four disciplines allow leaders to create a strategy that requires a change in behavior, since only by ensuring that everyone on the team understands the goal, knows what to do to reach it and knows whether progress is being made, will a leader produce consistent breakthrough results while sustaining the urgent work of the whirl wind. The four disciplines of execution are

    1. Focus on the wildly important
    2. Act on the lead measures
    3. Keep a compelling scoreboard
    4. Create a cadence of accountability.


For more than a decade Franklin covey has been studying what it takes to achieve important goals and in this book they share success stories from a wide range of companies that have implemented the four disciplines to result in greater profits, increased market share and improved customer satisfaction. This way of thinking is essential to any company that wants to not only whether, but thrive in this economy.",The 4 Disciplines Of Execution,Jim Huling, , ,Simon & Schuster,9781471142086,"1st,2014",368,India,English

Born 1706 in Boston, Benjamin Franklin was the 15th of his father's 17 children. He went to school as a child with the intent of becoming a minister, as his father, Josiah, intended. However, that idea was dropped after Franklin showed a keen interest in reading and writing. He was apprenticed to his brother, James at a young age, but after fighting with his brother he quit the job and moved to Philadelphia, where he worked for a man named Samuel Keimer. After befriending some prominent political figures, including the royal Governor, Franklin left for England, where he spent 18 months working for a printer with his friend James Ralph, with whom he later became estranged. Shortly after returning to America in 1726, Franklin formed a debating club called the Junto. Two years later, he took over The Pennsylvania Gazette from Keimer and turned it into a successful publication with tools from London. In 1730, Franklin wed his old sweetheart, Deborah Read, with whom he had two children. The first, William Franklin, was born approximately one year later; he is the man to whom the Autobiography is addressed in Part One.

Throughout the 1730s, Franklin held some minor positions doing printing work for the government. In that time, he began Poor Richard's Almanac and became postmaster of Philadelphia. Towards the end of the decade, he invented the Franklin stove. In the 1740s, Franklin worked on several projects, including the fire brigade, the police force, the University of Pennsylvania, the street sweeping service and some other smaller public works projects. He retired from the printing business in 1748 and began to conduct scientific experiments in lightning. In 1753, he was awarded honorary degrees from Harvard and Yale, and he became Postmaster General of America. The following year, when war broke out between England and France (the French and Indian War Franklin began to draft proposals outlining means by which funds could be raised for colonial defense. He succeeded in many of his proposals, and he personally played a large part in organizing the war effort. The Autobiography, however, breaks off in 1757; it is left unfinished.

The Autobiography itself was written in three different times: 1771 in England, 1783-83 in France, and 1788 in America. If Franklin meant to complete it, he died before he got the chance.

Flap Of The Book:
The Private Life of Benjamin Franklin, Written by Himself, became the most popular
ever written. Franklin would have expected no less. It would have given him endless pleasure and delight. He wrote to
be read, by everyone ... He wanted his dear reader - you, dear reader – to reach out, pull that book down - pull this book down - press it open, and read within it the story of his life. But he knew, too, that to pull Franklin down from a shelf and
turn to the first page of the book of his life is to open him up the way the gowned anatomist plunges into a pale and waxen corpse: with a sharp knife.'",The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin ,Benjamin Franklin, , ,Simon & Schuster,9780743255066,"1st Edition,2004",143,India,English

But what if there was a way to teach children how to manage priorities, focus on goals and be a positive influence on the world around them?

The Leader in Me is that programme. It's based on a hugely successful initiative carried out at the A.B. Combs Elementary School in North Carolina. To hear the parents of A. B Combs talk about the school is to be amazed. In 1999, the school debuted a programme that taught The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to a pilot group of students. The parents reported an incredible change in their children, who blossomed under the programme. By the end of the following year the average end-of-grade scores had leapt from 84 to 94.

This book will launch the message onto a much larger platform. Stephen R. Covey takes the 7 Habits, that have already changed the lives of millions of people, and shows how children can use them as they develop. Those habits -- be proactive, begin with the end in mind, put first things first, think win-win, seek to understand and then to be understood, synergize, and sharpen the saw -- are critical skills to learn at a young age and bring incredible results, proving that it's never too early to teach someone how to live well.

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, first published in 1989, is a business and self-help book written by Stephen Covey. Covey presents an approach to being effective in attaining goals by aligning oneself to what he calls ""true north"" principles based on a character ethic that he presents as universal and timeless.

Covey defines effectiveness as the balance of obtaining desirable results with caring for that which produces those results. He illustrates this by referring to the fable of the goose that laid the golden eggs. He further claims that effectiveness can be expressed in terms of the P/PC ratio, where P refers to getting desired results and PC is caring for that which produces the results.

Covey's best-known book, it has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide since its first publication. The audio version became the first non-fiction audio-book in U.S. publishing history to sell more than one million copies. Covey argues against what he calls ""the personality ethic"", that he sees as prevalent in many modern self-help books. He promotes what he labels ""the character ethic"": aligning one's values with so-called universal and timeless principles. In doing this, Covey is deliberately and mindfully separating principles and values. He sees principles as external natural laws, while values remain internal and subjective. Our values govern our behavior, while principles ultimately determine the consequences. Covey presents his teachings in a series of habits, manifesting as a progression from dependence through independence on to interdependence.",The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People,Stephen R.

In any conflict, it is usually believed that there are two alternatives – the first being the personal alternative and the second being the other person’s alternative. It always comes down to an argument as to whose way is better among the two. But Stephen, in this book, attempts to introduce readers to a third alternative, which draws the best from both sides of a debate and ignore the negatives from both the parties. It helps in the emergence of a whole new place from a mere debate, where everyone is a winner and the conflict is also resolved. The 3rd Alternative signifies a completely new way of thinking that will be incorporated not only by his ardent fans, but also by anyone who seeks resolution in their professional and private lives.

The author became famous with her book and film, The Secret. In that book she explained the Law of Attraction and the power of positive thinking. This third book shows how expressing gratitude for everything one has will attract more good things into their lives.

The author says she received inspiration for The Magic from a sacred text, The Gospel of Matthew. Rhonda Byrnes says a person who is thankful for all the good things in their life will attract more of those good things. Those who do not express thanks for their blessings will end up losing what they have.

Expressing gratitude is a good positive practice that makes the person recall all the good things they have in their life, instead of focusing just on the negatives. This in turn can foster positive attitudes and make the person more constructive and upbeat in their life.

The Magic takes the reader on almost a month long journey. It has an action plan for 28 days, that helps them incorporate the concept of gratitude into their life. It shows them through a single exercise each day, how to express gratitude for past and present blessings and how to invite good things in the future through the act of expressing thankfulness.

Most people, in the rush and tension of the modern day lifestyle, tend to forget the great things that they have been blessed with, things like a good family, good health and so on. They instead obsess over the negatives and this makes them negative in their attitudes and actions too.

Fostering a sense of gratitude can make people more cheerful and positive by reminding them of the good aspects of their lives. The Magic is thus a manual for improving one’s viewpoints and directions in life.

In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare creates a violent world, in which two young people fall in love. It is not simply that their families disapprove; the Montagues and the Capulets are engaged in a blood feud.

In this death-filled setting, the movement from love at first sight to the lovers’ final union in death seems almost inevitable. And yet, this play set in an extraordinary world has become the quintessential story of young love. In part because of its exquisite language, it is easy to respond as if it were about all young lovers.

The authoritative edition of Romeo and Juliet from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:

*Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play
*Newly revised explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play
*Scene-by-scene plot summaries
*A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases
*An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language
*An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play
*Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books
*An up-to-date annotated guide to further reading",Romeo and Juliet,William Shakespeare, , ,Simon & Schuster,9780743477116,"1st Edition,2004",354,India,English

In covey's experience, the thing that most undermines the ability to execute goals is what he calls the whirlwind Those urgent tasks that must be done simply to keep an organization alive. As covey shows, the only way to execute new, important goals is to separate those goals from the whirlwind.

The four disciplines allow leaders to create a strategy that requires a change in behavior, since only by ensuring that everyone on the team understands the goal, knows what to do to reach it and knows whether progress is being made, will a leader produce consistent breakthrough results while sustaining the urgent work of the whirl wind. The four disciplines of execution are

    1. Focus on the wildly important
    2. Act on the lead measures
    3. Keep a compelling scoreboard
    4. Create a cadence of accountability.


For more than a decade Franklin covey has been studying what it takes to achieve important goals and in this book they share success stories from a wide range of companies that have implemented the four disciplines to result in greater profits, increased market share and improved customer satisfaction.

Born 1706 in Boston, Benjamin Franklin was the 15th of his father's 17 children. He went to school as a child with the intent of becoming a minister, as his father, Josiah, intended. However, that idea was dropped after Franklin showed a keen interest in reading and writing. He was apprenticed to his brother, James at a young age, but after fighting with his brother he quit the job and moved to Philadelphia, where he worked for a man named Samuel Keimer. After befriending some prominent political figures, including the royal Governor, Franklin left for England, where he spent 18 months working for a printer with his friend James Ralph, with whom he later became estranged. Shortly after returning to America in 1726, Franklin formed a debating club called the Junto. Two years later, he took over The Pennsylvania Gazette from Keimer and turned it into a successful publication with tools from London. In 1730, Franklin wed his old sweetheart, Deborah Read, with whom he had two children. The first, William Franklin, was born approximately one year later; he is the man to whom the Autobiography is addressed in Part One.

Throughout the 1730s, Franklin held some minor positions doing printing work for the government. In that time, he began Poor Richard's Almanac and became postmaster of Philadelphia. Towards the end of the decade, he invented the Franklin stove. In the 1740s, Franklin worked on several projects, including the fire brigade, the police force, the University of Pennsylvania, the street sweeping service and some other smaller public works projects. He retired from the printing business in 1748 and began to conduct scientific experiments in lightning. In 1753, he was awarded honorary degrees from Harvard and Yale, and he became Postmaster General of America. The following year, when war broke out between England and France (the French and Indian War Franklin began to draft proposals outlining means by which funds could be raised for colonial defense. He succeeded in many of his proposals, and he personally played a large part in organizing the war effort. The Autobiography, however, breaks off in 1757; it is left unfinished.

The Autobiography itself was written in three different times: 1771 in England, 1783-83 in France, and 1788 in America. If Franklin meant to complete it, he died before he got the chance.

Flap Of The Book:
The Private Life of Benjamin Franklin, Written by Himself, became the most popular
ever written. Franklin would have expected no less. It would have given him endless pleasure and delight. He wrote to
be read, by everyone ... He wanted his dear reader - you, dear reader – to reach out, pull that book down - pull this book down - press it open, and read within it the story of his life. But he knew, too, that to pull Franklin down from a shelf and
turn to the first page of the book of his life is to open him up the way the gowned anatomist plunges into a pale and waxen corpse: with a sharp knife.'",The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin ,Benjamin Franklin, , ,Simon & Schuster,9780743255066,"1st Edition,2004",143,India,English

But what if there was a way to teach children how to manage priorities, focus on goals and be a positive influence on the world around them?

The Leader in Me is that programme. It's based on a hugely successful initiative carried out at the A.B. Combs Elementary School in North Carolina. To hear the parents of A. B Combs talk about the school is to be amazed. In 1999, the school debuted a programme that taught The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to a pilot group of students. The parents reported an incredible change in their children, who blossomed under the programme. By the end of the following year the average end-of-grade scores had leapt from 84 to 94.

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, first published in 1989, is a business and self-help book written by Stephen Covey. Covey presents an approach to being effective in attaining goals by aligning oneself to what he calls ""true north"" principles based on a character ethic that he presents as universal and timeless.

Covey defines effectiveness as the balance of obtaining desirable results with caring for that which produces those results. He illustrates this by referring to the fable of the goose that laid the golden eggs. He further claims that effectiveness can be expressed in terms of the P/PC ratio, where P refers to getting desired results and PC is caring for that which produces the results.

Covey's best-known book, it has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide since its first publication. The audio version became the first non-fiction audio-book in U.S. publishing history to sell more than one million copies. Covey argues against what he calls ""the personality ethic"", that he sees as prevalent in many modern self-help books. He promotes what he labels ""the character ethic"": aligning one's values with so-called universal and timeless principles. In doing this, Covey is deliberately and mindfully separating principles and values. He sees principles as external natural laws, while values remain internal and subjective. Our values govern our behavior, while principles ultimately determine the consequences. Covey presents his teachings in a series of habits, manifesting as a progression from dependence through independence on to interdependence.",The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People,Stephen R.

In any conflict, it is usually believed that there are two alternatives – the first being the personal alternative and the second being the other person’s alternative. It always comes down to an argument as to whose way is better among the two. But Stephen, in this book, attempts to introduce readers to a third alternative, which draws the best from both sides of a debate and ignore the negatives from both the parties. It helps in the emergence of a whole new place from a mere debate, where everyone is a winner and the conflict is also resolved. The 3rd Alternative signifies a completely new way of thinking that will be incorporated not only by his ardent fans, but also by anyone who seeks resolution in their professional and private lives.

The author became famous with her book and film, The Secret. In that book she explained the Law of Attraction and the power of positive thinking. This third book shows how expressing gratitude for everything one has will attract more good things into their lives.

The author says she received inspiration for The Magic from a sacred text, The Gospel of Matthew. Rhonda Byrnes says a person who is thankful for all the good things in their life will attract more of those good things. Those who do not express thanks for their blessings will end up losing what they have.

Expressing gratitude is a good positive practice that makes the person recall all the good things they have in their life, instead of focusing just on the negatives. This in turn can foster positive attitudes and make the person more constructive and upbeat in their life.

The Magic takes the reader on almost a month long journey. It has an action plan for 28 days, that helps them incorporate the concept of gratitude into their life. It shows them through a single exercise each day, how to express gratitude for past and present blessings and how to invite good things in the future through the act of expressing thankfulness.

Most people, in the rush and tension of the modern day lifestyle, tend to forget the great things that they have been blessed with, things like a good family, good health and so on. They instead obsess over the negatives and this makes them negative in their attitudes and actions too.

Fostering a sense of gratitude can make people more cheerful and positive by reminding them of the good aspects of their lives. The Magic is thus a manual for improving one’s viewpoints and directions in life.

In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare creates a violent world, in which two young people fall in love. It is not simply that their families disapprove; the Montagues and the Capulets are engaged in a blood feud.

In this death-filled setting, the movement from love at first sight to the lovers’ final union in death seems almost inevitable. And yet, this play set in an extraordinary world has become the quintessential story of young love. In part because of its exquisite language, it is easy to respond as if it were about all young lovers.

The authoritative edition of Romeo and Juliet from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:

*Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play
*Newly revised explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play
*Scene-by-scene plot summaries
*A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases
*An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language
*An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play
*Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books
*An up-to-date annotated guide to further reading",Romeo and Juliet,William Shakespeare, , ,Simon & Schuster,9780743477116,"1st Edition,2004",354,India,English

In covey's experience, the thing that most undermines the ability to execute goals is what he calls the whirlwind Those urgent tasks that must be done simply to keep an organization alive. As covey shows, the only way to execute new, important goals is to separate those goals from the whirlwind.

The four disciplines allow leaders to create a strategy that requires a change in behavior, since only by ensuring that everyone on the team understands the goal, knows what to do to reach it and knows whether progress is being made, will a leader produce consistent breakthrough results while sustaining the urgent work of the whirl wind. The four disciplines of execution are

    1. Focus on the wildly important
    2. Act on the lead measures
    3. Keep a compelling scoreboard
    4. Create a cadence of accountability.


For more than a decade Franklin covey has been studying what it takes to achieve important goals and in this book they share success stories from a wide range of companies that have implemented the four disciplines to result in greater profits, increased market share and improved customer satisfaction. This way of thinking is essential to any company that wants to not only whether, but thrive in this economy.",The 4 Disciplines Of Execution,Jim Huling, , ,Simon & Schuster,9781471142086,"1st,2014",368,India,English
