Opportunistic pathogens in the immunocompromised and immunosuppressed, exotic food, and travel to tropical regions, have all increased the number and types of rare parasites now frequently seen in practice. Identifying these organisms can be challenging. To help accurately identify them and diagnose their related diseases, Parasites in Human Tissues provides complete microanatomic descriptions of more than 70 parasites that can appear in human tissue. More than 700 diagnostic and clinical images, almost 600 in full color, illustrate anatomic and morphologic details for each organism. Parasites in Human Tissues summarizes the biology and life histories of these organisms as well as their clinical presentation and pathology. Among the etiologic agents covered are protozoa, nematoda, trematoda, cestoda, acanthocephala, pseudoparasites, pentastoma, and arthropods. Pathologists, research scientists, and anyone working in clinical and diagnostic settings will find Parasites In Human Tissues a comprehensive and useful guide to this increasingly important issue.",Parasites in Human Tissues,Thomas C.
