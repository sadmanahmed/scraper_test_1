A theme of personal transcendence appears for both characters: Morrie and Albom. This transformation is experienced by both characters through Morrie's deteriorating health. Morrie shows us the value of retaining dignity in the face of death; that love is the most valuable thing we can offer to each other. For readers, this allows a casual avenue for learning about the dying process; learning ""that not all stories end happily with a person going into remission and thus avoiding death. Rather, dying and death are natural processes and need to be acknowledged for what they are—natural events."" The role that culture plays in the development of happiness within our lives is also examined within the novel. Morrie remarks that we often see ourselves as dissimilar to each other, rather than similar. He goes on to promote the value of investing in people rather than material objects.","Tuesdays With Morrie: An old man,a young man,and lifes greatest lesson",Mitch Albom, , ,Sphere,9780751527377,"Reprind,2009",210,United Kingdom,English

When a mysterious young woman named Katie appears in the small North Carolina town of Southport, her sudden arrival raises questions about her past. Beautiful yet self-effacing, Katie seems determined to avoid forming personal ties until a series of events draws her into two reluctant relationships: one with Alex, a widowed store owner with a kind heart and two young children; and another with her plainspoken single neighbor, Jo. Despite her reservations, Katie slowly begins to let down her guard, putting down roots in the close-knit community and becoming increasingly attached to Alex and his family.

But even as Katie begins to fall in love, she struggles with the dark secret that still haunts and terrifies her . . . a past that set her on a fearful, shattering journey across the country, to the sheltered oasis of Southport. With Jo's empathic and stubborn support, Katie eventually realizes that she must choose between a life of transient safety and one of riskier rewards . . . and that in the darkest hour, love is the only true safe haven.",Safe Haven,Nicholas Sparks, , ,Sphere,9780751549898,"Reprinted,2015",416,India,English

The Casual Vacancy occurs in the Parish Council when the popular Councillor Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly of an aneurism. The small village of Pagford is torn apart by petty jealousies and rivalries, and social and political ambitions.

The main issue driving the election campaign concerns the public housing community, The Fields. The high class citizens of the village want nothing to do with the council estate. They believe the inhabitants of The Fields to be an idle group, who live off the state and pass through addiction centers.

Barry Fairbrother had himself come from The Fields and shared a bond with the people there. He wanted to bring the council estate into the mainstream of the Parish Council and had been working on many programmes to help the people of The Field.

One of his favorite proteges was Krystal Weedon, the daughter of a heroin addict mother. He includes her in a rowing team at the school and tries in other ways to bring her of her tough shell and fit into the larger community. After Barry’s death, the undercurrent in the community rise to the surface. The online parish community becomes a hotbed for rumor and accusations as someone under the name The Ghost of Barry Fairbrother reveals secrets about those who are contesting for the council seat.

As secrets are revealed and hidden passions come to the surface, the contest over The Casual Vacancy peels off the idyllic veneer of the attractive village. The petty warring and factionalism in the village community affects many families and leads to tragedies and some final resolutions.

The village and the story are inhabited by complex characters. There is the doctor Parminder Jawanda, a caring member of the community. Yet, she’s not so understanding towards her underachieving youngest child, Sukhvinder, and drives her unmercifully. There is Fats Wall, the school bully who picks on Sukhvinder and harries her beyond endurance. But he too is troubled, as he was adopted and this fact affects his behavior to a great extent.

The Casual Vacancy is mostly a dark tale, peeling off facades to reveal the ugliness of human nature underneath. It also shows many of the characters redeeming themselves after a tragedy that affects the whole community.

Neither will be able to guess how closely linked they are to a shocking secret—one that will force them to question everything they ever believed in . . . and make a heartbreaking choice that will change their lives forever.
