A thirteen-year-old girl in Netherlands is given a diary for her birthday. Two days later she starts writing in it. It would have been the typical diary of a typical teenage girl, only it was the June of 1942, Adolf Hitler had launched his aggressive campaign against the Jews of continental Europe; his armies had taken over much of the continent already Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland falling one after the other like matchsticks-and when the Germans entered Netherlands, the little girl, also a Jew, went into hiding with her father Otto Frank, her mother Edith, sister Margot, and another family of three in a sealed-off room concealed behind a wooden bookcase in the upper annex of the building her father worked in, in Amsterdam. There she would remain in hiding with the others for two years until they would all be betrayed and then whisked away by soldiers of the occupying German forces to a concentration camp where she would ultimately die of typhus, a mere two weeks before she would have been liberated along with the others by British troops had she managed to pull herself through the illness, Anne Frank was fifteen years old when she died in that Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in the early days of March 1945, her short young life snuffed out tragically by the workings of a twisted manic ideology. 
Born in June 1929, Anne Frank would have probably led a life of obscurity had her diary not been published by her father in 1947. She would have remained a number, a faceless statistic lost in a government file supposedly documenting the human side of the Second World War. But, it was not to be so. Though she had started writing in her diary in the summer of 1942, it had never been with the intention of creating a record of her experiences as a Jew in hiding Anne's diary was, for her, a space to express herself in the most honest and candid of terms. She shied away from writing nothing, revealing all and baring her very soul on the pages of the diary. However, in March 1944, Anne heard a radio broadcast by a member of the Dutch government in exile in London who spoke of wanting to create a public archive of the Dutch people's experiences of oppression under the German regime. He asked the people to save all their letters, their diaries, journals, and photographs for they would all prove invaluable to his project. Inspired, Anne began editing her journal with the intention of submitting it for publication once the war was over. She worked her way through two years of writing, always staying true to what she had seen and been through, to what she had written. 
Today, Anne Frank's diary is one of the most important documents to have survived Hitler's madness. Official records and political discourses aside, it is through the victim and the survivor's voices alone that a human story can be woven out of historical tragedies, and Anne's diary does just this. She was thirteen years old when she started writing. She had nothing to prove, no hidden agendas to achieve, no propaganda to spread. She wrote simply because she wanted to. She wrote with the great innocence and sincerity that only children can possess, but what she wrote was not as innocent as she herself was, Amidst all the controversies and debates that have surrounded the Holocaust, Anne's diary, one of the most meticulously-maintained and revealing of documents to come from the victims' side, has become a symbolic text of the Holocaust. Children read abridged versions of the diary as a part of their academic curriculum to acquaint themselves of what a girl their age faced during a particularly terrible time in the 1940s. Academicians and historians revolve works of great merit around it, using it as an authentic source point of historical truth. Of the diary itself, Dutch journalist and historian Jan Romein said in 1946, that although 'stammered out in a child's voice, it 'embodies all the hideousness of fascism, more so than all the evidence at Nuremberg put together 
Anne's voice has reached out across continents and generations. Her diary has kept the victims of Holocaust from slipping into an otherwise inevitable anonymity. She has given others like her a face and a life. She has made it real for all those who lived through it and for those who came after her, like us. It is said that the wound the psyche of

Anne Frank's diary needs no introduction.
This Beautifully Written memoir of a young girl Caught in the middle of one of the most horrific periods of human history
 is a testament to the indestructible human will to persevere and Survive in the face of the most adverse of Circumstances. Where Anne Frank herself became One of the Victims Of the Second World War, her words, crowding every available inch of space in her diary,

																																																															Summary of the Book

The best of times, the worst of times, the age of wisdom, the age of foolishness, the epoch of belief, the epoch of incredulity, the season of Light, the season of Darkness, the spring of hope, the winter of despair, having everything, yet nothing, leading to heaven, yet leading to the other way, the time of the French Revolution was all this and more. In this setting Dickens begins his most famous work, telling the story of the French peasantry demoralised by the French aristocracy in the years leading up to the revolution. Principally the story of Sidney Carton and Lucie Manette, this book follows them and the villainous Madame Defarge to tell a story of darkness, love, forgiveness, revenge and self-sacrifice.

The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Late Spring and Autumn Period (roughly 5th century BC). The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (""Master Sun"", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to an aspect of warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare[1] and has influenced both Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy and beyond.

This book contained a detailed explanation and analysis of the Chinese military, from weapons and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun Tzu also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Because Sun Tzu has long been considered to be one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training for centuries to come.
Chapter summary
1. Detail assessment and planning: explores the five fundamental factors (the Way, seasons, terrain, leadership, and management) and seven elements that determine the outcomes of military engagements. By thinking, assessing and comparing these points, a commander can calculate his chances of victory. Habitual deviation from these calculations will ensure failure via improper action. The text stresses that war is a very grave matter for the state and must not be commenced without due consideration.
2. Waging war : explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how success requires winning decisive engagements quickly. This section advises that successful military campaigns require limiting the cost of competition and conflict.
3. Strategic attack : defines the source of strength as unity, not size, and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war. In order of importance, these critical factors are: Attack, Strategy, Alliances, Army and Cities.
4. Disposition of the army : explains the importance of defending existing positions until a commander is capable of advancing from those positions in safety. It teaches commanders the importance of recognizing strategic opportunities, and teaches not to create opportunities for the enemy.
5. Forces : explains the use of creativity and timing in building an army's momentum.
6. Weaknesses and strengths : explains how an army's opportunities come from the openings in the environment caused by the relative weakness of the enemy and how to respond to changes in the fluid battlefield over a given area.
7. Military maneuvers : explains the dangers of direct conflict and how to win those confrontations when they are forced upon the commander.
8. Variations and adaptability : focuses on the need for flexibility in an army's responses. It explains how to respond to shifting circumstances successfully.
9. Movement and development of troops : describes the different situations in which an army finds itself as it moves through new enemy territories, and how to respond to these situations. Much of this section focuses on evaluating the intentions of others.
10. Terrain : looks at the three general areas of resistance (distance, dangers and barriers) and the six types of ground positions that arise from them. Each of these six field positions offers certain advantages and disadvantages.
11. The nine battlegrounds : describes the nine common situations (or stages) in a campaign, from scattering to deadly, and the specific focus that a commander will need in order to successfully navigate them.
12. Attacking with fire : explains the general use of weapons and the specific use of the environment as a weapon. This section examines the five targets for attack, the five types of environmental attack and the appropriate responses to such attacks.

George Orwell, born Eric Arthur Blair, was a much-respected English novelist, political author, and journalist who wrote some of the finest pieces in literary criticism, poetry, fiction, and polemical journalism. Born on June 25, 1903 in Bihar, India, to a Civil Servant who worked in the then legal opium trade, Orwell moved to London with his mother and elder sister at the age of one. He started his schooling at St Cyprian's, which he referred to as ""a lukewarm bath of snobbery', and later won a scholarship to Eton, but didn't perform well there, perhaps by choice. Having no other option left, he signed up for the Indian Imperial Police and left for Burma (modern-day Myanmar) in 1922. Having grown to hate imperialism and keen to start a fresh career with writing, Orwell returned home in 1927 and moved to Paris. During his years in Paris, he wrote numerous short stories and articles, but he didn't achieve much success with either. He came back to London after he fell seriously ill, and it was here that he wrote under the pseudonym George Orwell for the first time. His first work under this pen-name was Down and Out in Paris and London, a memoir-cum-travelogue themed on poverty in the two capital cities. Considered perhaps the twentieth century's best chronicler of English culture, Orwell's work is known for its simplicity, astuteness, and wit. His writing is mainly within the genres of dystopia and satire, and he wrote with great cleverness on subjects such as anti-fascism, democratic socialism, totalitarianism, and the anti-Stalinist left. He used his fiction writing, as well as his journalism, to defend his political convictions. Orwell's work continues to feed popular and political culture. Many of the words coined by him, such as 'doublethink', 'thought crime', 'Big Brother, and 'thought police', have found a place in popular jargon today.
His best works include Animal Farm, Nineteen Eighty Four, and Homage to Catalonia (which is inspired by his stint in the Spanish Civil War). George Orwell died at the age of forty-six in 1950.

PREFACE
A polemic text, George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty Four is a bold voice that cries out against the cacophony of fascist, communist, and other totalitarian forms of governance. Considered a self-contained critique of the totalitarian state, this Orwellian masterpiece has given the modern world much of its popular political jargon. 
Set in Oceania, one of the three intercontinental super states that divided the world among themselves after a global atomic war, the story unfolds in London, the chief city of Airstrip One, governed by the Party headed by the Big Brother. Posters screaming BIG BROTHER IS WATCHINGYOU” clutter every inch of available public and private space in the city. Every street corner, every lamp post, and every wall has life-size pictures of Big Brother's face, his eyes following the wary citizens as they walk past it.
When the book opens, it is a bright cold day in April, the clocks are 'striking thirteen, and the protagonist, Winston Smith, is in the clutches of a dystopian future. The world as we know it has been obliterated by a global atomic war. Those who have survived it are living in what are the ruins of an England already ravaged by World War II, civil conflict, and the political revolution which brought the Party to power. Winston Smith is a member of the Outer Party which consists, almost entirely, of the middle class. He works for Minitrue, the Ministry of Truth, where he is an editor responsible for changing and doctoring the past, day in and day out, to match the Party's ever-changing official version, intended to make the state an omniscient entity. This perpetual engagement with state-sponsored rewriting of history inspires within Winston a dangerous fascination for the true past, and he tries, discreetly, and against the state diktat, to unearth as much of the truth as he can. 
In a world where thought crime is death, where a fascination with the true past is an offense punishable by death, Winston starts maintaining a journal criticizing the Party and Big Brother, its enigmatic leader. He writes sitting at his desk in an alcove in his flat, at an angle that hides him from the intrusive eyes of the telescreen, a privacy that is as much a rebellion as it is a rarity, And then one day, in the middle of his daily work and private rebellion, he meets Julia, a young dark-haired mechanic who repairs the Minitrue novel-writing machines. From here begins Winston's fall into an abyss which takes both Julia and him them through love, painful confessions, betrayals and much more. 
What George Orwell did in Nineteen Eighty Four was not only ahead of its times, but it was revolutionary as well. And revolutionary in more than one sense. While it commented upon the times to come in a rather ominous prophetic manner-newscasters even today talk about an Orwellian present/future-the text also shed light upon the conditions that defined much of the world when Orwell actually set about writing it. Orwell touched upon a raw nerve as he shaped Winston Smith, giving a voice and a face to all the popular fears and nightmares that were running in everyone's heads about the rot that had set in in the social and political structures of the day. 
Can Nineteen Eighty Four, then, be considered to be a prophecy? A prophecy of sorts, perhaps, yes. The text did touch upon problem points that were, then, yet to come, and which, now, are very much a part of the present. It was a warning ahead of its times, a cautionary piece of writing about human freedom being on the verge of enslavement by the chains of political organization and technology, about how power, once acquired, needs absolute sacrifice for the sake of those seeking it and maintaining it. 
While Nineteen Eighty Four is often hailed as an excellent piece of modern science fiction literature dealing with dystopian futures, it is also at once a commentary on the ideas of revolution, war, totalitarianism, nationalism, and political geographies. It grapples, at the same time, with such issues as living standards and extreme censorship, 
Most of the original novel was written in Jura between 1947 to 1948. During this time, George Orwell himself was seriously ill, suffering from tuberculosis. The book was finally sent to the publisher on the 4"" of December, 1948 and published on the 8"" of June the following year.

Pride and Prejudice is set in rural England in the early 19th century, and it follows the Bennet family, which includes five very different sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious to see all her daughters married, especially as the modest family estate is to be inherited by William Collins when Mr. Bennet dies. At a ball, the wealthy and newly arrived Charles Bingley takes an immediate interest in the eldest Bennet daughter, the beautiful and shy Jane. The encounter between his friend Darcy and Elizabeth is less cordial. Although Austen shows them intrigued by each other, she reverses the convention of first impressions: pride of rank and fortune and prejudice against the social inferiority of Elizabeth’s family hold Darcy aloof, while Elizabeth is equally fired both by the pride of self-respect and by prejudice against Darcy’s snobbery.

The pompous Collins subsequently arrives, hoping to marry one of the Bennet sisters. Elizabeth, however, refuses his offer of marriage, and he instead becomes engaged to her friend Charlotte Lucas. During this time, Elizabeth encounters the charming George Wickham, a military officer. There is a mutual attraction between the two, and he informs her that Darcy has denied him his inheritance.

After Bingley abruptly departs for London, Elizabeth’s dislike of Darcy increases as she becomes convinced that he is discouraging Bingley’s relationship with Jane. Darcy, however, has grown increasingly fond of Elizabeth, admiring her intelligence and vitality. While visiting the now-married Charlotte, Elizabeth sees Darcy, who professes his love for her and proposes. A surprised Elizabeth refuses his offer, and, when Darcy demands an explanation, she accuses him of breaking up Jane and Bingley. Darcy subsequently writes Elizabeth a letter in which he explains that he separated the couple largely because he did not believe Jane returned Bingley’s affection. He also discloses that Wickham, after squandering his inheritance, tried to marry Darcy’s then 15-year-old sister in an attempt to gain possession of her fortune. With these revelations, Elizabeth begins to see Darcy in a new light.

Shortly thereafter the youngest Bennet sister, Lydia, elopes with Wickham. The news is met with great alarm by Elizabeth, since the scandalous affair—which is unlikely to end in marriage—could ruin the reputation of the other Bennet sisters. When she tells Darcy, he persuades Wickham to marry Lydia, offering him money. Despite Darcy’s attempt to keep his intervention a secret, Elizabeth learns of his actions. At the encouragement of Darcy, Bingley subsequently returns, and he and Jane become engaged. Finally, Darcy proposes again to Elizabeth, who this time accepts.",Pride and  Prejudice,Jane Austen, , ,Fingerprint Publishing,9788172344504,"1st Edition,2016",407,India,English

Although it had a tortuous publication history after Franklin's death, this work has become one of the most famous and influential examples of an autobiography ever written. Franklin was a statesman, author, inventor, printer, and scientist. 
Part One of The Autobiography is addressed to Franklin's son William, at that time (1771) Royal Governor of New Jersey. While in England at the estate of the Bishop of St Asaph in Twyford, Franklin, now 65 years old, begins by saying that it may be agreeable to his son to know some of the incidents of his father's life; so with a week's uninterrupted leisure, he is beginning to write them down for William. He starts with some anecdotes of his grandfather, uncles, father and mother. He deals with his childhood, his fondness for reading, and his service as an apprentice to his brother James Franklin, a Boston printer and the publisher of the New England Courant. After improving his writing skills through study of the Spectator by Joseph Addison and Sir Richard Steele, he writes an anonymous paper and slips it under the door of the printing house by night. Not knowing its author, James and his friends praise the paper and it is published in the Courant, which encourages Ben to produce more essays (the ""Silence Dogood"" essays) which are also published. When Ben reveals his authorship, James is angered, thinking the recognition of his papers will make Ben too vain. James and Ben have frequent disputes and Ben seeks for a way to escape from working under James. 
The second part begins with two letters Franklin received in the early 1780s while in Paris, encouraging him to continue the Autobiography, of which both correspondents have read Part One. (Although Franklin does not say so, there had been a breach with his son William after the writing of Part One, since the father had sided with the Revolutionaries and the son had remained loyal to the British Crown. 
Beginning in August 1788 when Franklin had returned to Philadelphia, the author says he will not be able to utilize his papers as much as he had expected, since many were lost in the recent Revolutionary War. He has, however, found and quotes a couple of his writings from the 1730s that survived. One is the ""Substance of an intended Creed"" consisting of what he then considered to be the ""Essentials"" of all religions. He had intended this as a basis for a projected sect but, Franklin says, did not pursue the project.

The Little Prince first published in April 1943, is a novella, the most famous work of French aristocrat, writer, poet, and pioneering aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.

The novella is one of the most-translated books in the world and has been voted the best book of the 20th century in France. Translated into 300 languages and dialects, selling nearly two million copies annually, and with year-to-date sales of over 140 million copies worldwide, it has become one of the best-selling books ever published.

After the outbreak of the Second World War, Saint-Exupéry escaped to North America. Despite personal upheavals and failing health, he produced almost half of the writings for which he would be remembered, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss, in the form of a young prince visiting Earth.

Anna Karenina is the tragic story of Countess Anna Karenina, a married noblewoman and socialite, and her affair with the affluent Count Vronsky. The story starts when she arrives in the midst of a family broken up by her brother's unbridled womanizing—something that prefigures her own later situation, though she would experience less tolerance by others.

A bachelor, Vronsky is eager to marry Anna if she will agree to leave her husband Count Karenin, a senior government official, but she is vulnerable to the pressures of Russian social norms, the moral laws of the Russian Orthodox Church, her own insecurities, and Karenin's indecision. Although Vronsky and Anna go to Italy, where they can be together, they have trouble making friends. Back in Russia, she is shunned, becoming further isolated and anxious, while Vronsky pursues his social life. Despite Vronsky's reassurances, she grows increasingly possessive and paranoid about his imagined infidelity, fearing loss of control.

A parallel story within the novel is that of Konstantin Lëvin or Ljovin, a wealthy country landowner who wants to marry Princess Kitty, sister to Princess Dolly and sister-in-law to Anna's brother Prince Oblonsky. Konstantin has to propose twice before Kitty accepts. The novel details Konstantin's difficulties managing his estate, his eventual marriage, and his struggle to accept the Christian faith, until the birth of his first child.

The novel explores a diverse range of topics throughout its approximately one thousand pages. Some of these topics include an evaluation of the feudal system that existed in Russia at the time—politics, not only in the Russian government but also at the level of the individual characters and families, religion, morality, gender and social class.",Anna Karenina,Leo Tolstoy, , ,Fingerprint Publishing,9788175993426,"1st Edition,2016",760,India,English

The Jungle Book is seven mostly unrelated short stories—some not even in the jungle—and seven short works of verse related to the story.

The first set of three stories stars a young boy named Mowgli. He is raised by wolves, trained by a bear, kidnapped by monkeys, rescued by a panther and a snake, and kills and skins a tiger. All this before he hits puberty.

In ""The White Seal,"" Kotick, the titular white seal, who lives in the Bering Sea (which is not the jungle), sees his adorable, cute, cuddly, fuzzy seal buddies get clubbed to death and their bloody skins ripped from their little bodies. Yikes. He decides to search for an island where all seals can be safe, but when he finds it, all the seals are too lazy to move. Talk about ungrateful, right? Kotick, who's all big and strong from all the swimming, kicks all the seals' tails. Impressed by his strength, they follow him to safety.

Our protagonist in ""Toomai of the Elephants"" is Toomai (of the elephants). He follows his elephant Kala Nag into the jungle and witnesses a top-secret elephant dance ritual.

Finally, there's ""Our Majesty's Servants,"" in which a bunch of military service animals—donkeys, camels, and horses, oh my—chat about fear and obedience.

The Prince of Denmark, Hamlet is in Germany in pursuit of education. Suddenly he is called to Denmark to attain the funeral of his father. When he comes home, he is shocked to see his mother Gertrude already to his uncle, Claudius and he himself has declared the king. Claudius has neglected the fact that the rightful heir to the throne is Prince Hamlet. After observing the situation, Hamlet smells a rat and doubts his uncle.
One night, the ghost of his father visits Prince Hamlet and tells him that he was murdered by his uncle Claudius when he was in sleep. He further says that he was poured poison in his ears while in deep sleep. The ghost entrusts Hamlet with a work of revenge the murderer Claudius and leave Gertrude in the hand of Heaven.

Hamlet plans to put on the fake mask of madness in the castle so as to observe the interaction and get to the truth. But he discovers himself in the great confusion and bewilderment. As he is a philosophical Prince, he keeps on thinking and raises the existence of the ghost and its truth. His behavior is changed because of his confusion and becomes moody. He thinks of staging a play putting the same murder scene that the ghost has described to him. He adds the scene of the murder, calling it The Mousetrap, in the middle of the play The Murder of Gonzago. He had expected that if the ghost is right, then it scene would work on the king and he would certainly show some odd behavior. As expected, the king could not breathe and wants the light, so he leaves the room. Now, Hamlet is fully convinced that he is the real killer of his father. He vows to kill him, but the problem with him is that he is too conscious and thinks a lot. His thought and philosophy immobilize him.

His passive and reluctant act of taking revenge takes the lives of six innocent people. When Hamlet and the queen are in the private chamber, Polonius spies on them. Hamlet discovers this fact and stabs him. Hamlet is punished for killing Polonius and he is sent to England. There he is spied by his school friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. When he knows about this, he arranges the hanging of these two friends instead. When Ophelia, whom Hamlet loves, comes to know that Hamlet has killed her father Polonius, she becomes mad and dies singing sad songs. Laertes, her brother comes from France, witnesses the death of his father and sister, gets angry on Hamlet and both fight. Laertes has a poisoned sword with which he cuts Hamlet and Hamlet too gets the same poisoned sword and kills Laertes. Meanwhile, Hamlets gets the message that his mother dies eating the toast form the poisoned bowl that is intended for Hamlet by Claudius.

For sheer storytelling delight and pure adventure, Treasure Island has never been surpassed. From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle, the nevel creates scenes and characters that have firetd the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist, a master of both action and atmosphere, the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil. It is the villainy of that most ambiguous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery, greed, and daring. Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons, Treasure Island is, in the words of G. K. Chesterton, 'the realization of an ideal, that which is promised in its provocative and beckoning map; a vision not only of white skeletons but also green palm trees and sapphire seas.' G. S.

The play opens with Macbeth and Banquo, two of the Scottish King Duncan’s generals returning from battle when they encounter three witches in the woods. The witches tell Macbeth of how he will become the Thane of Cawdor and then the King of Scotland. For Banquo, they prophesize that he will beget the line of Scottish Kings, though he will never become king himself. The two are sufficiently skeptical and continue their journey home.
However, when the two come closer to the encampment, they are presented with a messenger from King Duncan who announces that Macbeth has been made the Thane of Cawdor, immediately putting the prophecy into perspective, making Macbeth wonder how he might become king. He invites Duncan to dine at his castle that evening and goes ahead to tell his wife of the day’s events.
Unlike Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is very sure of her husband’s future, desiring the throne and telling him that they must murder Duncan to ensure his ascension. Immediately upon returning to his castle, Lady Macbeth is able to convince her husband to take initiative and murder Duncan that very night.
The two plan to get Duncan’s chamberlains drunk enough that they will not remember the evening and blame them for the murder. When the body of Duncan is discovered in the morning, Macbeth quickly kills the “culprits” and assumes the kingship. All the while, Duncan’s sons flee the country, afraid for their own lives. 
Immediately, Macbeth’s misgivings and trust in the prophecies force his hand in the murder of Banquo and his son Fleance as well, afraid that his heirs will seize the throne. Successfully killing Banquo, the murderers fail to kill Fleance. 
The night of his murder, Banquo’s ghost appears to Macbeth and sends him into hysteria, scaring his guests and angering his wife. His very presence as the king of Scotland has angered the other nobles and further incites Macbeth’s misgivings and paranoia. 
To ease his fears, he visits the witches again and they offer to him more prophecies. He must beware of Macduff, a chief opponent to Macbeth taking the throne. He cannot be harmed by any man born of woman and he is safe until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane Castle. He returns home and finds that Macduff has fled to England to join Malcom. In fear, Macbeth seizes Macduff’s castle and orders the murder of his wife and children, inciting Macduff to further rage. With Malcom, the two raise an army and ride to Scotland to take on Macbeth with the support of the Scottish nobles who fear Macbeth’s tyranny and murderous ways.
While Macbeth awaits his opponents, Lady Macbeth is in the process of going mad, unable to wash the blood from her hands. The news of her suicide reaches Macbeth directly before the arrival of the English forces and sends him into an even deeper despair. He awaits confidently as the prophecy foretold his invulnerability. However, Macduff’s forces arrive under the cover of boughs cut from Birnam wood. When Macbeth is finally confronted by Macduff after his forces have been overwhelmed, Macduff announces that he was “ripped from his mother’s womb” not born and ultimately defeats and beheads Macbeth, handing the crown back to Malcolm, the rightful heir.

War And Peace is a classic novel that delves into the dual themes of war and love. The book was first published in 1869 and is widely considered as Leo Tolstoy’s magnum opus. 

Summary Of The Book:

Originally written in Russian, War And Peace has been translated into a number of languages, including English. The novel, though one of the longest ever written, is a must read for every literature enthusiast. The novel is set in the early 19th century and revolves around the French invasion of Russia by Napoleon. War And Peace is truly an epic in itself and is divided into four volumes and has an epilogue in two parts. Most of the characters of the large cast are introduced early, at a social party in St. Petersburg. While the novel is fictional in nature, it does include some historical facts and figures, such as Alexander I and Napoleon, and the French Invasion of Russia in 1812 and the Napoleonic Wars. The novel takes us on an unforgettable journey as we encounter various characters in search of love amidst war and peace. The novel’s plot can be seen from two different perspectives. First, it depicts the Napoleonic invasion of Russia, and the Russian war efforts to defeat the French. The other plot is mainly concerned with the personal dramas of five aristocratic families, particularly the Bolkonskys, the Bezukhovs, and the Rostovs. The novel follows these representatives of the Russian aristocracy, as they build their lives in a war torn empire. The principal characters of the novel are three young aristocrats, Pierre, Andrei and Natasha. While the novel focuses on the aristocracy, the peasantry and the soldiers are given ample voice throughout. War And Peace is not just a novel about human emotions, frailties and history, but it is also a discourse on Tolstoy’s philosophies. The later part of the novel includes many sections that throw light on Tolstoy’s philosophical ideologies.

Mark Twain blends many comic elements into the story of Huck Finn, a boy about 13 years old, living in pre-Civil War Missouri. Huck, the novel’s narrator, has been living with the Widow Douglas and her sister, Miss Watson, in the town of St. Petersburg. They have been trying to “sivilize” him with proper dress, manners, and religious piety. He finds this life constraining and false and would rather live free and wild. When his father hears that Huck has come into a large amount of money, he kidnaps him and locks him in an old cabin across the river. To avoid his father’s cruel beatings, Huck elaborately stages his own death and then escapes to Jackson’s Island. He finds Jim, Miss Watson’s runaway slave, on the island, and the two decide to hide out together. To avoid danger of discovery, they decide to float down the river on a raft they had found earlier. Sleeping during the day and traveling at night, they plan to connect with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois, which would lead them north into the free states, where slavery is outlawed. They miss Cairo in the fog one night and find themselves floating deeper into slave territory. While they are searching for a canoe, a steamship hits the raft and damages it. Huck and Jim are separated.

Huck swims ashore where he meets the feuding Grangerfords and Shepherdsons. He claims to be George Jackson, a passenger who fell from a steamboat and swam to shore. After witnessing a violent eruption of the feud in which many people are killed, he finds Jim, and they return to the raft.

They continue down the river. Two conmen, calling themselves a king and a duke, find their way to the raft. In one of the towns the king and the duke impersonate the two brothers of Peter Wilks, who has just died and left a small fortune. Huck thwarts their plan to swindle Wilks’ family out of their inheritance. The king and the duke escape, but further down the river the two decide to sell Jim to Silas Phelps, who turns out to be Tom Sawyer’s uncle.

Visiting his aunt and uncle, Tom persuades Huck to join him in an elaborate, ridiculous plan to free Jim. Huck prefers a quicker escape for Jim but caves in to Tom’s wishes. Only after Tom’s plan has been played out, and Jim recaptured, does Tom reveal that Miss Watson had actually freed Jim two months earlier, just before she died. Huck decides to “light out for the Territory,” to head west toward the frontier before anyone can attempt to “sivilize” him again.

Moby-Dick, written in 1851, recounts the adventures of the narrator Ishmael as he sails on the whaling ship, Pequod, under the command of the monomaniacal Captain Ahab. Melville dedicated the book to fellow Dark Romantic, Nathaniel Hawthorne: ""In token of my admiration for his genius, this book is inscribed to Nathaniel Hawthorne."" 
[Teachers and students may find useful our Moby-Dick Study Guide. We also offer a short story version of the chapter, The Chase for your convenience.]

Ishmael believes he has signed onto a routine commission aboard a normal whaling vessel, but he soon learns that Captain Ahab is not guiding the Pequod in the simple pursuit of commerce but is seeking one specific whale, Moby-Dick, a great white whale infamous for his giant size and his ability to destroy the whalers that seek him. Captain Ahab's wooden leg is the result of his first encounter with the whale, when he lost both leg and ship. After the ship sails it becomes clear that Captain Ahab is bent on revenge and he intends to get Moby-Dick.

Ahab demonstrates erratic behavior from the very beginning and his eccentricities magnify as the voyage progresses. As the novel draws to a conclusion, the Pequod encounters the whaling ship Rachel. The Rachel's captain asks Ahab to help him in a search and rescue effort for his whaling-crew that went missing the day before -- and the captain's son is among the missing. But when Ahab learns that the crew disappeared while tangling with Moby-Dick he refuses the call to aid in the rescue so that he may hunt Moby-Dick instead.

The encounter with Moby-Dick brings a tragic end to the affair. Ishmael alone survives, using his friend Queequeg's coffin as a flotation device until he is ironically rescued by the Rachel which has continued to search for its missing crew.

Readers, teachers and students should also take note of a peculiar historical curiosity. After enjoying some success in the 1840s, the publication of Moby-Dick (1851) marked Melville's decline as a popular writer. He was unable to support himself as a writer and accepted a job at the New York Customs House. He continued to write, even as he faded into obscurity, turning to poetry in his later years. He published his poems but they were ignored and went unread. Like his novel about the great white whale, his poems are also esteemed by modern critics and scholars.

It was only in the early 1900s that Moby-Dick gained attention and acclaim. During his lifetime, the novel sold a scant 3,000 copies. In modern times the novel is not only considered a great American classic, it is also heralded as one of greatest novels in the English language.

In Paradise Lost Milton produced poem of epic scale, conjuring up a vast, awe-inspiring cosmos and ranging across huge tracts of space and time. And yet, in putting a charismatic Satan and naked Adam and Eve at the centre of this story, he also created an intensely human tragedy on the Fall of Man. Written when Milton was in his fifties – blind, bitterly disappointed by the Restoration and briefly in danger of execution – Paradise Lost’s apparent ambivalence towards authority has led to intense debate about whether it manages to ‘justify the ways of God to men’, or exposes the cruelty of Christianity. 
John Leonard’s revised edition of Paradise Lost contains full notes, elucidating Milton’s biblical, classical and historical allusions and discussing his vivid, highly original use of language and blank verse.

Sense and Sensibility is a novel that is best understood within the context of the era in which it was written. Austen lived in that period of English history when eighteenth century rationalism was giving way to the increasing popularity of nineteenth century romanticism, as typified by William Wordsworth and the Romantic poets. The open embrace and deliberate cultivation of sensibility—deep feelings and passionate emotions—were perhaps a natural reaction to the admiration of reserve and practicality that had typified the preceding decades.
Austen’s novel, her first published work, offers a portrait of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, who embody the two qualities set forth in the title. Elinor, the elder of the two, is intelligent, loving, and wise enough to see the potential folly in failing to temper emotion with good sense. Marianne, although sharing many of these qualities, lacks her sister’s wisdom; she is, as Austen describes her, “everything but prudent.”
Marianne’s insistence on giving her emotions free rein leads her into an unhappy romance with the fortune-hunting Willoughby when she mistakes his false expressions of sentiment for love. Although Marianne’s own excessive displays of emotion spring from genuine feeling, they blind her to the realization that less fervently expressed emotions may also be heartfelt and true. Waiting patiently throughout the book is the quiet, steadfast Colonel Brandon, a man of deep but reserved feelings who loves Marianne and whose true worth she comes to recognize only after she is forced by her failed romance with Willoughby to reassess her views.
Elinor remains her sister’s mainstay throughout her unhappy first love, assisting her toward maturity with patience and tenderness. She, too, is ín love, with her selfish sister-in-law’s brother, Edward Ferrars. Both are restrained in their expressions of their feelings, Elinor out of modesty and a sense of propriety and Edward because he is secretly and unhappily engaged to another woman favored by his snobbish mother. Yet adherence to principles of rational thought and good sense does not prevent Elinor from suffering greatly when she believes that her hopes of marrying Edward are impossible. Their eventual union is as happy and full of emotion as that of any two people in love. 
Although her own sympathies are perhaps most closely aligned with those of Elinor, Austen writes with affection for both sisters and her message is one of compromise. She is careful to show that a balance of both heart and intellect is necessary for a full life—a blending of sense and sensibility that both Elinor and Marianne possess by the novel’s close.

After our narrator Dr. John Watson gets married (to Mary Morstan, in Conan Doyle's second Sherlock Holmes novel, The Sign of Four) he doesn't see Holmes quite as often as he used to. As Watson sets up a happy home with his wife, Holmes remains as weird as ever, hanging around their old place in Baker Street and alternating between cocaine and criminal cases.

Watson happens to be passing his former apartment on the walk back from his medical practice one evening, and decides to stop in to see his old pal Holmes. The two bat jokes back and forth about Holmes's deductive ability. Holmes finally comes out and asks if Watson can even recall the number of stairs that lead up to the 221B Baker Street apartment, and Watson admits that he cannot. ""Ah ha!"" crows Holmes: proof that, while Watson sees the same things that Holmes does, he fails to observe them.

A new client arrives to meet Holmes and, after trying to hide his identity for about two seconds, comes clean: he is Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein and hereditary King of Bohemia (whoa, that's a lot of letters for one name! Bohemia, by the way, is now part of the modern-day Czech Republic). His problem is that he's about to marry the daughter of the King of Scandinavia. The thing is, though, she's from a family with very strict morals, and she wouldn't be pleased to know that he had a serious affair with another woman before their engagement.

This woman is Irene Adler – who lives on in Holmes's memory as the woman. She's a singer who met the King in Warsaw, where they subsequently had a bit of a fling. Unfortunately, the King allowed himself to be photographed with Adler, and she has the picture. The King wants Holmes to recover the incriminating photo. Holmes agrees.

Holmes then puts on a disguise and goes to Irene Adler's current house in London to stake it out. He finds out that she gets frequent calls from a lawyer, Godfrey Norton. Holmes even happens to be on the site when Adler rushes out of her house to meet Norton at a small church and – get this – our detective is actually called upon (still in disguise) to be the witness for her marriage to the guy. After their surprise elopement, Adler goes back to her house, and Holmes realizes he has to hurry to get the photo back before she has a chance to leave with her new husband.

Holmes comes up with the perfect plan for finding the photo: he disguises himself as a clergyman, stages a riot outside her house, pretends to be injured, and is carried into her living room for medical treatment. Meanwhile, Watson, waiting outside, throws a smoke bomb into her house through the open living room window. In a moment's panic, Adler runs for a small hidden compartment in the wall, where, Holmes guesses, she keeps the photograph. At this discovery, and amidst the confusion, Holmes takes off with Watson in tow. The two wind up back at Holmes's apartment building. As Holmes is looking for his key, a young man walks by and greets him by name, with a cheery ""Good evening.""

The next morning, the King of Bohemia arrives at Holmes's apartment, where Holmes and Watson are waiting. All three head off to Adler's house. To Holmes's surprise, an elderly woman is expecting them. She hands Holmes a letter signed by Irene Adler and addressed to Holmes himself.

Adler's letter tells Holmes that she had been warned that he was on her trail. Even so, she didn't recognize him immediately when she saw him disguised as such a kindly-looking old priest. But she guessed that it was Holmes when she realized the smoke bomb was a fake fire alarm. Adler then confirmed Holmes's identity by putting on men's clothes (she was once an actress), following him to his home, and greeting him by name. Adler tells Holmes she's keeping the photos as collateral against the King should he ever decide to ruin her reputation. But for now, she's content to live with her new, much worthier husband, and she considers the matter finished.

The King is satisfied with this news, even though Holmes apologizes for failing to recover the photo. Holmes then asks the King if he can keep the photograph of Adler alone that accompanied the letter. The King, surprised, agrees. Watson finishes the story by adding that, while Holmes used to joke about women's intelligence, he hasn't been cracking wise lately: Adler will always be, for Holmes, the ultimate woman.

A thirteen-year-old girl in Netherlands is given a diary for her birthday. Two days later she starts writing in it. It would have been the typical diary of a typical teenage girl, only it was the June of 1942, Adolf Hitler had launched his aggressive campaign against the Jews of continental Europe; his armies had taken over much of the continent already Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland falling one after the other like matchsticks-and when the Germans entered Netherlands, the little girl, also a Jew, went into hiding with her father Otto Frank, her mother Edith, sister Margot, and another family of three in a sealed-off room concealed behind a wooden bookcase in the upper annex of the building her father worked in, in Amsterdam. There she would remain in hiding with the others for two years until they would all be betrayed and then whisked away by soldiers of the occupying German forces to a concentration camp where she would ultimately die of typhus, a mere two weeks before she would have been liberated along with the others by British troops had she managed to pull herself through the illness, Anne Frank was fifteen years old when she died in that Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in the early days of March 1945, her short young life snuffed out tragically by the workings of a twisted manic ideology. 
Born in June 1929, Anne Frank would have probably led a life of obscurity had her diary not been published by her father in 1947. She would have remained a number, a faceless statistic lost in a government file supposedly documenting the human side of the Second World War. But, it was not to be so. Though she had started writing in her diary in the summer of 1942, it had never been with the intention of creating a record of her experiences as a Jew in hiding Anne's diary was, for her, a space to express herself in the most honest and candid of terms. She shied away from writing nothing, revealing all and baring her very soul on the pages of the diary. However, in March 1944, Anne heard a radio broadcast by a member of the Dutch government in exile in London who spoke of wanting to create a public archive of the Dutch people's experiences of oppression under the German regime. He asked the people to save all their letters, their diaries, journals, and photographs for they would all prove invaluable to his project. Inspired, Anne began editing her journal with the intention of submitting it for publication once the war was over. She worked her way through two years of writing, always staying true to what she had seen and been through, to what she had written. 
Today, Anne Frank's diary is one of the most important documents to have survived Hitler's madness. Official records and political discourses aside, it is through the victim and the survivor's voices alone that a human story can be woven out of historical tragedies, and Anne's diary does just this. She was thirteen years old when she started writing. She had nothing to prove, no hidden agendas to achieve, no propaganda to spread. She wrote simply because she wanted to. She wrote with the great innocence and sincerity that only children can possess, but what she wrote was not as innocent as she herself was, Amidst all the controversies and debates that have surrounded the Holocaust, Anne's diary, one of the most meticulously-maintained and revealing of documents to come from the victims' side, has become a symbolic text of the Holocaust. Children read abridged versions of the diary as a part of their academic curriculum to acquaint themselves of what a girl their age faced during a particularly terrible time in the 1940s. Academicians and historians revolve works of great merit around it, using it as an authentic source point of historical truth. Of the diary itself, Dutch journalist and historian Jan Romein said in 1946, that although 'stammered out in a child's voice, it 'embodies all the hideousness of fascism, more so than all the evidence at Nuremberg put together 
Anne's voice has reached out across continents and generations. Her diary has kept the victims of Holocaust from slipping into an otherwise inevitable anonymity. She has given others like her a face and a life. She has made it real for all those who lived through it and for those who came after her, like us. It is said that the wound the psyche of

Anne Frank's diary needs no introduction.
This Beautifully Written memoir of a young girl Caught in the middle of one of the most horrific periods of human history
 is a testament to the indestructible human will to persevere and Survive in the face of the most adverse of Circumstances. Where Anne Frank herself became One of the Victims Of the Second World War, her words, crowding every available inch of space in her diary,

The best of times, the worst of times, the age of wisdom, the age of foolishness, the epoch of belief, the epoch of incredulity, the season of Light, the season of Darkness, the spring of hope, the winter of despair, having everything, yet nothing, leading to heaven, yet leading to the other way, the time of the French Revolution was all this and more. In this setting Dickens begins his most famous work, telling the story of the French peasantry demoralised by the French aristocracy in the years leading up to the revolution. Principally the story of Sidney Carton and Lucie Manette, this book follows them and the villainous Madame Defarge to tell a story of darkness, love, forgiveness, revenge and self-sacrifice.

The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Late Spring and Autumn Period (roughly 5th century BC). The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (""Master Sun"", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to an aspect of warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare[1] and has influenced both Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy and beyond.

This book contained a detailed explanation and analysis of the Chinese military, from weapons and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun Tzu also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Because Sun Tzu has long been considered to be one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training for centuries to come.
Chapter summary
1. Detail assessment and planning: explores the five fundamental factors (the Way, seasons, terrain, leadership, and management) and seven elements that determine the outcomes of military engagements. By thinking, assessing and comparing these points, a commander can calculate his chances of victory. Habitual deviation from these calculations will ensure failure via improper action. The text stresses that war is a very grave matter for the state and must not be commenced without due consideration.
2. Waging war : explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how success requires winning decisive engagements quickly. This section advises that successful military campaigns require limiting the cost of competition and conflict.
3. Strategic attack : defines the source of strength as unity, not size, and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war. In order of importance, these critical factors are: Attack, Strategy, Alliances, Army and Cities.
4. Disposition of the army : explains the importance of defending existing positions until a commander is capable of advancing from those positions in safety. It teaches commanders the importance of recognizing strategic opportunities, and teaches not to create opportunities for the enemy.
5. Forces : explains the use of creativity and timing in building an army's momentum.
6. Weaknesses and strengths : explains how an army's opportunities come from the openings in the environment caused by the relative weakness of the enemy and how to respond to changes in the fluid battlefield over a given area.
7. Military maneuvers : explains the dangers of direct conflict and how to win those confrontations when they are forced upon the commander.
8. Variations and adaptability : focuses on the need for flexibility in an army's responses. It explains how to respond to shifting circumstances successfully.
9. Movement and development of troops : describes the different situations in which an army finds itself as it moves through new enemy territories, and how to respond to these situations. Much of this section focuses on evaluating the intentions of others.
10. Terrain : looks at the three general areas of resistance (distance, dangers and barriers) and the six types of ground positions that arise from them. Each of these six field positions offers certain advantages and disadvantages.
11. The nine battlegrounds : describes the nine common situations (or stages) in a campaign, from scattering to deadly, and the specific focus that a commander will need in order to successfully navigate them.
12. Attacking with fire : explains the general use of weapons and the specific use of the environment as a weapon. This section examines the five targets for attack, the five types of environmental attack and the appropriate responses to such attacks.
13. Intelligence and espionage : focuses on the importance of developing good information sources, and specifies the five types of intelligence sources and how to best manage each of them.",The Art of War,Sun Tzu, , ,Fingerprint Publishing,9788172345242,"1st Edition,2014",100,India,English

George Orwell, born Eric Arthur Blair, was a much-respected English novelist, political author, and journalist who wrote some of the finest pieces in literary criticism, poetry, fiction, and polemical journalism. Born on June 25, 1903 in Bihar, India, to a Civil Servant who worked in the then legal opium trade, Orwell moved to London with his mother and elder sister at the age of one. He started his schooling at St Cyprian's, which he referred to as ""a lukewarm bath of snobbery', and later won a scholarship to Eton, but didn't perform well there, perhaps by choice. Having no other option left, he signed up for the Indian Imperial Police and left for Burma (modern-day Myanmar) in 1922. Having grown to hate imperialism and keen to start a fresh career with writing, Orwell returned home in 1927 and moved to Paris. During his years in Paris, he wrote numerous short stories and articles, but he didn't achieve much success with either. He came back to London after he fell seriously ill, and it was here that he wrote under the pseudonym George Orwell for the first time. His first work under this pen-name was Down and Out in Paris and London, a memoir-cum-travelogue themed on poverty in the two capital cities. Considered perhaps the twentieth century's best chronicler of English culture, Orwell's work is known for its simplicity, astuteness, and wit. His writing is mainly within the genres of dystopia and satire, and he wrote with great cleverness on subjects such as anti-fascism, democratic socialism, totalitarianism, and the anti-Stalinist left. He used his fiction writing, as well as his journalism, to defend his political convictions. Orwell's work continues to feed popular and political culture. Many of the words coined by him, such as 'doublethink', 'thought crime', 'Big Brother, and 'thought police', have found a place in popular jargon today.
His best works include Animal Farm, Nineteen Eighty Four, and Homage to Catalonia (which is inspired by his stint in the Spanish Civil War). George Orwell died at the age of forty-six in 1950.

PREFACE
A polemic text, George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty Four is a bold voice that cries out against the cacophony of fascist, communist, and other totalitarian forms of governance. Considered a self-contained critique of the totalitarian state, this Orwellian masterpiece has given the modern world much of its popular political jargon. 
Set in Oceania, one of the three intercontinental super states that divided the world among themselves after a global atomic war, the story unfolds in London, the chief city of Airstrip One, governed by the Party headed by the Big Brother. Posters screaming BIG BROTHER IS WATCHINGYOU” clutter every inch of available public and private space in the city. Every street corner, every lamp post, and every wall has life-size pictures of Big Brother's face, his eyes following the wary citizens as they walk past it.
When the book opens, it is a bright cold day in April, the clocks are 'striking thirteen, and the protagonist, Winston Smith, is in the clutches of a dystopian future. The world as we know it has been obliterated by a global atomic war. Those who have survived it are living in what are the ruins of an England already ravaged by World War II, civil conflict, and the political revolution which brought the Party to power. Winston Smith is a member of the Outer Party which consists, almost entirely, of the middle class. He works for Minitrue, the Ministry of Truth, where he is an editor responsible for changing and doctoring the past, day in and day out, to match the Party's ever-changing official version, intended to make the state an omniscient entity. This perpetual engagement with state-sponsored rewriting of history inspires within Winston a dangerous fascination for the true past, and he tries, discreetly, and against the state diktat, to unearth as much of the truth as he can. 
In a world where thought crime is death, where a fascination with the true past is an offense punishable by death, Winston starts maintaining a journal criticizing the Party and Big Brother, its enigmatic leader. He writes sitting at his desk in an alcove in his flat, at an angle that hides him from the intrusive eyes of the telescreen, a privacy that is as much a rebellion as it is a rarity, And then one day, in the middle of his daily work and private rebellion, he meets Julia, a young dark-haired mechanic who repairs the Minitrue novel-writing machines. From here begins Winston's fall into an abyss which takes both Julia and him them through love, painful confessions, betrayals and much more. 
What George Orwell did in Nineteen Eighty Four was not only ahead of its times, but it was revolutionary as well. And revolutionary in more than one sense. While it commented upon the times to come in a rather ominous prophetic manner-newscasters even today talk about an Orwellian present/future-the text also shed light upon the conditions that defined much of the world when Orwell actually set about writing it. Orwell touched upon a raw nerve as he shaped Winston Smith, giving a voice and a face to all the popular fears and nightmares that were running in everyone's heads about the rot that had set in in the social and political structures of the day. 
Can Nineteen Eighty Four, then, be considered to be a prophecy? A prophecy of sorts, perhaps, yes. The text did touch upon problem points that were, then, yet to come, and which, now, are very much a part of the present. It was a warning ahead of its times, a cautionary piece of writing about human freedom being on the verge of enslavement by the chains of political organization and technology, about how power, once acquired, needs absolute sacrifice for the sake of those seeking it and maintaining it. 
While Nineteen Eighty Four is often hailed as an excellent piece of modern science fiction literature dealing with dystopian futures, it is also at once a commentary on the ideas of revolution, war, totalitarianism, nationalism, and political geographies. It grapples, at the same time, with such issues as living standards and extreme censorship, 
Most of the original novel was written in Jura between 1947 to 1948. During this time, George Orwell himself was seriously ill, suffering from tuberculosis. The book was finally sent to the publisher on the 4"" of December, 1948 and published on the 8"" of June the following year.

Pride and Prejudice is set in rural England in the early 19th century, and it follows the Bennet family, which includes five very different sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious to see all her daughters married, especially as the modest family estate is to be inherited by William Collins when Mr. Bennet dies. At a ball, the wealthy and newly arrived Charles Bingley takes an immediate interest in the eldest Bennet daughter, the beautiful and shy Jane. The encounter between his friend Darcy and Elizabeth is less cordial. Although Austen shows them intrigued by each other, she reverses the convention of first impressions: pride of rank and fortune and prejudice against the social inferiority of Elizabeth’s family hold Darcy aloof, while Elizabeth is equally fired both by the pride of self-respect and by prejudice against Darcy’s snobbery.

The pompous Collins subsequently arrives, hoping to marry one of the Bennet sisters. Elizabeth, however, refuses his offer of marriage, and he instead becomes engaged to her friend Charlotte Lucas. During this time, Elizabeth encounters the charming George Wickham, a military officer. There is a mutual attraction between the two, and he informs her that Darcy has denied him his inheritance.

After Bingley abruptly departs for London, Elizabeth’s dislike of Darcy increases as she becomes convinced that he is discouraging Bingley’s relationship with Jane. Darcy, however, has grown increasingly fond of Elizabeth, admiring her intelligence and vitality. While visiting the now-married Charlotte, Elizabeth sees Darcy, who professes his love for her and proposes. A surprised Elizabeth refuses his offer, and, when Darcy demands an explanation, she accuses him of breaking up Jane and Bingley. Darcy subsequently writes Elizabeth a letter in which he explains that he separated the couple largely because he did not believe Jane returned Bingley’s affection. He also discloses that Wickham, after squandering his inheritance, tried to marry Darcy’s then 15-year-old sister in an attempt to gain possession of her fortune. With these revelations, Elizabeth begins to see Darcy in a new light.

Shortly thereafter the youngest Bennet sister, Lydia, elopes with Wickham. The news is met with great alarm by Elizabeth, since the scandalous affair—which is unlikely to end in marriage—could ruin the reputation of the other Bennet sisters. When she tells Darcy, he persuades Wickham to marry Lydia, offering him money. Despite Darcy’s attempt to keep his intervention a secret, Elizabeth learns of his actions. At the encouragement of Darcy, Bingley subsequently returns, and he and Jane become engaged. Finally, Darcy proposes again to Elizabeth, who this time accepts.",Pride and  Prejudice,Jane Austen, , ,Fingerprint Publishing,9788172344504,"1st Edition,2016",407,India,English

Although it had a tortuous publication history after Franklin's death, this work has become one of the most famous and influential examples of an autobiography ever written. Franklin was a statesman, author, inventor, printer, and scientist. 
Part One of The Autobiography is addressed to Franklin's son William, at that time (1771) Royal Governor of New Jersey. While in England at the estate of the Bishop of St Asaph in Twyford, Franklin, now 65 years old, begins by saying that it may be agreeable to his son to know some of the incidents of his father's life; so with a week's uninterrupted leisure, he is beginning to write them down for William. He starts with some anecdotes of his grandfather, uncles, father and mother. He deals with his childhood, his fondness for reading, and his service as an apprentice to his brother James Franklin, a Boston printer and the publisher of the New England Courant. After improving his writing skills through study of the Spectator by Joseph Addison and Sir Richard Steele, he writes an anonymous paper and slips it under the door of the printing house by night. Not knowing its author, James and his friends praise the paper and it is published in the Courant, which encourages Ben to produce more essays (the ""Silence Dogood"" essays) which are also published. When Ben reveals his authorship, James is angered, thinking the recognition of his papers will make Ben too vain. James and Ben have frequent disputes and Ben seeks for a way to escape from working under James. 
The second part begins with two letters Franklin received in the early 1780s while in Paris, encouraging him to continue the Autobiography, of which both correspondents have read Part One. (Although Franklin does not say so, there had been a breach with his son William after the writing of Part One, since the father had sided with the Revolutionaries and the son had remained loyal to the British Crown. 
Beginning in August 1788 when Franklin had returned to Philadelphia, the author says he will not be able to utilize his papers as much as he had expected, since many were lost in the recent Revolutionary War. He has, however, found and quotes a couple of his writings from the 1730s that survived. One is the ""Substance of an intended Creed"" consisting of what he then considered to be the ""Essentials"" of all religions. He had intended this as a basis for a projected sect but, Franklin says, did not pursue the project.

The Little Prince first published in April 1943, is a novella, the most famous work of French aristocrat, writer, poet, and pioneering aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.

The novella is one of the most-translated books in the world and has been voted the best book of the 20th century in France. Translated into 300 languages and dialects, selling nearly two million copies annually, and with year-to-date sales of over 140 million copies worldwide, it has become one of the best-selling books ever published.

After the outbreak of the Second World War, Saint-Exupéry escaped to North America. Despite personal upheavals and failing health, he produced almost half of the writings for which he would be remembered, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss, in the form of a young prince visiting Earth. An earlier memoir by the author had recounted his aviation experiences in the Sahara Desert, and he is thought to have drawn on those same experiences in The Little Prince.

Since its first publication, the novella has been adapted to numerous art forms and media, including audio recordings, radio plays, live stage, film, television, ballet, and opera.",The Little Prince,Antoine De Saint Exupery, , ,Fingerprint Publishing,9788175993570,"1st Edition,2016",144,India,English

Anna Karenina is the tragic story of Countess Anna Karenina, a married noblewoman and socialite, and her affair with the affluent Count Vronsky. The story starts when she arrives in the midst of a family broken up by her brother's unbridled womanizing—something that prefigures her own later situation, though she would experience less tolerance by others.

A bachelor, Vronsky is eager to marry Anna if she will agree to leave her husband Count Karenin, a senior government official, but she is vulnerable to the pressures of Russian social norms, the moral laws of the Russian Orthodox Church, her own insecurities, and Karenin's indecision. Although Vronsky and Anna go to Italy, where they can be together, they have trouble making friends. Back in Russia, she is shunned, becoming further isolated and anxious, while Vronsky pursues his social life. Despite Vronsky's reassurances, she grows increasingly possessive and paranoid about his imagined infidelity, fearing loss of control.

A parallel story within the novel is that of Konstantin Lëvin or Ljovin, a wealthy country landowner who wants to marry Princess Kitty, sister to Princess Dolly and sister-in-law to Anna's brother Prince Oblonsky. Konstantin has to propose twice before Kitty accepts. The novel details Konstantin's difficulties managing his estate, his eventual marriage, and his struggle to accept the Christian faith, until the birth of his first child.

The novel explores a diverse range of topics throughout its approximately one thousand pages. Some of these topics include an evaluation of the feudal system that existed in Russia at the time—politics, not only in the Russian government but also at the level of the individual characters and families, religion, morality, gender and social class.",Anna Karenina,Leo Tolstoy, , ,Fingerprint Publishing,9788175993426,"1st Edition,2016",760,India,English

The Jungle Book is seven mostly unrelated short stories—some not even in the jungle—and seven short works of verse related to the story.

The first set of three stories stars a young boy named Mowgli. He is raised by wolves, trained by a bear, kidnapped by monkeys, rescued by a panther and a snake, and kills and skins a tiger. All this before he hits puberty.

In ""The White Seal,"" Kotick, the titular white seal, who lives in the Bering Sea (which is not the jungle), sees his adorable, cute, cuddly, fuzzy seal buddies get clubbed to death and their bloody skins ripped from their little bodies. Yikes. He decides to search for an island where all seals can be safe, but when he finds it, all the seals are too lazy to move. Talk about ungrateful, right? Kotick, who's all big and strong from all the swimming, kicks all the seals' tails. Impressed by his strength, they follow him to safety.

Our protagonist in ""Toomai of the Elephants"" is Toomai (of the elephants). He follows his elephant Kala Nag into the jungle and witnesses a top-secret elephant dance ritual.

Finally, there's ""Our Majesty's Servants,"" in which a bunch of military service animals—donkeys, camels, and horses, oh my—chat about fear and obedience.

The Prince of Denmark, Hamlet is in Germany in pursuit of education. Suddenly he is called to Denmark to attain the funeral of his father. When he comes home, he is shocked to see his mother Gertrude already to his uncle, Claudius and he himself has declared the king. Claudius has neglected the fact that the rightful heir to the throne is Prince Hamlet. After observing the situation, Hamlet smells a rat and doubts his uncle.
One night, the ghost of his father visits Prince Hamlet and tells him that he was murdered by his uncle Claudius when he was in sleep. He further says that he was poured poison in his ears while in deep sleep. The ghost entrusts Hamlet with a work of revenge the murderer Claudius and leave Gertrude in the hand of Heaven.

Hamlet plans to put on the fake mask of madness in the castle so as to observe the interaction and get to the truth. But he discovers himself in the great confusion and bewilderment. As he is a philosophical Prince, he keeps on thinking and raises the existence of the ghost and its truth. His behavior is changed because of his confusion and becomes moody. He thinks of staging a play putting the same murder scene that the ghost has described to him. He adds the scene of the murder, calling it The Mousetrap, in the middle of the play The Murder of Gonzago. He had expected that if the ghost is right, then it scene would work on the king and he would certainly show some odd behavior. As expected, the king could not breathe and wants the light, so he leaves the room. Now, Hamlet is fully convinced that he is the real killer of his father. He vows to kill him, but the problem with him is that he is too conscious and thinks a lot. His thought and philosophy immobilize him.

His passive and reluctant act of taking revenge takes the lives of six innocent people. When Hamlet and the queen are in the private chamber, Polonius spies on them. Hamlet discovers this fact and stabs him. Hamlet is punished for killing Polonius and he is sent to England. There he is spied by his school friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. When he knows about this, he arranges the hanging of these two friends instead. When Ophelia, whom Hamlet loves, comes to know that Hamlet has killed her father Polonius, she becomes mad and dies singing sad songs. Laertes, her brother comes from France, witnesses the death of his father and sister, gets angry on Hamlet and both fight.

For sheer storytelling delight and pure adventure, Treasure Island has never been surpassed. From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle, the nevel creates scenes and characters that have firetd the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist, a master of both action and atmosphere, the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil. It is the villainy of that most ambiguous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery, greed, and daring. Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons, Treasure Island is, in the words of G. K. Chesterton, 'the realization of an ideal, that which is promised in its provocative and beckoning map; a vision not only of white skeletons but also green palm trees and sapphire seas.' G. S. Fraser terms it 'an utterly original book' and goes on to write: 'There will always be a place for stories like Treasure Island that can keep boys and old men happy.",Treasure Island,Robert Louis Stevenson, , ,Fingerprint Publishing,9788172344764,"Published,2013",236,India,English

The play opens with Macbeth and Banquo, two of the Scottish King Duncan’s generals returning from battle when they encounter three witches in the woods. The witches tell Macbeth of how he will become the Thane of Cawdor and then the King of Scotland. For Banquo, they prophesize that he will beget the line of Scottish Kings, though he will never become king himself. The two are sufficiently skeptical and continue their journey home.
However, when the two come closer to the encampment, they are presented with a messenger from King Duncan who announces that Macbeth has been made the Thane of Cawdor, immediately putting the prophecy into perspective, making Macbeth wonder how he might become king. He invites Duncan to dine at his castle that evening and goes ahead to tell his wife of the day’s events.
Unlike Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is very sure of her husband’s future, desiring the throne and telling him that they must murder Duncan to ensure his ascension. Immediately upon returning to his castle, Lady Macbeth is able to convince her husband to take initiative and murder Duncan that very night.
The two plan to get Duncan’s chamberlains drunk enough that they will not remember the evening and blame them for the murder. When the body of Duncan is discovered in the morning, Macbeth quickly kills the “culprits” and assumes the kingship. All the while, Duncan’s sons flee the country, afraid for their own lives. 
Immediately, Macbeth’s misgivings and trust in the prophecies force his hand in the murder of Banquo and his son Fleance as well, afraid that his heirs will seize the throne. Successfully killing Banquo, the murderers fail to kill Fleance. 
The night of his murder, Banquo’s ghost appears to Macbeth and sends him into hysteria, scaring his guests and angering his wife. His very presence as the king of Scotland has angered the other nobles and further incites Macbeth’s misgivings and paranoia. 
To ease his fears, he visits the witches again and they offer to him more prophecies. He must beware of Macduff, a chief opponent to Macbeth taking the throne. He cannot be harmed by any man born of woman and he is safe until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane Castle. He returns home and finds that Macduff has fled to England to join Malcom. In fear, Macbeth seizes Macduff’s castle and orders the murder of his wife and children, inciting Macduff to further rage. With Malcom, the two raise an army and ride to Scotland to take on Macbeth with the support of the Scottish nobles who fear Macbeth’s tyranny and murderous ways.
While Macbeth awaits his opponents, Lady Macbeth is in the process of going mad, unable to wash the blood from her hands. The news of her suicide reaches Macbeth directly before the arrival of the English forces and sends him into an even deeper despair. He awaits confidently as the prophecy foretold his invulnerability. However, Macduff’s forces arrive under the cover of boughs cut from Birnam wood. When Macbeth is finally confronted by Macduff after his forces have been overwhelmed, Macduff announces that he was “ripped from his mother’s womb” not born and ultimately defeats and beheads Macbeth, handing the crown back to Malcolm, the rightful heir.

War And Peace is a classic novel that delves into the dual themes of war and love. The book was first published in 1869 and is widely considered as Leo Tolstoy’s magnum opus. 

Summary Of The Book:

Originally written in Russian, War And Peace has been translated into a number of languages, including English. The novel, though one of the longest ever written, is a must read for every literature enthusiast. The novel is set in the early 19th century and revolves around the French invasion of Russia by Napoleon. War And Peace is truly an epic in itself and is divided into four volumes and has an epilogue in two parts. Most of the characters of the large cast are introduced early, at a social party in St. Petersburg. While the novel is fictional in nature, it does include some historical facts and figures, such as Alexander I and Napoleon, and the French Invasion of Russia in 1812 and the Napoleonic Wars. The novel takes us on an unforgettable journey as we encounter various characters in search of love amidst war and peace. The novel’s plot can be seen from two different perspectives. First, it depicts the Napoleonic invasion of Russia, and the Russian war efforts to defeat the French. The other plot is mainly concerned with the personal dramas of five aristocratic families, particularly the Bolkonskys, the Bezukhovs, and the Rostovs. The novel follows these representatives of the Russian aristocracy, as they build their lives in a war torn empire. The principal characters of the novel are three young aristocrats, Pierre, Andrei and Natasha. While the novel focuses on the aristocracy, the peasantry and the soldiers are given ample voice throughout. War And Peace is not just a novel about human emotions, frailties and history, but it is also a discourse on Tolstoy’s philosophies. The later part of the novel includes many sections that throw light on Tolstoy’s philosophical ideologies.

Mark Twain blends many comic elements into the story of Huck Finn, a boy about 13 years old, living in pre-Civil War Missouri. Huck, the novel’s narrator, has been living with the Widow Douglas and her sister, Miss Watson, in the town of St. Petersburg. They have been trying to “sivilize” him with proper dress, manners, and religious piety. He finds this life constraining and false and would rather live free and wild. When his father hears that Huck has come into a large amount of money, he kidnaps him and locks him in an old cabin across the river. To avoid his father’s cruel beatings, Huck elaborately stages his own death and then escapes to Jackson’s Island. He finds Jim, Miss Watson’s runaway slave, on the island, and the two decide to hide out together. To avoid danger of discovery, they decide to float down the river on a raft they had found earlier. Sleeping during the day and traveling at night, they plan to connect with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois, which would lead them north into the free states, where slavery is outlawed. They miss Cairo in the fog one night and find themselves floating deeper into slave territory. While they are searching for a canoe, a steamship hits the raft and damages it. Huck and Jim are separated.

Huck swims ashore where he meets the feuding Grangerfords and Shepherdsons. He claims to be George Jackson, a passenger who fell from a steamboat and swam to shore. After witnessing a violent eruption of the feud in which many people are killed, he finds Jim, and they return to the raft.

They continue down the river. Two conmen, calling themselves a king and a duke, find their way to the raft. In one of the towns the king and the duke impersonate the two brothers of Peter Wilks, who has just died and left a small fortune. Huck thwarts their plan to swindle Wilks’ family out of their inheritance. The king and the duke escape, but further down the river the two decide to sell Jim to Silas Phelps, who turns out to be Tom Sawyer’s uncle.

Visiting his aunt and uncle, Tom persuades Huck to join him in an elaborate, ridiculous plan to free Jim. Huck prefers a quicker escape for Jim but caves in to Tom’s wishes. Only after Tom’s plan has been played out, and Jim recaptured, does Tom reveal that Miss Watson had actually freed Jim two months earlier, just before she died. Huck decides to “light out for the Territory,” to head west toward the frontier before anyone can attempt to “sivilize” him again.

Moby-Dick, written in 1851, recounts the adventures of the narrator Ishmael as he sails on the whaling ship, Pequod, under the command of the monomaniacal Captain Ahab. Melville dedicated the book to fellow Dark Romantic, Nathaniel Hawthorne: ""In token of my admiration for his genius, this book is inscribed to Nathaniel Hawthorne."" 
[Teachers and students may find useful our Moby-Dick Study Guide. We also offer a short story version of the chapter, The Chase for your convenience.]

Ishmael believes he has signed onto a routine commission aboard a normal whaling vessel, but he soon learns that Captain Ahab is not guiding the Pequod in the simple pursuit of commerce but is seeking one specific whale, Moby-Dick, a great white whale infamous for his giant size and his ability to destroy the whalers that seek him. Captain Ahab's wooden leg is the result of his first encounter with the whale, when he lost both leg and ship. After the ship sails it becomes clear that Captain Ahab is bent on revenge and he intends to get Moby-Dick.

Ahab demonstrates erratic behavior from the very beginning and his eccentricities magnify as the voyage progresses. As the novel draws to a conclusion, the Pequod encounters the whaling ship Rachel. The Rachel's captain asks Ahab to help him in a search and rescue effort for his whaling-crew that went missing the day before -- and the captain's son is among the missing. But when Ahab learns that the crew disappeared while tangling with Moby-Dick he refuses the call to aid in the rescue so that he may hunt Moby-Dick instead.

The encounter with Moby-Dick brings a tragic end to the affair. Ishmael alone survives, using his friend Queequeg's coffin as a flotation device until he is ironically rescued by the Rachel which has continued to search for its missing crew.

Readers, teachers and students should also take note of a peculiar historical curiosity. After enjoying some success in the 1840s, the publication of Moby-Dick (1851) marked Melville's decline as a popular writer. He was unable to support himself as a writer and accepted a job at the New York Customs House. He continued to write, even as he faded into obscurity, turning to poetry in his later years. He published his poems but they were ignored and went unread. Like his novel about the great white whale, his poems are also esteemed by modern critics and scholars.

It was only in the early 1900s that Moby-Dick gained attention and acclaim. During his lifetime, the novel sold a scant 3,000 copies. In modern times the novel is not only considered a great American classic, it is also heralded as one of greatest novels in the English language.

In Paradise Lost Milton produced poem of epic scale, conjuring up a vast, awe-inspiring cosmos and ranging across huge tracts of space and time. And yet, in putting a charismatic Satan and naked Adam and Eve at the centre of this story, he also created an intensely human tragedy on the Fall of Man. Written when Milton was in his fifties – blind, bitterly disappointed by the Restoration and briefly in danger of execution – Paradise Lost’s apparent ambivalence towards authority has led to intense debate about whether it manages to ‘justify the ways of God to men’, or exposes the cruelty of Christianity. 
John Leonard’s revised edition of Paradise Lost contains full notes, elucidating Milton’s biblical, classical and historical allusions and discussing his vivid, highly original use of language and blank verse. 

About the Author

Sense and Sensibility is a novel that is best understood within the context of the era in which it was written. Austen lived in that period of English history when eighteenth century rationalism was giving way to the increasing popularity of nineteenth century romanticism, as typified by William Wordsworth and the Romantic poets. The open embrace and deliberate cultivation of sensibility—deep feelings and passionate emotions—were perhaps a natural reaction to the admiration of reserve and practicality that had typified the preceding decades.
Austen’s novel, her first published work, offers a portrait of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, who embody the two qualities set forth in the title. Elinor, the elder of the two, is intelligent, loving, and wise enough to see the potential folly in failing to temper emotion with good sense. Marianne, although sharing many of these qualities, lacks her sister’s wisdom; she is, as Austen describes her, “everything but prudent.”
Marianne’s insistence on giving her emotions free rein leads her into an unhappy romance with the fortune-hunting Willoughby when she mistakes his false expressions of sentiment for love. Although Marianne’s own excessive displays of emotion spring from genuine feeling, they blind her to the realization that less fervently expressed emotions may also be heartfelt and true. Waiting patiently throughout the book is the quiet, steadfast Colonel Brandon, a man of deep but reserved feelings who loves Marianne and whose true worth she comes to recognize only after she is forced by her failed romance with Willoughby to reassess her views.
Elinor remains her sister’s mainstay throughout her unhappy first love, assisting her toward maturity with patience and tenderness. She, too, is ín love, with her selfish sister-in-law’s brother, Edward Ferrars. Both are restrained in their expressions of their feelings, Elinor out of modesty and a sense of propriety and Edward because he is secretly and unhappily engaged to another woman favored by his snobbish mother. Yet adherence to principles of rational thought and good sense does not prevent Elinor from suffering greatly when she believes that her hopes of marrying Edward are impossible. Their eventual union is as happy and full of emotion as that of any two people in love. 
Although her own sympathies are perhaps most closely aligned with those of Elinor, Austen writes with affection for both sisters and her message is one of compromise. She is careful to show that a balance of both heart and intellect is necessary for a full life—a blending of sense and sensibility that both Elinor and Marianne possess by the novel’s close.

After our narrator Dr. John Watson gets married (to Mary Morstan, in Conan Doyle's second Sherlock Holmes novel, The Sign of Four) he doesn't see Holmes quite as often as he used to. As Watson sets up a happy home with his wife, Holmes remains as weird as ever, hanging around their old place in Baker Street and alternating between cocaine and criminal cases.

Watson happens to be passing his former apartment on the walk back from his medical practice one evening, and decides to stop in to see his old pal Holmes. The two bat jokes back and forth about Holmes's deductive ability. Holmes finally comes out and asks if Watson can even recall the number of stairs that lead up to the 221B Baker Street apartment, and Watson admits that he cannot. ""Ah ha!"" crows Holmes: proof that, while Watson sees the same things that Holmes does, he fails to observe them.

A new client arrives to meet Holmes and, after trying to hide his identity for about two seconds, comes clean: he is Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein and hereditary King of Bohemia (whoa, that's a lot of letters for one name! Bohemia, by the way, is now part of the modern-day Czech Republic). His problem is that he's about to marry the daughter of the King of Scandinavia. The thing is, though, she's from a family with very strict morals, and she wouldn't be pleased to know that he had a serious affair with another woman before their engagement.

This woman is Irene Adler – who lives on in Holmes's memory as the woman. She's a singer who met the King in Warsaw, where they subsequently had a bit of a fling. Unfortunately, the King allowed himself to be photographed with Adler, and she has the picture. The King wants Holmes to recover the incriminating photo. Holmes agrees.

Holmes then puts on a disguise and goes to Irene Adler's current house in London to stake it out. He finds out that she gets frequent calls from a lawyer, Godfrey Norton. Holmes even happens to be on the site when Adler rushes out of her house to meet Norton at a small church and – get this – our detective is actually called upon (still in disguise) to be the witness for her marriage to the guy. After their surprise elopement, Adler goes back to her house, and Holmes realizes he has to hurry to get the photo back before she has a chance to leave with her new husband.

Holmes comes up with the perfect plan for finding the photo: he disguises himself as a clergyman, stages a riot outside her house, pretends to be injured, and is carried into her living room for medical treatment. Meanwhile, Watson, waiting outside, throws a smoke bomb into her house through the open living room window. In a moment's panic, Adler runs for a small hidden compartment in the wall, where, Holmes guesses, she keeps the photograph. At this discovery, and amidst the confusion, Holmes takes off with Watson in tow. The two wind up back at Holmes's apartment building. As Holmes is looking for his key, a young man walks by and greets him by name, with a cheery ""Good evening.""

The next morning, the King of Bohemia arrives at Holmes's apartment, where Holmes and Watson are waiting. All three head off to Adler's house. To Holmes's surprise, an elderly woman is expecting them. She hands Holmes a letter signed by Irene Adler and addressed to Holmes himself.

Adler's letter tells Holmes that she had been warned that he was on her trail. Even so, she didn't recognize him immediately when she saw him disguised as such a kindly-looking old priest. But she guessed that it was Holmes when she realized the smoke bomb was a fake fire alarm. Adler then confirmed Holmes's identity by putting on men's clothes (she was once an actress), following him to his home, and greeting him by name. Adler tells Holmes she's keeping the photos as collateral against the King should he ever decide to ruin her reputation. But for now, she's content to live with her new, much worthier husband, and she considers the matter finished.

The King is satisfied with this news, even though Holmes apologizes for failing to recover the photo. Holmes then asks the King if he can keep the photograph of Adler alone that accompanied the letter. The King, surprised, agrees. Watson finishes the story by adding that, while Holmes used to joke about women's intelligence, he hasn't been cracking wise lately: Adler will always be, for Holmes, the ultimate woman.
