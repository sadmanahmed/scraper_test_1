Journey to Bangladesh
The contributions to this volume by Rehman Sobhan date back
to 1961 and extend upto December 1971 when he was
campaigning for Bangladesh during the liberation war. They
include academic papers, articles for newspapers and other
written inputs which were designed to both inform and
influence public opinion in support of self-rule for Bangladesh.
The writings provide a sequential narrative which blends
economic analysis with journalistic reportage of important
historical events and can be read both as a history of events as
well as of ideas, which culminated in the emergence of an
independent Bangladesh.
The first part of the volume provides an intellectual history of
Sobhan's participation in the debates on what was then defined
as the two economies dividing Pakistan and the consequential
economic deprivation of the Bangalis. These writings of his
were influential in shaping the political debates of the time
which culminated in the presentation of the 6 Point agenda of
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The second part of this
volume provides reportage on the historic political struggles
which were provoked by the denial of democratic rights to the
Bangalis, and its culmination in the war of national liberation.
The concluding section on the Idea of Bangladesh
retrospectively reviews the economic basis of Bangladeshi
nationalism and the catalytic role of Bangabandhu in the birth
of an independent Bangladesh.",From Two Economies To Two Nations: My Journey to Bangladesh,Prof. Rehman Sobhan, , ,Daily Star Books,9789849027287,"Reprint,2016",293,Bangladesh,English

Shahzaman Mozumder was barely out of his childhood when Pakistan launched its war on the Bangalees in 1971. It was a war of unparalleled atrocity against an innocent people that ultimately cost 3 million lives. But the Bangalees did not sit idle. They took up arms to fight back. Mozumder was one of them. As a teenager who should have gone to classes rather than taking guerilla training he joined the war. Instead of holding pens, he held machine guns. He fought in Teliapara of Sylhet.

The Guerrilla is his own story of how a boy became a soldier and showed so much of heroics to get the gallantry award of Bir Protik. It is a moving tale of the war, every moment of it comes alive with his lucid description. Its details are so vivid that the heroics, the tragedies and the moments of life and death pass before your eyes like a motion picture. It shows how a soldier can only hope for another day’s survival.

Star Toons: A cartoon guide to Bangladesh is a compilation of cartoons by Sharier Khan, printed in The Daily Star between 1992 and 2005. Shariar Khan is a noted journalist and has been with The Daily Star ever since he graduated in Journalism from Dhaka University in 1991. Regarded as an expert on the power and energy sector, he’s also a pioneering figure in bringing cartoons to the fore as a medium of sharp criticism of contemporary social and political scenes. As the title suggests, this book takes readers on a tour of the country’s politics and political leaders and various institutional irregularities causing immense suffering to common people. But what makes him a successful cartoonist is his unique way of combining his harsh criticism with wit and humour. Not only for those interested particularly in cartoons, it is a must read also for those with an interest in political and social issues.",Star Toons,Daily Star Books, , ,Daily Star Books,9843229878,"1st,2006",256,Bangladesh,English

Swollen, bullet-riddled corpses flowed down the hundreds of
rivers that formed this delta. The air reeked of decomposing bodies. Vultures and jackals invaded neighbourhoods. People lived by the day, not sure of seeing the next morning. That was 1971 Bangladesh. Yet four decades down the line, Pakistan has not said one single word of remorse and apology for what it did. Not only that, it has repeatedly denied the killings of innocent civilians during those nine months of war. The most recent of its denials came when two war criminals - Salauddin Quader Chowdhury and Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed - were executed in November 2015 for their crimes in 1971. This blatant lie of Pakistan led to a series of reports in The Daily Star with the help of data from various documents including those written by Pakistani generals who were responsible for the genocide and whose writings could not hide the massacre they did.

The CIA chief, Leon Panetta, calls drones the ‘only game in town’. The figures bear him out. Between 2004 and 2012, the US reportedly conducted over 350 drone strikes in Pakistan, killing between 2,600 and 3,400 people. Drone strikes have killed more than 200 children alone in Pakistan and Yemen.
In 2000, the Americans had fewer than fifty aerial drones; ten years later, it had a fleet of nearly 7,500, and the US Air Force now trains more drone ‘pilots’ than bomber and fighter pilots combined. Drones are already a $ 5 billion business in the US alone.
American activist Medea Benjamin, a co-founder of the peace group CODEPINK and the international human rights organization Global Exchange, provides the first extensive analysis of who is producing the drones, where they are being used, who controls these unmanned places, and what are the legal and moral implications of their use. Benjamin also looks at what activists, lawyers, and scientists across the globe are doing to ground these weapons.",Drone Warfare : Killing by Remote Control, , ,Daily Star Books,Daily Star Books,9789849027140, ,241,Bangladesh,English

Who killed twenty-four-year-old Priscilla Hart? And why would anyone want to murder this idealistic American student who had come to India to volunteer in a women’s health programme? Had her work made a killer out of an enraged husband? Or was her death the result of a xenophobic attack? Was she involved in an indiscriminate love affair that had spun out of control? Or was she simply the innocent victim of a riot that had exploded in that fateful year of 1987 between Hindus and Muslims? Shashi Tharoor experiments brilliantly with narrative form, chronicling the mystery of Priscilla Hart’s death through the often contradictory accounts of a dozen or more characters. Intellectually provocative and emotionally charged, Riot is a novel about the ownership of history, about love, hate, cultural collision, religious fanaticism and the impossibility of knowing the truth.",Riot,Shashi Tharoor, , ,Daily Star Books,9789849027126,"1st Published,2013",272,Bangladesh,English

One day, a strange storm strikes, cutting off the town from the outside world. Dozens of people transform into nightmarish creatures with razor-sharp jaws and claws.

In other words, these are stories of cultural encounters. 
The title story is about Mrs. Nagai, an elderly and amicable Japanese woman whose husband was an ex-Japanese soldier during the Second World War. It incorporates conflicting narratives of the war, without tilting to any one side, but it is through Mrs. Nagai’s character that readers see the war in a new light. In ‘Pepsi’, a culturally alienated Bangladeshi girl whose father is a diplomat in Ethiopia spends time with a bunch of poor kids living across the street only to see them evicted as a consequence of this friendship. ‘Raisins not Virgins’ is a witty love story that pivots around a Bangladeshi American couple in New York City. While the man stands vehemently against repressive US policies against Muslims the world over, the woman reprimands conservative Islamic ideologies. ‘Alexander Detained’ is particularly important for it shows what it means to be a Muslim in the US following the 9/11 attacks and imagines a dystopia that is not so outlandish. 
What makes these stories stand out from the very beginning is their tonality, which is fresh and challenges agreed-upon perceptions of the world. She often uses humour to illuminate human frailty.  Her characters are vividly described and her awareness of current international politics is engaging, to say the least.


Sharbari Zohra Ahmed received an MA in creative writing from New York University.  Her fiction has appeared in The Gettysburg Review, Caravan Magazine, Catamaran, and the Asian Pacific American Journal.  Her short fiction was published in the anthologies The New Anthem: A Subcontinent in its Own Words, (Tranquebar, 2009) and Lifelines (Zubaan, 2012).  In 2003, she won the First Words Literary Award for her short story Raisins Not Virgins, which she adapted into a stage play that was produced in Boston, Los Angeles, New York City (The Workshop Theater Co and The Lark Theater) and Dhaka.  Her screenplay for Raisins Not Virgins was selected for the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival All Access Program.  She is a regular columnist at the Weekend Magazine of The Daily Star - the widest read English language daily in Bangladesh, and teaches English Composition at Norwalk Community College in Norwalk, Connecticut. The Ocean of Mrs. Nagai is her first collection of short stories.

Something had happened in 1971, the year the war broke out with the Bengalis in then East Pakistan, now Bangladesh.

‘When you understand that pressure is part and parcel of your life and there are things you can do to control it, you will face up to it in a positive way and use it to your advantage’
									---- Rahul Dravid

Back Cover Text
A medical practitioner who has done pioneering work in the field of sports psychology, Dr Rudi Webster draws up a fail-safe recipe for on-the-ground performance enhancement in this remarkable book. He ropes in some of the world’s finest sportsmen to explain their own success techniques: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman, Clive Lloyd, Dennis Lillee, Wasim Akram, Jacques Kallis and Sir Garry Sobers. They talk about the four interconnected pillars that performance in sports is built on: fitness, technique, strategy and mental skill—but, unanimously, they declare that the mental pillar is the most important. At the highest level of sport, it’s this skill that determines how well the other components are combined and executed.
Think Like a Champion aims to enhance every aspect of a player’s form and performance. Inventive techniques, especially visualization and mental rehearsal, Dr Webster maintains, allow a physical skill to be learned more quickly and imprinted more powerfully in the mind--and thus better executed. Says ace cricketer V.V.S. Laxman, ‘These two techniques helped me to improve dramatically. Every young player should….make them an important part of his practice and preparation routine.’

To some, Naveed Mahbub is the perfect example of all that is inconsistent. But to him, life is all about gathering as many experiences as possible. So, his life’s journey takes him from being an engineer, to being a CEO, to being a stand-up comedian and then a writer. This is a part of his journey to tell one hell of a great story to his grand kids.

The fact is, life in Bangladesh is so ridiculous, that it fully deserves a chronicler of the skill and erudition of our comedian. Who else could do this thing justice?

Put together, they nonetheless show all the traits unique to his storytelling. His narrator is continuously talking to readers, preparing them for the twists and turns the stories take. When the stories begin, readers are invited to become the narrator’s co-travelers as he promises to take them through a world where the boundaries between dream and reality blur every so often. The stories are told with poise and humour in the great Bengali oral tradition. His characters come from the fringes of society as well as from the urban middle class, and are drawn with compassion, understanding and power. Their desires and deprivations, their ecstasies and frustrations are all presented in a narrative which is magical and lucid at the same time.


Syed Manzoorul Islam is perhaps the only bilingual author in Bangladesh who writes with equal ease and fluency  in both Bangla and English. He has six short story collections to his credit including Prem O Prarthonar Golpo and Ondhokar O Alo Dekhar Golpo; and five novels including Tin Porber Jibon and Dinratriguli. He received the prestigious Bangla Academy Award for literature in 1996.

As a young law graduate in Sialkot (now in Pakistan), Kudip Nayar witnessed at first hand the collapse of trust between Hindus and Muslims, and like multitude of population was forced to migrate to Delhi across the blood-stained plains of Punjab. From his perilous journey to a new country and to his first job as a young journalist in an Urdu daily, Nayar’s story is also the story of India. Widely respected for his columns, his autobiography opens on the day Pakistan resolution was passed in Lahore in 1940 and takes us on a journey through India’s story of a nation working on its foreign policy, economic reforms, relations with neighbouring countries, and dealing with coalition politics, among others. From events of historical and political relevance like the Tashkent Declaration and the 1971 war and liberation of Bangladesh, to interviewing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and from meeting Pakistan’s father of nuclear bomb, Dr A. Q. Khan, to his close association with Lal Bhahadur Shastri and Jayaprakash Narayan, Nayar’s narrative is a detailed inside view of India since 1947.",Beyond the lines An Autobiograph,Kuldip Nayar, , ,Daily Star Books,9789849027102,"2nd,2013",464,Bangladesh,English
