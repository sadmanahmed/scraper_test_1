Certain to become the definitive manual on playing and coaching cricket, this trail-blazing book represents the first time that a cricket coach and a sports scientist (both world experts in their field) have teamed up to create probably the most comprehensive book on playing and coaching cricket there is. 

The authors’ vision: to develop players who show not only technical but mental strength, and who are as physically fit and injury-resistant as possible. Much more than a coaching manual, this book reflects Bob Woolmer’s passion for constant innovation and questioning – his dedication to the art and science of cricket.

Lavishly illustrated with specially commissioned drawings and photos, the book includes useful summaries, anecdotes and tips from some of the game’s greatest players and characters.
