Youth Entrepreneurship : How To Start With....?,সৈয়দ রবিউস সামস ,TK. 200,TK. 140,https://rokomari.com//book/140524/youth-entrepreneurship---how-to-start-with-----,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/35876e7f0_140524.jpg,"Why this book?

Entrepreneurship is a thriving global phenomenon. The wave has also whipped up a storm in Bangladesh. A major portion of students and youths aspire to found a startup in the country. In this milieu, I feel there is a lack of books on the entrepreneurial ecosystem development of the country. Hence, the book titled ‘Youth Entrepreneurship: How to start with…?’ offers encouragement and empowers young readers to embrace entrepreneurship through new media presence in the present context of Bangladesh. It also sketches out the public communication activities of startups. I deem this will inspire and motivate young aspirants in their earlier stages of entrepreneurship.

This book, which has been compiled, modified and rearranged from my articles, features and news reporting published in various English and Bengali dailies and online news portals both at home and abroad since 2009, is rich with reflections on real-life experiences, rather than the typical academic and or theory based arguments. Also included are some related features on myself and my quotations from newspaper articles since 2003. There are several articles that have been printed with a focus on youth entrepreneurship and the use of social media network to promote startups in the perspective of Bangladesh.

All the writings have been written from the experiences and challenges I have faced when embarking on the path of entrepreneurship. The articles are worded in a simple English so as to be easily understandable and helpful for starting a new venture. In this series, I have tried to shed light on some contemporary examples of growing businesses and innovative ideas so that  readers can learn how ideas are generated and implemented. I have mentioned some individuals, several startups and examples of activities of various entities closely attached to entrepreneurship development. The writings display precisely the attitude  expected of students and young generations in regards to the following objectives;

1.	To spread the words of Youth Entrepreneurship and the inevitability of Digital Media on it.
 
2.	To turn out of new concepts and ideas in spawning Startups for students and youths.
3.	To assist in creating a relationship between entrepreneurs and media later this will help the entrepreneurs create an incredibly effective business network.
4.	To create a platform of young generation whose motto would be ‘Creating jobs through promoting Entrepreneurship’.

I have included articles related to entrepreneurship by some young writers who regularly contribute to various media outlets their insight on the buzzing issue. So, in a way, the book would be a great reference to get acquainted with the startup ecosystem of Bangladesh.

Speaking from my entrepreneurial experience and writings on the issue, I strongly believe that dedication and inspiration are very important parts of founding a startup for the young aspiring entrepreneur. Thus, this book would be a guide for upholding a venture with the right mindset. This could be a distinctive  standpoint of storytelling on youth Entrepreneurship and could also be a good piece of reference for various pitches. The book can teach one how to nurture one’s creativity and encourage them to take up entrepreneurship.

I assume that the first edition of this initiative is just the start of a journey. We have ways to go on the path to developing the entrepreneurial ecosystem of Bangladesh. Thus, entrepreneurship will help in the overall economic development of the country, more opportunities for businesses and creation of jobs, both local and national. If this book can contribute to boosting the confidence of the young aspiring entrepreneur by enriching his or her knowledge on entrepreneurship, it would be considered a great success for my little initiative.",Youth Entrepreneurship : How To Start With....?,Syed Rabius Shams, , ,Syed Rabius Shams,9789843423788,"2nd Printed,2018",102,Bangladesh,English
