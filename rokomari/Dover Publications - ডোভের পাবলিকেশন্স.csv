In an introductory chapter on numerical methods and their relevance to computing, well-known mathematician Richard Hamming (“the Hamming code,"" ""the Hamming distance,"" and ""Hamming window,"" etc.), suggests that the purpose of computing is insight, not merely numbers. In that connection he outlines five main ideas that aim at producing meaningful numbers that will be read and used, but will also lead to greater understanding of how the choice of a particular formula or algorithm influences not only the computing but our understanding of the results obtained.
The five main ideas involve 
(1) insuring that in computing there is an intimate connection between the source of the problem and the usability of the answers
(2) avoiding isolated formulas and algorithms in favor of a systematic study of alternate ways of doing the problem 
(3) avoidance of roundoff 
(4) overcoming the problem of truncation error 
(5) insuring the stability of a feedback system.
In this second edition, Professor Hamming (Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California) extensively rearranged, rewrote and enlarged the material. Moreover, this book is unique in its emphasis on the frequency approach and its use in the solution of problems. 
Contents include:
I. Fundamentals and Algorithms 
II. Polynomial Approximation-Classical Theory 
III. Fourier Approximation-Modern Theory 
IV. Exponential Approximation
... and more Highly regarded by experts in the field, this is a book with unlimited applications for undergraduate and graduate students of mathematics, science and engineering. Professionals and researchers will find it a valuable reference they will turn to again and again.","Numerical Methods For Scientists And Engineers,2nd Edition",Richard W.

The Taming of the Shrew,উইলিয়াম শেক্সপীয়ার,"",TK. 270,https://rokomari.com//book/155664/the-taming-of-the-shrew,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/05e0c20ea_155664.jpg,"""The Taming of the Shrew:
A rough-and-tumble farce centered around a lively battle of the sexes, The Taming of the Shrew brims with action and bawdy humor. The unconventional romance between a lusty fortune-hunter and a bitter shrew unfolds to the accompaniment of witty, fast-paced dialogue and physical humor in this excellent introduction to Shakespearean comedy.
The freebooter Petruchio arrives in Padua to hear of Katharina, a beautiful heiress whose waspish rants and caustic personality have repelled all attempts at courtship. Professing to admire a woman of spirit, Petruchio immediately sets about his wooing. The initial encounter between “Kate"" and her wily suitor is spiked with impassioned exchanges of blows as well as jests. After a madcap wedding ceremony, the still-protesting Kate is whisked away to be “killed with kindness"" and reborn as a loving wife.
One of the Bard's earliest and most popular plays, The Taming of the Shrew is rife with subplots involving his customary devices of disguise and mistaken identity. The vivid language, studded with elaborate puns, is an engaging complement to the play's slapstick humor. Reprinted complete and unabridged in this inexpensive edition, The Taming of the Shrew will delight any reader with its wonderful wordplay and rollicking good spirits.
