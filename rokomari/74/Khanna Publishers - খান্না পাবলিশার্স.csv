Sewage disposal deals with the collection and systems of transporting sewage to sewage treatment plants in order to protect public health and prevent the outbreak of diseases. Air pollution engineering has two major aspects, air pollution control and air quality engineering. Air pollution control is aimed at the identification and prevention of emissions that pollute the air while air quality engineering deals with the large-scale and varied control strategies that focus on the physical and chemical aspects of the interactions of pollutants in the atmosphere.

Environmental Engineering: Sewage Disposal And Air Pollution Engineering (Volume - 2) explains to the reader in detail the techniques related to the treatment of wastewater with reference to water pollution. It also discusses the disposal of solid wastes including hazardous radioactive and bio-medical wastes covering the topic of land pollution. Furthermore, the reader is also introduced to the various types of air pollutants, their harmful effects such as global warming, ozone layer depletion and acid rains and the technological methods being used in controlling air pollution. The book also discusses the impact of mining and thermal power plants on the environment.

Environmental Engineering: Sewage Disposal And Air Pollution Engineering (Volume - 2) is divided into 28 chapters and has a bank of over 600 questions along with the answer key. These questions are the ones that a student is most likely to come across in the Engineering Services competitive exams and the AMIE exam. It is a handy reference for students in the fields of civil, environmental and chemical engineering
