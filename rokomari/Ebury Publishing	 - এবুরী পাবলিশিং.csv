Man’s Search for Meaning was first published in German in 1946, just one year after the end of the Second World War and the liberation of its author, psychologist Viktor Emil Frankl, from a Nazi concentration camp. With its exhortation to each individual to find the meaning in his or her life, Frankl’s combined memoir and psychological treatise—first translated into English in 1959—has become one of the most influential books of the twentieth century.

Frankl’s book consists of two long essays and a short postscript added in 1984. The first essay, “Experiences in a Concentration Camp,” details the author’s experiences and observations while imprisoned in several different concentration camps, paying particular attention to how finding meaning in even the most dire of circumstances allowed him and others to survive. The second essay, “Logotherapy in a Nutshell,” describes the basic principles of Frankl’s meaning-centered therapeutic practice. The postscript, “The Case for a Tragic Optimism,” explores the idea of “saying yes to life in spite of everything.”(enotes.com)",Mans Search For Meaning,Viktor E.

My olympic Journey (50 of India's Leading Sportspersons on the Biggest Test of Their Career),দিগভিজায় সিং দিয়ো ,"",TK. 538,https://rokomari.com//book/132440/my-olympic-journey--50-of-india-s-leading-sportspersons-on-the-biggest-test-of-their-career-,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/e46d2420a_132440.jpg,"'My olympic Journey' Summary of the book
Authored by broadcast sports journalists Digvijay Singh Deo and Amit Bose, the book has 50 top Olympians narrating their own story. It makes the collection interesting and so much authentic and readable.

Some of the experiences of theses sportspersons are revealing and never heard before. For instance, celebrated boxer and Beijing Olympic medallist Vijender Singh revealed how his sole aim was to become the national champion so that he could get a job in Police or Army. No doubt, it is the hard reality of Indian sport that everyone knows but that coming from Vijender — now when he is an icon of Indian sport — means a lot. 
Anjali Bhagwat, who is considered a pioneer of Indian shooting, has a similar tale to share. Even after becoming a national champion she had to share a solitary rifle with ten other girls! She goes on to recount how actor Nana Patekar sponsored her first shooting kit.

Then there are personal anecdotes. For instance, how badminton ace Ashwinin Ponnappa met tennis superstar Novak Djokovic — revealing the human side of a star herself.

For India’s solitary individual Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra, the post-medal celebrations were no better than a 'tamasha'. On his golden deed at Beijing Bindra recalls, ""I had even anticipated the hysteria that followed, but I did not want to have anything to do with it. I hated every moment of the 'tamasha' that followed.""

Hockey wizard Dhyan Chand’s son Ashok has an interesting story to share. He relates an emotional experience during Munich Olympics. He met a man who was brought on a stretcher to the ground. This man simply wanted to share with Ashok that he had seen his father Dhyan Chand playing during the Berlin Olympics in 1936. This, perhaps, could be the best anecdote of the 327-page book brought out by Penguin.

Yogeshwar Dutt saying that he has never met Leander Paes is also a very interesting revelation of the book and an honest confession by the Olympic wrestling bronze medallist.

No book on Indians in Olympics is complete without the 'Flying Sikh' Milkha Singh. And so much is written on the Rome Olympic star that it is difficult to get anything new. But Digvijay and Amit have managed to churn out stories about how he held conversation with American sprinter Charlie Jenkins without knowing a word of the English language.

The fact that the two authors could get so much out of these Indian superstars is because of Digvijay’s experience of covering the Olympics, Asian and Commonwealth Games. His personal equation with athletes has also helped him a great deal.

The loans were so enormous that they couldn’t be easily paid back, handing US the reins to the countries’ decisions on several foreign policies. The United States, he claims, has been misusing this power to cripple these nations politically and made the wealth gap wider, driving the economy of these countries lower. He explains that economic hit men have been used by the US to funnel money from the World Bank, the USAID and other foreign aid companies into the pockets of a few wealthy families. These families, he professes, control most of the world’s natural resources, and they spare no risks in rigging elections, making up fraudulent financial reports, payoffs, extortion, sex and murder. This is a controversial book by Perkins, and its authority has been challenged by journalists from around the world.",Confessions Of An Economic Hit Man,John Perkins, , ,Ebury Publishing,9780091909109,"1st Edition,2006",272,USA,English
