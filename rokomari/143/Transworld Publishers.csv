Born into one of Pakistan's most influential families, Tehmina Durrani was raised in the privileged milieu of Lahore high society. Like all women of her rank, she was expected to marry a prosperous Muslim from a respectable family, bear him many children and lead a sheltered life of leisure. 

Her marriage to Mustafa Khar, one of Pakistan's most eminent political figures, soon turned into a nightmare. Violently possessive and pathologically jealous, Mustafa Khar succeeded in cutting her off from the outside world. For fourteen years, Tehmina suffered alone, in silence. 

When she decided to rebel, the price she paid was extremely high: as a Muslim woman seeking a divorce, she signed away all financial support, lost the custody of her four children, and found herself alienated from her friends and disowned by her parents. 

When this book was first published it shook Pakistani society to its foundations. Here at last was someone who had succeded in reconciling her faith in Islam with her ardent belief in women's rights. Tehmina Durrani's story provided extraordinary insights into the vulnerable position of women caught in the complex web of Muslim society.",My Feudal Lord,Tehmina Durrani, , ,Transworld Publishers,9780552142397,"New edition,1996",384,India,English

From Ed Catmull, co-founder (with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter) of Pixar Animation Studios, comes an incisive book about creativity in business—sure to appeal to readers of Daniel Pink, Tom Peters, and Chip and Dan Heath. Creativity, Inc. is a book for managers who want to lead their employees to new heights, a manual for anyone who strives for originality, and the first-ever, all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar Animation—into the meetings, postmortems, and “Braintrust” sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is, at heart, a book about how to build a creative culture—but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.” For nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the Toy Story trilogy, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, and WALL-E, which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really is. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired—and so profitable.
 
As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his founding Pixar with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter in 1986. Nine years later, Toy Story was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie’s success—and in the thirteen movies that followed—was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as:
 
• Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better.
• If you don’t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead. 
• It’s not the manager’s job to prevent risks. It’s the manager’s job to make it safe for others to take them.
• The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them. 
• A company’s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody.
• Do not assume that general agreement will lead to change—it takes substantial energy to move a group, even when all are on board.

Set in the Bangladeshi part of East London, this book tells the story of two Bangladeshi sisters. Nazneen is married to a husband she doesn’t love, and she struggles with her own desires. Hasina is prettier than her sister, and she eloped with a lover. Nazneen’s husband is much older than her, and he lives in London. Nazneen didn’t speak much English, and her initial tribulations center around her discomfort with her new life and her loveless marriage. Hasina writes to her about her life, and Nazneen becomes jealous. After several years, Nazneen has two daughters and she still feels no love in her marriage. Twelve years after she first arrived in London, she begins a fiery affair with a man named Karim and she begins to find the voice she never had to speak up and say what her heart desires. But sometimes, duty is more important than desires. Can Nazneen choose between her responsibilities as a dutiful wife and her desires as a woman in need of love?

The Fist Of God is the name assigned to a supergun designed by Dr. Gerald Bull. He has designed it, he thinks, for launching Arab satellites into space. His launcher could not have any military value because once it is used, its location can be easily pinpointed, and so, it cannot be kept concealed as a military weapon. Once he completes his mission, Dr. Bull is assassinated. Shortly before his death, he realizes the true purpose of the launching equipment he has designed. But, he is silenced before he could alert the outside world to a possible threat.

Meanwhile, in the gathering tension preceding the launch of the western offensive against Iraq, a British officer of the Special Air Services (SAS) is assigned to work with the Iraqi resistance. Besides his special training and experience, he has other valuable assets for this operation. Major Mike Martin can speak Arabic fluently, and with his dark skin and dark hair, combined with his command over the language, he is easily able to pass of as an Arab. Mike’s brother Terry, an expert on the military affairs of the region, also gets involved with the Allied operations.

Terry Martin is appointed as an advisor to the joint Anglo-American panel, the Medusa Committee, investigating the true military potential of Iraq. The panel finds that the country does not have any seriously threatening biological arsenal as feared. They also decide that with its limited resources, the country also has not been able to develop weapon-grade Uranium to create nuclear weapons. So, the experts of the committee decide that the main threat from Iraq is their Gas Weapons.

But unexpected events and discoveries lead to a mission in which a weapon’s factory needs to be destroyed. For this purpose, Major Martin and an elite team under his command enter Iraq in secret. They have just two days to find and destroy the weapons factory before the launch of the allied offensive. They also have to prevent The Fist of God from being used for its destined purpose.

Jack Reacher is an ex-military official and a wanderer. A man without any baggage or belongings, he takes up strange jobs on a part-time basis and keeps roaming around, exploring his country. In 61 Hours, Jack is on a bus that veers and crashes in a snowstorm near a small town in South Dakota. The town of Bolton happens to be one of the biggest prisons in the country, and for this very reason, it places a full demand on law enforcement resources. Forced to stay on for a few days in Bolton, Jack soon gets drawn into various affairs of the little town, the biggest being a forthcoming drugs trial. The trial involves a leader of a biker gang, who has been detained on a drug transaction charge. The chief witness, a woman, is in severe jeopardy, as the drug mafia does not want her to appear in court against them. Inexperienced and desperately in need of help, the local police hand over the task of protecting the woman to Jack. Will he be able to save her or run into more danger? Find out what happens to both Jack and the lady in this unputdownable page-turner.
