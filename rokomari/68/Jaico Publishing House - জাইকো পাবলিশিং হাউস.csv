The Greatest Salesman in the World is a book, written by Og Mandino, that serves as a guide to a philosophy of salesmanship, and success, telling the story of Hafid, a poor camel boy who achieves a life of abundance. The book was first published in 1968, and re-issued in 1983 by Bantam. A hardcover edition was published by Buccaneer Books in June, 1993. In 1970, Success Motivation Institute purchased the rights to produce the audio recording.

If Mandino's suggested reading structure is followed, it would take about 10 months to read the book.

The instructions are to read Scroll I (Chapter 8) three times a day for thirty days straight. Only after completing the thirty days of reading Scroll I, should you continue to Scroll II (Chapter 9) and so forth through Scroll X (Chapter 17). 
Mandino composed The Legend Of The Ten Scrolls. They are:

Scroll I - I will Form Good Habits and Become their Slave
Scroll II - Greet Each Day With Love In Your Heart
Scroll III - I Will Persist Until I Succeed
Scroll IV - I am Nature's Greatest Miracle
Scroll V - Live Each Day as if it Were Your Last
Scroll VI - Master Your Emotions
Scroll VII - The Power of Laughter
Scroll VIII - Multiply Your Value Every Day
Scroll IX - All is Worthless Without Action
Scroll X - Pray to God for Guidance
His primary message was to ""do it now"". In the marking of Scroll IX, ""I will act now"" is written 18 times. While his messages did have Christian undertones (by referring to Paul as the greatest salesman in the world), it was still a message of repetitive actions to build good habits.

Actor Matthew McConaughey cited this book as having changed his life. The book is also recommended by Tariq Jameel, who says that the book should be read by everyone looking for success in his life.[",The Greatest Salesman In The World,OG Mandino, , ,Jaico Publishing House,9788179926871,"21th Impression,2017",90,India,English

About the Author 
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) was born in Edinburgh. A doctor by profession, it was while waiting for patients that he began to write. An infracaninophile, he was a man of varied interests. His creation of Sherlock Holmes was, however, his greatest achievement. The exploits of this sharp sleuth and his companion in adventure and chronicler, Dr. Watson, soon catapulted Doyle to international status. A prolific writer, he has written four novels and 56 short stories.",The Complete Short Stories of Sherlock Holmes,Sir Arthur Connan Doyle, , ,Jaico Publishing House,9788172240608,"33th Impression,2016",764,India,English

Passed down by Buddhist Monks, the Jataka tales tell stories of the First Bodhisattva, Goutama Buddha, in his previous lives. The stories reveal how not even the Enlightened One is an exception to the eternal cycle of life and death, and show the importance of various morals through the actions of animals. They teach readers about values such as kindness, forgiveness, sharing, gratitude and honesty. There is wisdom in the world of animals, the Buddha reveals, and this wisdom will allow everyone to ascend to greatness through acts of kindness and humanity.
