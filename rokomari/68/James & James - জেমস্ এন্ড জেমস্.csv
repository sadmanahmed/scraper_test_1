To some, the term encompasses innovation, change and commitment to the future and to others it means preservation, conservatism and a watchful eye on the future. City Fights follows on from the symposium 'Energy and Urban Strategies', which brought together contributors from a wide variety of disciplines, with the aim of developing sharp ideas about making better and more sustainable cities in environmental, social and economic terms. The result is a passionate and illuminating debate on this vast question, bringing into focus the complexity and diversity of the issues involved. City fights is essential and thought provoking reading for all with a common interest in the future of the city- from architects and urban designers, urban and town planners and policy makers, to academics and researchers, sociologists, environmentalists and economists.",City Fights: Debates on Urban Sustainability,"Susannah Hagan,Mark Hewitt", , ,James & James,9781902916170,2001,136,India,English
