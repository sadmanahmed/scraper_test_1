Starting off as roommates purely for the sake of convenience, Watson soon becomes Holmes’ most trusted confidante and friend, accompanying him on all his cases. In Doyle’s second novel,The Sign Of Four, Watson embarks on a matrimonial alliance and moves out. Subsequent to the two novels are a series of 36 short stories, including The Adventure of the Speckled Band, The Musgrave Ritual, and The Five Orange Pips, founded on miscellaneous themes, from murder mysteries to love intrigues, blackmail, kidnappers, beasts and monsters, etc.

As the stories were initially featured in magazines, the chronology of events is slightly ambiguous. Many of the stories are narrated as Watson’s reminiscences of his sleuthing days with Holmes prior to his marriage, but quite unexpectedly, Watson moves back in with Holmes with no allusion to his wife. The Final Problem intended as Holmes last case, ends with the death of Sherlock Holmes. Sir Arthur’s desire regarding the end of the great detective, however, had to be abandoned due to public disquiet, and thus Holmes was resurrected in The Adventures of the Empty House.
  
Published in 1986 by Random House Publishing Group, the book has good print and a very clear typset. Sherlock Holmes stories have been popular for decades and have received laudatory reviews world over.


About Arthur Conan Doyle


Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a physician and an author of Scottish-Irish origin, who was nicknamed the Father of Crime, for acquainting with the world with detective fiction.


Some of his opuses are The Mystery of Cloomber, Professor Challenger’s The Lost World, The Land of Mist, and The Edge of the Unknown.
Arthur Conan Doyle never limited himself to crime fiction, since his intellect extended to other subjects as well. He wrote plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction and historical novels.


Conan Doyle’s language was effusive with a generous use of adjectives, in exquisitely well structured sentences. His books generally embodied a Victorian setting and his eloquent language befitted the classic literature of its time.


Born on May 22, 1859, in Edinburgh, Scotland, Conan Doyle began writing while studying medicine in University of Edinburgh. After working in Aston, Sheffield and Shropshire, working as a surgeon on a ship, and teaming up with his former classmate as his partner in medical practice, he eventually set up his own at Southsea. He wrote his first novel and compiled a collection of short stories while awaiting his clientele. By 1902, his writings had reached such heights as to award him the kudos of Knight Bachelor. He was a great supporter of spiritualism and was for a time friends with Houdini. He married twice and fathered five children, two from his first marriage, and three from his second. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle suffered a heart attack and passed away in 1930.

""...clearly possesses a natural teacher's gifts - easy, good-natured humor and an ability to illustrate highly complex propositions with analogies plucked from daily life.”
THE NEW YORK TIMES 
STEPHEN HAWKING is widely believed to be one of the world's greatest minds: a brilliant theoretical physicist whose work helped to reconfigure models of the universe and to redefine what's in it. Imagine sitting in a room listening to Hawking discuss these achievements and place them in historical context. It would be like hearing Christopher Columbus on the New World.
Hawking presents a series of seven lectures - covering everything from big bang to black holes to string theory – that capture not only the brilliance of Hawking's mind but his characteristic wit as well. Of his research on black holes, which absorbed him for more than a decade, he says, “It might seem a bit like looking for a black cat in a coal cellar.”
Hawking begins with a history of ideas about the universe, from Aristotle's determination that the Earth is round to Hubble's discovery, over 2000 years later, that the universe is expanding. Using that as a launching pad, he explores the reaches of modern physics, including theories on the origin of the universe (e.g., the big bang), the nature of black holes, and space-time. Finally, he poses the questions left unanswered by modern physics, especially how to combine all the partial theories into a “unified theory of everything.” “If we find the answer to that,” he claims, “it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason.""
A great popularizer of science as well as a brilliant scientist, Hawking believes that advances in theoretical science should be ""understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists.” In this book, he offers a fascinating voyage of discovery about the cosmos and our place in it. It is a book for anyone who has ever gazed at the night sky and wondered what was up there and how it came to be.",The Theory of Everything (The Origin and Fate of Universe) (With CD),Stephen Hawking, , ,Jaico Books India,9788179927939,"1st Edition,2008",132,Abroad,English

The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian is the 1951 autobiography of Nirad C. Chaudhuri, an Indian writer.[1][2] Written when he was around 50, it records his life from his birth in 1897 in Kishorganj, a small town in present-day Bangladesh. The book relates his mental and intellectual development, his life and growth in Calcutta, his observations of vanishing landmarks, the connotation of this is dual—changing Indian situation and historical forces that was making exit of British from India an imminent affair.

The book is divided into four books, each of which consists of a preface and four chapters. The first book is entitled ""Early Environment"" and its four chapters are: 1) My Birth Place , 2) My Ancestral Place, 3) My mother's Place and 4) England.

Nirad, a self-professed Anglophile, is in any situation an explosive proposition and in the book he is at his best in observing as well as observing-at-a-distance and this dual perspective makes it a wonderful reading. His treatment of his childhood, his enchantment, disillusionment and gratitude to the colonial capital Calcutta is highly factual as well as artistic to the extent highly readable.

Arguably, his magnum opus considering his literary output that he could generate as late age as ninety years, Autobiography is not a single book, it is many. Consciously or unconsciously he has left traces of all his erudition, his spirit and learning. Declaring himself a cartographer of learning, the book is also a cartographic evidence of the author's mind and its varied geographies, of the map as well as of the mind.",The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian,Niradchondro Chaudhuri, , ,Jaico Books India,9788172242879,"35th Impression,2016",570,India,English

'The Greatest Short Stories of Leo Tolstoy' Summary of the Book

Leo Tolstoy believed in a strong moral foundation. His writing is constantly imbued with a didactic nature and his short stories are a strong example of this. Tolstoy is celebrated to this day for his short stories, and this collection brings together some of his most memorable stories. In How Much Land Does a Man Need?, an avaricious man makes a deal with the Devil. In God Sees the Truth But Waits, an innocent man is convicted of a murder he did not commit and goes on to become a mediator among his fellow prisoners. In A Prisoner in the Caucasus, Tolstoy’s favourite story, an old man tries to barter the lives of two Russian soldiers for the life of his captive son. In Ivan the Fool, a naïve young man must bolster his struggling family's fortunes together with his mute sister. These and several other stories demonstrate Tolstoy’s penchant for a life full of love, respect and devotion for the truth.

Here is the legend of Hafid, a camel boy of two thousand years ago, and his burning desire to improve his lowly position in life. To prove his potential ability, he is dispatched from Bethlehem by his master, the great caravan merchant, Pathros, to sell only one robe. He fails and instead, in a moment of pity, gives the robe to warm a newborn baby in a cave near the inn.
Hafid returns to the caravan in shame but is accompanied by a bright star shining above his head. This phenomenon is interpreted by Pathros to be a sign from the gods, and he gives Hafid ten ancient scrolls, which contain the wisdom necessary for the boy to achieve all his ambitions.
This timeless story also presents the complete writings from the original scrolls.

How can one be a leader? The Leader Who Had No Title (With CD) provides insights into such questions, thus portraying the basic needs to be a good and popular leader.

Robin S. Sharma has used a story to explain his theories and ideology. Blake Davis, a character in the book, is an employee in a bookstore. He learns the skills of leadership from five different people. First, he meets Tommy, who shows him how a person without any title can be a leader. He also explains the ten human regrets and ten human victories that differentiate between an average life and an exceptional life.
Tommy introduces Blake to four people who inform him what leadership is all about. The group includes Anna, a member of the housekeeping staff of a star hotel, Ty Boyd, a ski champion, Jackson Chan, a successful businessman, and Jet Brisley, a massage therapist. All four give Blake acronyms. These acronyms define the concept of leadership through different principles.

Slowly, Blake realizes that in order to be a leader, one must lead himself and develop his own thoughts and actions. Innovation and thinking must be brought in, as a leader must never behave like a subordinate. He must build his own image and thereby explore beyond his capabilities.
The principles of becoming a good leader become clearer to him as the book progresses. The Leader Who Had No Title (With CD) covers skills that involve handling responsibilities like building relationships, finding one’s strong points, and finally becoming a stronger person, and proves that to be a good leader, you do not require any title.

There are only two types of people: Mystics and mistakes,"" says Sadhguru. This book is an invitation to a journey -- from a life of mechanical autopilot to a life of freedom and grace. Sharp, piercing, and unsparing, what it represents is mysticism demystified. Above all, this is a book that offers signposts on a journey that can so often be a bewildering one.

Mysticism, Sadhguru tells us in the very first chapter, has nothing to do with thinking about God, yearning for salvation, or even attaining peace. Mysticism is, instead, a journey for those willing to take risks, for those willing to travel beyond the limited and unreliable matrix of logic and the five senses, for those willing to open their doors and windows and let sunlight in.
