The book surveys the history of humankind from the evolution of archaic human species in the Stone Age up to the twenty-first century, focusing on Homo sapiens. The account is situated within a framework provided by the natural sciences, particularly evolutionary biology.
Harari's work situates its account of human history within a framework provided by the natural sciences, particularly evolutionary biology: he sees biology as setting the limits of possibility for human activity, and sees culture as shaping what happens within those bounds. The academic discipline of history is the account of cultural change.

Harari surveys the history of humankind from the evolution of archaic human species in the Stone Age up to the twenty-first century, focusing on Homo sapiens. He divides the history of Sapiens into four major parts:

The Cognitive Revolution (c. 70,000 BC, when Sapiens evolved imagination).
The Agricultural Revolution (c. 10,000 BC, the development of agriculture).
The unification of humankind (the gradual consolidation of human political organisations towards one global empire).
The Scientific Revolution (c. 1500 AD, the emergence of objective science).
Harari's main argument is that Sapiens came to dominate the world because it is the only animal that can cooperate flexibly in large numbers. He argues that prehistoric Sapiens were a key cause of the extinction of other human species such as the Neanderthals, along with numerous other megafauna. He further argues that the ability of Sapiens to cooperate in large numbers arises from its unique capacity to believe in things existing purely in the imagination, such as gods, nations, money, and human rights. Harari claims that all large-scale human cooperation systems – including religions, political structures, trade networks, and legal institutions – owe their emergence to Sapiens' distinctive cognitive capacity for fiction.[5] Accordingly, Harari regards money as a system of mutual trust and sees political and economic systems as more or less identical with religions.",Sapiens A Brief History Of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari, , ,Vintage Books,9780099590088,"1st Published,2014",498,India,English

His father`s dark prophecy.

a bizarre childhood affliction finds his pleasantly simplified life
Suddenly turned upside down. 
As their parallel odysseys unravel, cats converse with people, fish

World War II. There is a savage killing, but the identity of both
Victim and killer is a riddle – one of many which combine to create
An elegant and dreamlike masterpiece.

War and Peace begins in the Russian city of St. Petersburg in 1805, as fear of Napoleon’s ongoing war making begins to set in. Most of the characters are introduced at a party, including Pierre Bezukhov, Andrey Bolkonsky, and the Kuragin and Rostov families. Much of the novel focuses on the interactions between the Bezukhovs, Bolkonskys, and the Rostovs. After their introduction, Andrey Bolkonsky and Nikolay Rostov go to the Austrian front under General Kutuzov, a fictional representation of Mikhail Kutuzov, to engage with Napoleon’s troops. Andrey is then injured at the Battle of Austerlitz and presumed dead, until he arrives home to his wife, Lise, who dies during childbirth soon after. Pierre, meanwhile, has married Helene Kuragina. She is unfaithful to him, and Pierre duels with the other man, almost killing him. He soon becomes overwhelmed by his marriage and leaves Helene. He joins the Freemasons, which influences his personal and business fortunes greatly. In the meantime Nikolay has racked up a large amount of gambling debt, which causes the Rostov family to lose most of their fortune. He is encouraged to marry a wealthy heiress, despite promising to marry Sonya, his cousin. Nikolay eventually witnesses the peace between Tsar Alexander I and Napoleon (Treaties of Tilsit, signed in 1807). Andrey soon becomes involved with Natasha Rostov only to be told by his father that he must wait a year before marrying her. After some time away, Andrey discovers that Natasha has been unfaithful. He rejects her, and Pierre consoles her, eventually falling in love with her.

In 1812 Napoleon invades Russia, forcing Alexander to declare war. Andrey returns to service, and Pierre is driven to believe he must personally assassinate Napoleon. As the French advance, Mary, Lise’s sister, is forced to leave her house. Nikolay finds her in the streets, and the two reconnect. Pierre, still crazed by his imaginary duty, is apprehended by French forces and witnesses a number of executions, which deeply affect him. During his imprisonment, he befriends Platon Karatev, a wise peasant. He is later freed from the French and promptly falls ill. After recovering, he marries Natasha, and they have four children together.

Midnight's Children is a loose allegory for events in India both before and, primarily, after the independence and partition of India. The protagonist and narrator of the story is Saleem Sinai, born at the exact moment when India became an independent country. He was born with telepathic powers, as well as an enormous and constantly dripping nose with an extremely sensitive sense of smell. The novel is divided into three books.

The book begins with the story of the Sinai family, particularly with events leading up to India's Independence and Partition. Saleem is born precisely at midnight, 15 August 1947, therefore, exactly as old as independent India. He later discovers that all children born in India between 12 a.m. and 1 a.m. on that date are imbued with special powers. Saleem, using his telepathic powers, assembles a Midnight Children's Conference, reflective of the issues India faced in its early statehood concerning the cultural, linguistic, religious, and political differences faced by a vastly diverse nation. Saleem acts as a telepathic conduit, bringing hundreds of geographically disparate children into contact while also attempting to discover the meaning of their gifts. In particular, those children born closest to the stroke of midnight wield more powerful gifts than the others. Shiva ""of the Knees"", Saleem's nemesis, and Parvati, called ""Parvati-the-witch,"" are two of these children with notable gifts and roles in Saleem's story.

Meanwhile, Saleem's family begin a number of migrations and endure the numerous wars which plague the subcontinent. During this period he also suffers amnesia until he enters a quasi-mythological exile in the jungle of Sundarban, where he is re-endowed with his memory. In doing so, he reconnects with his childhood friends. Saleem later becomes involved with the Indira Gandhi-proclaimed Emergency and her son Sanjay's ""cleansing"" of the Jama Masjid slum. For a time Saleem is held as a political prisoner; these passages contain scathing criticisms of Indira Gandhi's over-reach during the Emergency as well as a personal lust for power bordering on godhood. The Emergency signals the end of the potency of the Midnight Children, and there is little left for Saleem to do but pick up the few pieces of his life he may still find and write the chronicle that encompasses both his personal history and that of his still-young nation, a chronicle written for his son, who, like his father, is both chained and supernaturally endowed by history.",Midnights Children (Man Booker Prize),Salman Rushdie, , ,Vintage Books,9780099578512,"1st Published,2006",650,Abroad,English

Preface
Archer Blood, the United States’ consul general in Dacca, was a gentlemanly diplomat raised in Virginia, a World War II navy veteran in the upswing of a promising Foreign Service career after several tours overseas. He was earnest and precise, known to some of his more unruly subordinates at the U.S. consulate as a good, conventional man. 
He had come to like his posting to this impoverished, green, and swampy land. But outside of the consulate's grimy offices, in the steamy heat, the city was dying. Night after night, Blood heard the gunshots. On the night of March 25, 1971, the Pakistan army had begun a relentless crackdown on Bengalis, all across what was then East Pakistan and is today an independent Bangladesh. Untold thousands of people were shot, bombed, or burned to death in Dacca alone. Blood had spent that grim night on the roof of his official residence, watching as tracer bullets lit up the sky, listening to clattering machine guns and thumping tank guns. There were fires across the ramshackle city. He knew the people in the deathly darkness below. He liked them. Many of the civilians facing the bullets were professional colleagues; some were his friends. 
It was, Blood and his staffers thought, their job to relay as much of this as they possibly could back to Washington. Witnessing one of the worst atrocities of the Cold War, Blood's consulate documented in horrific detail the slaughter of Bengali civilians: an area the size of two dozen city blocks that had been razed by gunfire; two newspaper office buildings in ruins; thatch-roofed villages in flames; specific targeting of the Bengalis' Hindu minority. 
The U.S. consulate gave detailed accounts of the killings at Dacca University, ordinarily a leafy, handsome enclave. At the wrecked campus, professors had been hauled from their homes to be gunned down.


The provost of the Hindu dormitory, a respected scholar of English, was dragged out of his residence and shot in the neck. Blood listed six other faculty members ""reliably reported killed by troops,"" with several more possibly dead. One American who had visited the campus said that students had been ""mowed down” in their rooms or as they fled, with a residence hall in flames and youths being machine-gunned.""
""At least two mass graves on campus,” Blood cabled. ""Stench terrible.” There were 148 corpses in one of these mass graves, according to the workmen forced to dig them. An official in the Dacca consulate estimated that at least five hundred students had been killed in the first two days of the crackdown, almost none of them fighting back. Blood reckoned that the rumored toll of a thousand dead at the university was ""exaggerated, although nothing these days is inconceivable.” After the massacre, he reported that an American eyewitness had seen an empty army truck arriving to get rid of a ""tightly packed pile of approximately twenty five corpses,” the last of many such batches of human remains.
THIS WAS, BLOOD KNEW, THE LAST THING HIS SUPERIORS IN Washington wanted to hear. Pakistan was an ally-a military dictatorship, but fiercely anticommunist. Blood detailed how Pakistan was using U.S. weapons-tanks, jet fighters, gigantic troop transport airplanes, jeeps, guns, ammunition-to crush the Bengalis. In one of the awkward alignments of the Cold War, President Richard Nixon had lined up the democratic United States with this authoritarian government, while the despots in the Soviet Union found themselves standing behind democratic India. 
Nixon and Henry Kissinger, the brilliant White House national security advisor, were driven not just by such Cold War calculations, but a starkly personal and emotional dislike of India and Indians. Nixon enjoyed his friendship with Pakistan's military dictator, General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan, known as Yahya, who was helping to set up the top secret opening to China. The White House did not want to be seen as doing anything that might hint at the breakup of Pakistan-no matter what was happening to civilians in the east wing of Pakistan. 
The onslaught would continue for months. The Dacca consulate stubbornly kept up its reporting. But, Blood later recalled, his cables were met with ""a deafening silence.” He was not allowed to protest to the Pakistani authorities. He ratcheted up his dispatches, sending in a blistering cable tagged ""Selective Genocide,” urging his bosses to speak out against the atrocities being committed by the Pakistani military. The White House staff passed this up to Kissinger, who paid no heed. Then on April 6, two weeks into the slaughter, Blood and almost his entire consulate sent in a telegram formally declaring their ""strong dissent""-a total repudiation of the policy that they were there to carry out. That cable-perhaps the most radical rejection of U.S. policy ever sent by its diplomats-blasted the United States for silence in the face of atrocities, for not denouncing the quashing of democracy, for showing “moral bankruptcy” in the face of what they bluntly called genocide.
THIS BOOK ISABOUT HOW TWO OF THE WORLD'S GREAT DEMOCRACIESthe United States and India-faced up to one of the most terrible humanitarian crises of the twentieth century. The slaughter in what is now Bangladesh stands as one of the cardinal moral challenges of recent history, although today it is far more familiar to South Asians than to Americans. It had a monumental impact on India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh-almost a sixth of humanity in 1971. In the dark annals of modern cruelty, it ranks as bloodier than Bosnia and by some accounts in the same rough league as Rwanda. It was a defining moment for both the United States and India, where their humane principles were put to the test.
"" For the United States, as Archer Blood understood, a small number of atrocities are so awful that they stand outside of the normal day-today flow of diplomacy: the Armenian genocide, the Holocaust, Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda. When we think of U.S. leaders failing the test of decency in such moments, we usually think of uncaring disengagement: Franklin Roosevelt fighting World War II without taking serious steps to try to rescue Jews from the Nazi dragnet, or Bill Clinton standing idly by during the Rwandan genocide. 
But Pakistan's slaughter of its Bengalis in 1971 is starkly different. Here the United States was allied with the killers. The White House was actively and knowingly supporting a murderous regime at many of the most crucial moments. There was no question about whether the United States should intervene; it was already intervening on behalf of a military dictatorship decimating its own people. 
This stands as one of the worst moments of moral blindness in U.S. foreign policy. Pakistan's crackdown on the Bengalis was not routine or small-scale killing, not something that could be dismissed as business as usual, but a colossal and systematic onslaught. Midway through the bloodshed, both the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department conservatively estimated that about two hundred thousand people had lost their lives. Many more would perish, cut down by Pakistani forces or dying in droves in miserable refugee camps. ""The story of East Bengal will surely be written as one of the greatest nightmares of modern times,” declared Edward Kennedy, who led the outcry in the Senate. But in the depths of the Cold War, Nixon and Kissinger were unyielding in their support for Pakistan, making possible horrific crimes against humanity-plausibly even a genocide-in that country's eastern wing.
"" The ongoing Bengali slaughter led within a few months to a major war between Pakistan and India. In that time, the White House had every opportunity to grasp how bad these atrocities were. There were sober misgivings voiced in the White House, and thunderous protests from the State Department and its emissaries in Delhi and Dacca, with Archer Blood the loudest voice of all. But throughout it all, from the outbreak of civil war to the Bengali massacres to Pakistan's crushing defeat by the Indian military, Nixon and Kissinger, unfazed by detailed knowledge of the massacres, stood stoutly behind Pakistan. 
As its most important international backer, the United States had great influence over Pakistan. But at almost every turning point in the crisis, Nixon and Kissinger failed to use that leverage to avert disaster. Before the shooting started, they consciously decided not to warn Pakistan's military chiefs against using violence on their own population. They did not urge caution or impose conditions that might have discouraged the Pakistani military government from butchering its own citizenry. They did not threaten the loss of U.S. support or even sanctions if Pakistan took the wrong course. They allowed the army to sweep aside the results of Pakistan's first truly free and fair democratic election, without even suggesting that the military strongmen try to work out a power-sharing deal with the Bengali leadership that had won the vote. They did not ask that Pakistan refrain from using U.S. weaponry to slaughter civilians, even though that could have impeded the military's rampage, and might have deterred the army. There was no public condemnation-nor even a private threat of it-from the president, the secretary of state, or other senior officials. The administration almost entirely contented itself with making gentle, token suggestions.....",The Blood Telegram: Indias Secret War in East Pakistan,Gary J.

It was roughly at that point of time that a breaking off happened, which slowly led to the evolution of societies and groups. Gradually, people started getting involved in farming and rearing numerous plants and animals in parts of Eurasia and parts of the Americas. There was a gradual rise of planters and animal domesticators. It can be learnt from the book that the people who got rid of other race groups and resorted to measures like conquest, removal, and replacements are the ones who had advanced in the paths of becoming civilized and improved groups. The road which started from searching for food in random places and ended in proper organized living was greatly affected by the weather and the topography too. But, there remains the curiosity as to how the segregation occurred and how various cultures and traditions came into being.

It is also unclear why the Australians, Americans, or Africans did not rule over Europe. The author, Diamond, reveals that the various explanations about racial activities whose reasons are often traced back to cultural divisions are actually the reason of biological separations. He comes up with valuable instances and proofs that there was a relation between germs and living beings’ civilization and also goes on to discuss the ways in which germs got scattered in uncontrollable limits in the journey of civilization and advancement. This updated edition comprises a brand new chapter on Japan and also contains new illustrations and instances taken from the television series.

This book exceeds the materialistic boundaries like government, religion, technology, and agriculture, and delves deep into the undiscovered truths about the human advancement process.

In The Metamorphosis, a man is transformed into a large, monstrous insect-like creature. He tries to adjust to his newfound body and to the emotions of his family who despise the monstrosity that he has become. Kafka’s writing is unique, as he favours delivering an impact with each sentence. He often writes of illogical and perhaps bizarre occurrences around us, portraying them in a surreal view which showed how characters in stories and real life are so similar. His characters often have no clear course of action and are constantly thrown into realistic yet unexplainable situations. Blending both the metaphysical and the absurd, Kafka has become one of the greatest literary juggernauts of his time. This collection presents all of his short stories, and thus is exhaustive with respect to everything Kafka wrote, except for his novels.

In the beginning, there was nothing. Man looked to the heavens for answers, and he began to wonder if there was someone there, someone more powerful than he could fathom. There obviously had to be an Almighty God who had created everything from nothing, and this sparked off a religion that would change the world. This religion, which evolved in the Middle East, in the cradle of what would be called Canaan, was destined to rattle the world. Largely polytheistic in nature at the time, the world began to be smitten with the view that there was one all-powerful God. This religion began to branch out, following different yet similar doctrines after the new age, with the birth of a man who would be tied together with it forever: Jesus of Nazareth, the prophesied Messiah. In time, another man would branch it out once again, into a powerful religion which would spread like a brush fire throughout the world: Islam. Together, Judaism, Christianity and Islam have survived a history almost 4000 years old. Despite their inherent differences, and the opposing viewpoints of their spokesmen, these religions have arisen from one central religion, and preach of one God: with three names, Yahweh, God or Allah.

It also forced the country to do a re-examination of its social and racial history. It made Americans look at where they stood on racial issues at the time the novel was published, in the late 1970s.

The novel sets out to trace the author's family history, back to the first member of the family to set foot in America, Kunta Kinte. Haley had heard stories about this man from his grandmother, a man she referred to as the African. The family had an oral tradition, passing on the tales of this man and his descendants, through each generation.

So, Haley was able to trace the stories from his grandmother to her father and her grandparents and thus trace his roots far back. Back to Kunta Kinte, who, the family stories said, lived in a place called Kamby Bolongo.

Two hundred years after his ancestor embarked on his unwilling journey, Haley stood on the same dock where Kunta Kinte is believed to have been put ashore, in America. Captured while he was chopping woods near his village, he was sold to slave traders and put on board a ship bound for unknown lands and a dark future.

Kunta Kinte is said to have passed on his story to his daughter, along with some words of the African dialect that he spoke. These descended through each generation, adding the story of their own generation as they passed it on.

Kunta Kinte had a daughter called Kizzy, who had a son called Chicken George. Chicken George was the son of his owner, his mother’s owner, which was a common occurrence in those days. He was a reputed gamecock trainer who earned his independence long before slavery was abolished in America.

Roots later ran into controversy, with allegations of plagiarism brought against the author and many issues regarding historical inaccuracies. However, the significance of the work goes beyond the controversies. It created an awareness of the African heritage and gave a face to the history of millions of African Americans. Roots was later adapted for a television series.

The authors explain that editorial distortion is worsened due to the reliance of news media on governmental sources of news. They also tell the readers that a magazine or any form of media may be prevented from gaining information, if they publish any information that attracts negative reactions from the government.

This results in the news media organization losing their grip over their viewers or readers, which in turn decreases their advertisers. Keeping these dire consequences in mind, the editorial boards of news media businesses twist their reports to favor the government, with the sole objective of sustaining themselves in the market. Through the course of this book, the readers are provided with insights into five editorially distorting filers that are utilized in news reporting these days.

They also tell the readers that major media outlets make most of their revenue from advertising. Hence, they need to function according to the political biases of their advertisers. The readers are also enlightened on the subject of flak and the damage it can trigger to the media outlets’ reputation, legal defense expenses, and decrease in advertising revenue. The authors have also touched on the topic of anti-communism, which Chomsky believes, is now replaced by the “War on Terror”, as the primary mechanism for social control.

Manufacturing Consent has also been adapted into a documentary film by the same name, directed by Peter Wintonick and Mark Achbar.

The first 70 pages or so of ""Sputnik Sweetheart"" construct this romantic triangle: He loves Sumire, Sumire loves Miu and whatever goes on in Miu's head is anyone's guess. Then Miu takes Sumire with her on a trip to Europe, and while the two women vacation on a Greek island, Sumire vanishes without a trace. Miu asks the narrator to fly out to the island and help with the search. Once there, he finds a handful of tantalizing clues: an odd conversation Miu and Sumire had about a spooked cat, a diary that Sumire kept on a floppy disk in which she writes of ""entering the world of dreams and never coming out. Living in dreams for the rest of time,"" and, strangest of all, Sumire's transcript of a secret Miu told her, the story of how Miu's black hair turned entirely white during a single night in a little Swiss town.

Murakami knows that the most haunting tales never have all their loose ends tied up by the last page, but unlike ""The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,"" ""Sputnik Sweetheart"" doesn't leave too many of them unspooled and dangling. It's a tighter book, if less grand and captivating, and the point of this exercise in the uncanny feels more focused. ""Why do people have to be this lonely?"" the narrator asks:

 

I closed my eyes and listened carefully for the descendants of Sputnik, even now circling the earth, gravity their only tie to the planet. Lonely metal souls in the unimpeded darkness of space, they meet, pass each other, and part, never to meet again. No words passing between them. No promises to keep.
Back in Japan, there will be a significant moment with a kleptomaniac child and a few more surprising encounters, but the lovely, sad, eerie Murakami spell remains firmly in place, the sense of its perfectly still center inviolate. It's still impossible to nail down, but its ingredients include loneliness, longing and an undeniable and sometimes frightening thread of the miraculous woven into the very fabric of life.

A direct and fundamentally optimistic indictment of the short-sightedness and intellectual arrogance that has characterized much of urban planning in this century, The Death and Life of Great American Cities has, since its first publication in 1961, become the standard against which all endeavors in that field are measured. In prose of outstanding immediacy, Jane Jacobs writes about what makes streets safe or unsafe; about what constitutes a neighborhood, and what function it serves within the larger organism of the city; about why some neighborhoods remain impoverished while others regenerate themselves. She writes about the salutary role of funeral parlors and tenement windows, the dangers of too much development money and too little diversity. Compassionate, bracingly indignant, and always keenly detailed, Jane Jacobs's monumental work provides an essential framework for assessing the vitality of all cities.(amazon.co.uk)",The Death and Life of Great American Cities,Jane Jacobs, , ,Vintage Books,9780679741954,"1st Edition,1992",480,India,English

Through an examination of old and new cosmological models, Roger Penrose sets out to prove, that the Big Bang was not the beginning of everything, nor will it be the end to everything.

In this book, Penrose offers a carefully detailed analysis of the second law of thermodynamics, stating that the universe is headed towards a total state of randomness.  Penrose further adds, with the passage of large amounts of time, mass breaks down, distances have no value, and our universe will continue to expand.

Ayesha is a twenty-something reporter in one of the world's most dangerous cities. Her assignments range from showing up at bomb sites and picking her way through scattered body parts to interviewing her boss's niece, the couture-cupcake designer. In between dicing with death and absurdity, Ayesha despairs over ever meeting a nice guy, someone like her old friend Saad, whose shoulder she cries on after every romantic misadventure. Her choices seem limited to narcissistic, adrenaline-chasing reporters who'll do anything to get their next story - to the spoilt offspring of the Karachi elite who'll do anything to cure their boredom.

The stunning debut novel from bestselling author Bill Clegg is a magnificently powerful story about a circle of people who find solace in the least likely of places as they cope with a horrific tragedy.

On the eve of her daughter's wedding, June Reid's life is completely devastated when a shocking disaster takes the lives of her daughter, her daughter's fiancé, her ex-husband, and her boyfriend, Luke - her entire family, all gone in a moment. And June is the only survivor. 

Alone and directionless, June drives across the country, away from her small Connecticut town. In her wake, a community emerges, weaving a beautiful and surprising web of connections through shared heartbreak. 

From the couple running a motel on the Pacific Ocean where June eventually settles into a quiet half-life, to the wedding's caterer whose bill has been forgotten, to Luke's mother, the shattered outcast of the town - everyone touched by the tragedy is changed as truths about their near and far histories finally come to light. 

Elegant and heartrending, and one of the most accomplished fiction debuts of the year, Did You Ever Have a Family is an absorbing, unforgettable tale that reveals humanity at its best through forgiveness and hope.

RAMACHANDRA GUHA
A very powerful story' VIDHU VINOD CHOPRA
Rahul Pandita was fourteen years old when he was forced to leave his
home in Srinagar along with his family, who were Kashmiri Panditsthe Hindu minority within a Muslim-majority Kashmir that was by 1990
becoming increasingly agitated with the cries of 'Azaadi' from India.
The heartbreaking story of Kashmir has so far been told mainly through the prism of the brutality of the Indian security forces,
the pro-independence demands of Muslim separatists, or India and Pakistan's political rivalry. But there is another part of Kashmir's
history that has remained unrecorded and buried.
Our Moon Has Blood Clots is the untold chapter in the story of Kashmir, in which hundreds of thousands of Kashmiri Pandits were tortured, killed and forced to leave their homes by Islamist militants, and to spend the rest of their lives in exile in their own country. Rahul Pandita has written a deeply
personal, powerful and unforgettable story of history, home and loss.

The book surveys the history of humankind from the evolution of archaic human species in the Stone Age up to the twenty-first century, focusing on Homo sapiens. The account is situated within a framework provided by the natural sciences, particularly evolutionary biology.
Harari's work situates its account of human history within a framework provided by the natural sciences, particularly evolutionary biology: he sees biology as setting the limits of possibility for human activity, and sees culture as shaping what happens within those bounds. The academic discipline of history is the account of cultural change.

Harari surveys the history of humankind from the evolution of archaic human species in the Stone Age up to the twenty-first century, focusing on Homo sapiens. He divides the history of Sapiens into four major parts:

The Cognitive Revolution (c. 70,000 BC, when Sapiens evolved imagination).
The Agricultural Revolution (c. 10,000 BC, the development of agriculture).
The unification of humankind (the gradual consolidation of human political organisations towards one global empire).
The Scientific Revolution (c. 1500 AD, the emergence of objective science).
Harari's main argument is that Sapiens came to dominate the world because it is the only animal that can cooperate flexibly in large numbers. He argues that prehistoric Sapiens were a key cause of the extinction of other human species such as the Neanderthals, along with numerous other megafauna. He further argues that the ability of Sapiens to cooperate in large numbers arises from its unique capacity to believe in things existing purely in the imagination, such as gods, nations, money, and human rights. Harari claims that all large-scale human cooperation systems – including religions, political structures, trade networks, and legal institutions – owe their emergence to Sapiens' distinctive cognitive capacity for fiction.[5] Accordingly, Harari regards money as a system of mutual trust and sees political and economic systems as more or less identical with religions.",Sapiens A Brief History Of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari, , ,Vintage Books,9780099590088,"1st Published,2014",498,India,English

His father is a rich sculptor working in Tokyo who tells Kafka about the Oedipal prediction. To escape this bad omen, Kafka runs away from home in search of his mother and sister.

The other main lead is an old and pleasant man Nakata, who is unable to read or write due to a weird accident in his childhood. But, he attains a special power to converse with all types of cats. He is particularly fond of a Siamese cat with efficient articulation.

On the other side, Kafka reaches a village and starts working in a library where Miss Saeki and Oshima work together. Miss Saeki is a reserved lady, while Oshima is a gay figure. Oshima guides Kafka.

After a series of thrilling events, Kafka comes to know about a remorseless murder. On the other hand, Nakata ends up hitching a ride with a truck driver, while searching for a missing cat.

Kafka and Nakata never confront each other, but their fates are destined to converge inexplicably.

An adventure, Kafka On The Shore has been written by the Japanese writer Haruki Murakami and was published in the year 2005. An esoteric story containing themes of magic, paranormal occurrences, suspense, and danger, it keeps its readers fully engrossed.
The book was very popular among fantasy lovers. The Japanese novel was later translated into English, bagging one award to its credit.

Kafka Tamura runs away from home at fifteen, under the shadow of
His father`s dark prophecy. 
The aging Nakata, tracker of the lost cast, who never recovered from
a bizarre childhood affliction finds his pleasantly simplified life
Suddenly turned upside down. 
As their parallel odysseys unravel, cats converse with people, fish
Tumble from the sky; a ghost-like pimp. Deploys a Hegel-spouting
Girl of the night; a forest harbors soldiers apparently un-aged since
World War II. There is a savage killing, but the identity of both
Victim and killer is a riddle – one of many which combine to create
An elegant and dreamlike masterpiece.

War and Peace begins in the Russian city of St. Petersburg in 1805, as fear of Napoleon’s ongoing war making begins to set in. Most of the characters are introduced at a party, including Pierre Bezukhov, Andrey Bolkonsky, and the Kuragin and Rostov families. Much of the novel focuses on the interactions between the Bezukhovs, Bolkonskys, and the Rostovs. After their introduction, Andrey Bolkonsky and Nikolay Rostov go to the Austrian front under General Kutuzov, a fictional representation of Mikhail Kutuzov, to engage with Napoleon’s troops. Andrey is then injured at the Battle of Austerlitz and presumed dead, until he arrives home to his wife, Lise, who dies during childbirth soon after. Pierre, meanwhile, has married Helene Kuragina. She is unfaithful to him, and Pierre duels with the other man, almost killing him. He soon becomes overwhelmed by his marriage and leaves Helene. He joins the Freemasons, which influences his personal and business fortunes greatly. In the meantime Nikolay has racked up a large amount of gambling debt, which causes the Rostov family to lose most of their fortune. He is encouraged to marry a wealthy heiress, despite promising to marry Sonya, his cousin. Nikolay eventually witnesses the peace between Tsar Alexander I and Napoleon (Treaties of Tilsit, signed in 1807). Andrey soon becomes involved with Natasha Rostov only to be told by his father that he must wait a year before marrying her. After some time away, Andrey discovers that Natasha has been unfaithful. He rejects her, and Pierre consoles her, eventually falling in love with her.

In 1812 Napoleon invades Russia, forcing Alexander to declare war. Andrey returns to service, and Pierre is driven to believe he must personally assassinate Napoleon. As the French advance, Mary, Lise’s sister, is forced to leave her house. Nikolay finds her in the streets, and the two reconnect. Pierre, still crazed by his imaginary duty, is apprehended by French forces and witnesses a number of executions, which deeply affect him. During his imprisonment, he befriends Platon Karatev, a wise peasant. He is later freed from the French and promptly falls ill.

Midnight's Children is a loose allegory for events in India both before and, primarily, after the independence and partition of India. The protagonist and narrator of the story is Saleem Sinai, born at the exact moment when India became an independent country. He was born with telepathic powers, as well as an enormous and constantly dripping nose with an extremely sensitive sense of smell. The novel is divided into three books.

The book begins with the story of the Sinai family, particularly with events leading up to India's Independence and Partition. Saleem is born precisely at midnight, 15 August 1947, therefore, exactly as old as independent India. He later discovers that all children born in India between 12 a.m. and 1 a.m. on that date are imbued with special powers. Saleem, using his telepathic powers, assembles a Midnight Children's Conference, reflective of the issues India faced in its early statehood concerning the cultural, linguistic, religious, and political differences faced by a vastly diverse nation. Saleem acts as a telepathic conduit, bringing hundreds of geographically disparate children into contact while also attempting to discover the meaning of their gifts. In particular, those children born closest to the stroke of midnight wield more powerful gifts than the others. Shiva ""of the Knees"", Saleem's nemesis, and Parvati, called ""Parvati-the-witch,"" are two of these children with notable gifts and roles in Saleem's story.

Meanwhile, Saleem's family begin a number of migrations and endure the numerous wars which plague the subcontinent. During this period he also suffers amnesia until he enters a quasi-mythological exile in the jungle of Sundarban, where he is re-endowed with his memory. In doing so, he reconnects with his childhood friends. Saleem later becomes involved with the Indira Gandhi-proclaimed Emergency and her son Sanjay's ""cleansing"" of the Jama Masjid slum. For a time Saleem is held as a political prisoner; these passages contain scathing criticisms of Indira Gandhi's over-reach during the Emergency as well as a personal lust for power bordering on godhood. The Emergency signals the end of the potency of the Midnight Children, and there is little left for Saleem to do but pick up the few pieces of his life he may still find and write the chronicle that encompasses both his personal history and that of his still-young nation, a chronicle written for his son, who, like his father, is both chained and supernaturally endowed by history.",Midnights Children (Man Booker Prize),Salman Rushdie, , ,Vintage Books,9780099578512,"1st Published,2006",650,Abroad,English

Preface
Archer Blood, the United States’ consul general in Dacca, was a gentlemanly diplomat raised in Virginia, a World War II navy veteran in the upswing of a promising Foreign Service career after several tours overseas. He was earnest and precise, known to some of his more unruly subordinates at the U.S. consulate as a good, conventional man. 
He had come to like his posting to this impoverished, green, and swampy land. But outside of the consulate's grimy offices, in the steamy heat, the city was dying. Night after night, Blood heard the gunshots. On the night of March 25, 1971, the Pakistan army had begun a relentless crackdown on Bengalis, all across what was then East Pakistan and is today an independent Bangladesh. Untold thousands of people were shot, bombed, or burned to death in Dacca alone. Blood had spent that grim night on the roof of his official residence, watching as tracer bullets lit up the sky, listening to clattering machine guns and thumping tank guns. There were fires across the ramshackle city. He knew the people in the deathly darkness below. He liked them. Many of the civilians facing the bullets were professional colleagues; some were his friends. 
It was, Blood and his staffers thought, their job to relay as much of this as they possibly could back to Washington. Witnessing one of the worst atrocities of the Cold War, Blood's consulate documented in horrific detail the slaughter of Bengali civilians: an area the size of two dozen city blocks that had been razed by gunfire; two newspaper office buildings in ruins; thatch-roofed villages in flames; specific targeting of the Bengalis' Hindu minority. 
The U.S. consulate gave detailed accounts of the killings at Dacca University, ordinarily a leafy, handsome enclave. At the wrecked campus, professors had been hauled from their homes to be gunned down.


The provost of the Hindu dormitory, a respected scholar of English, was dragged out of his residence and shot in the neck. Blood listed six other faculty members ""reliably reported killed by troops,"" with several more possibly dead. One American who had visited the campus said that students had been ""mowed down” in their rooms or as they fled, with a residence hall in flames and youths being machine-gunned.""
""At least two mass graves on campus,” Blood cabled. ""Stench terrible.” There were 148 corpses in one of these mass graves, according to the workmen forced to dig them. An official in the Dacca consulate estimated that at least five hundred students had been killed in the first two days of the crackdown, almost none of them fighting back. Blood reckoned that the rumored toll of a thousand dead at the university was ""exaggerated, although nothing these days is inconceivable.” After the massacre, he reported that an American eyewitness had seen an empty army truck arriving to get rid of a ""tightly packed pile of approximately twenty five corpses,” the last of many such batches of human remains.
THIS WAS, BLOOD KNEW, THE LAST THING HIS SUPERIORS IN Washington wanted to hear. Pakistan was an ally-a military dictatorship, but fiercely anticommunist. Blood detailed how Pakistan was using U.S. weapons-tanks, jet fighters, gigantic troop transport airplanes, jeeps, guns, ammunition-to crush the Bengalis. In one of the awkward alignments of the Cold War, President Richard Nixon had lined up the democratic United States with this authoritarian government, while the despots in the Soviet Union found themselves standing behind democratic India. 
Nixon and Henry Kissinger, the brilliant White House national security advisor, were driven not just by such Cold War calculations, but a starkly personal and emotional dislike of India and Indians. Nixon enjoyed his friendship with Pakistan's military dictator, General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan, known as Yahya, who was helping to set up the top secret opening to China. The White House did not want to be seen as doing anything that might hint at the breakup of Pakistan-no matter what was happening to civilians in the east wing of Pakistan. 
The onslaught would continue for months. The Dacca consulate stubbornly kept up its reporting. But, Blood later recalled, his cables were met with ""a deafening silence.” He was not allowed to protest to the Pakistani authorities. He ratcheted up his dispatches, sending in a blistering cable tagged ""Selective Genocide,” urging his bosses to speak out against the atrocities being committed by the Pakistani military. The White House staff passed this up to Kissinger, who paid no heed. Then on April 6, two weeks into the slaughter, Blood and almost his entire consulate sent in a telegram formally declaring their ""strong dissent""-a total repudiation of the policy that they were there to carry out. That cable-perhaps the most radical rejection of U.S. policy ever sent by its diplomats-blasted the United States for silence in the face of atrocities, for not denouncing the quashing of democracy, for showing “moral bankruptcy” in the face of what they bluntly called genocide.
THIS BOOK ISABOUT HOW TWO OF THE WORLD'S GREAT DEMOCRACIESthe United States and India-faced up to one of the most terrible humanitarian crises of the twentieth century. The slaughter in what is now Bangladesh stands as one of the cardinal moral challenges of recent history, although today it is far more familiar to South Asians than to Americans. It had a monumental impact on India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh-almost a sixth of humanity in 1971. In the dark annals of modern cruelty, it ranks as bloodier than Bosnia and by some accounts in the same rough league as Rwanda. It was a defining moment for both the United States and India, where their humane principles were put to the test.
"" For the United States, as Archer Blood understood, a small number of atrocities are so awful that they stand outside of the normal day-today flow of diplomacy: the Armenian genocide, the Holocaust, Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda. When we think of U.S. leaders failing the test of decency in such moments, we usually think of uncaring disengagement: Franklin Roosevelt fighting World War II without taking serious steps to try to rescue Jews from the Nazi dragnet, or Bill Clinton standing idly by during the Rwandan genocide. 
But Pakistan's slaughter of its Bengalis in 1971 is starkly different. Here the United States was allied with the killers. The White House was actively and knowingly supporting a murderous regime at many of the most crucial moments. There was no question about whether the United States should intervene; it was already intervening on behalf of a military dictatorship decimating its own people. 
This stands as one of the worst moments of moral blindness in U.S. foreign policy. Pakistan's crackdown on the Bengalis was not routine or small-scale killing, not something that could be dismissed as business as usual, but a colossal and systematic onslaught. Midway through the bloodshed, both the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department conservatively estimated that about two hundred thousand people had lost their lives. Many more would perish, cut down by Pakistani forces or dying in droves in miserable refugee camps. ""The story of East Bengal will surely be written as one of the greatest nightmares of modern times,” declared Edward Kennedy, who led the outcry in the Senate. But in the depths of the Cold War, Nixon and Kissinger were unyielding in their support for Pakistan, making possible horrific crimes against humanity-plausibly even a genocide-in that country's eastern wing.
"" The ongoing Bengali slaughter led within a few months to a major war between Pakistan and India. In that time, the White House had every opportunity to grasp how bad these atrocities were. There were sober misgivings voiced in the White House, and thunderous protests from the State Department and its emissaries in Delhi and Dacca, with Archer Blood the loudest voice of all. But throughout it all, from the outbreak of civil war to the Bengali massacres to Pakistan's crushing defeat by the Indian military, Nixon and Kissinger, unfazed by detailed knowledge of the massacres, stood stoutly behind Pakistan. 
As its most important international backer, the United States had great influence over Pakistan. But at almost every turning point in the crisis, Nixon and Kissinger failed to use that leverage to avert disaster. Before the shooting started, they consciously decided not to warn Pakistan's military chiefs against using violence on their own population. They did not urge caution or impose conditions that might have discouraged the Pakistani military government from butchering its own citizenry. They did not threaten the loss of U.S. support or even sanctions if Pakistan took the wrong course. They allowed the army to sweep aside the results of Pakistan's first truly free and fair democratic election, without even suggesting that the military strongmen try to work out a power-sharing deal with the Bengali leadership that had won the vote. They did not ask that Pakistan refrain from using U.S. weaponry to slaughter civilians, even though that could have impeded the military's rampage, and might have deterred the army. There was no public condemnation-nor even a private threat of it-from the president, the secretary of state, or other senior officials. The administration almost entirely contented itself with making gentle, token suggestions.....",The Blood Telegram: Indias Secret War in East Pakistan,Gary J.

It was roughly at that point of time that a breaking off happened, which slowly led to the evolution of societies and groups. Gradually, people started getting involved in farming and rearing numerous plants and animals in parts of Eurasia and parts of the Americas. There was a gradual rise of planters and animal domesticators. It can be learnt from the book that the people who got rid of other race groups and resorted to measures like conquest, removal, and replacements are the ones who had advanced in the paths of becoming civilized and improved groups. The road which started from searching for food in random places and ended in proper organized living was greatly affected by the weather and the topography too. But, there remains the curiosity as to how the segregation occurred and how various cultures and traditions came into being.

It is also unclear why the Australians, Americans, or Africans did not rule over Europe. The author, Diamond, reveals that the various explanations about racial activities whose reasons are often traced back to cultural divisions are actually the reason of biological separations. He comes up with valuable instances and proofs that there was a relation between germs and living beings’ civilization and also goes on to discuss the ways in which germs got scattered in uncontrollable limits in the journey of civilization and advancement. This updated edition comprises a brand new chapter on Japan and also contains new illustrations and instances taken from the television series.

This book exceeds the materialistic boundaries like government, religion, technology, and agriculture, and delves deep into the undiscovered truths about the human advancement process.

In The Metamorphosis, a man is transformed into a large, monstrous insect-like creature. He tries to adjust to his newfound body and to the emotions of his family who despise the monstrosity that he has become. Kafka’s writing is unique, as he favours delivering an impact with each sentence. He often writes of illogical and perhaps bizarre occurrences around us, portraying them in a surreal view which showed how characters in stories and real life are so similar. His characters often have no clear course of action and are constantly thrown into realistic yet unexplainable situations. Blending both the metaphysical and the absurd, Kafka has become one of the greatest literary juggernauts of his time. This collection presents all of his short stories, and thus is exhaustive with respect to everything Kafka wrote, except for his novels.

In the beginning, there was nothing. Man looked to the heavens for answers, and he began to wonder if there was someone there, someone more powerful than he could fathom. There obviously had to be an Almighty God who had created everything from nothing, and this sparked off a religion that would change the world. This religion, which evolved in the Middle East, in the cradle of what would be called Canaan, was destined to rattle the world. Largely polytheistic in nature at the time, the world began to be smitten with the view that there was one all-powerful God. This religion began to branch out, following different yet similar doctrines after the new age, with the birth of a man who would be tied together with it forever: Jesus of Nazareth, the prophesied Messiah. In time, another man would branch it out once again, into a powerful religion which would spread like a brush fire throughout the world: Islam. Together, Judaism, Christianity and Islam have survived a history almost 4000 years old. Despite their inherent differences, and the opposing viewpoints of their spokesmen, these religions have arisen from one central religion, and preach of one God: with three names, Yahweh, God or Allah.

It also forced the country to do a re-examination of its social and racial history. It made Americans look at where they stood on racial issues at the time the novel was published, in the late 1970s.

The novel sets out to trace the author's family history, back to the first member of the family to set foot in America, Kunta Kinte. Haley had heard stories about this man from his grandmother, a man she referred to as the African. The family had an oral tradition, passing on the tales of this man and his descendants, through each generation.

So, Haley was able to trace the stories from his grandmother to her father and her grandparents and thus trace his roots far back. Back to Kunta Kinte, who, the family stories said, lived in a place called Kamby Bolongo.

Two hundred years after his ancestor embarked on his unwilling journey, Haley stood on the same dock where Kunta Kinte is believed to have been put ashore, in America. Captured while he was chopping woods near his village, he was sold to slave traders and put on board a ship bound for unknown lands and a dark future.

Kunta Kinte is said to have passed on his story to his daughter, along with some words of the African dialect that he spoke. These descended through each generation, adding the story of their own generation as they passed it on.

Kunta Kinte had a daughter called Kizzy, who had a son called Chicken George. Chicken George was the son of his owner, his mother’s owner, which was a common occurrence in those days. He was a reputed gamecock trainer who earned his independence long before slavery was abolished in America.

Roots later ran into controversy, with allegations of plagiarism brought against the author and many issues regarding historical inaccuracies. However, the significance of the work goes beyond the controversies. It created an awareness of the African heritage and gave a face to the history of millions of African Americans. Roots was later adapted for a television series.

The authors explain that editorial distortion is worsened due to the reliance of news media on governmental sources of news. They also tell the readers that a magazine or any form of media may be prevented from gaining information, if they publish any information that attracts negative reactions from the government.

This results in the news media organization losing their grip over their viewers or readers, which in turn decreases their advertisers. Keeping these dire consequences in mind, the editorial boards of news media businesses twist their reports to favor the government, with the sole objective of sustaining themselves in the market. Through the course of this book, the readers are provided with insights into five editorially distorting filers that are utilized in news reporting these days.

They also tell the readers that major media outlets make most of their revenue from advertising. Hence, they need to function according to the political biases of their advertisers. The readers are also enlightened on the subject of flak and the damage it can trigger to the media outlets’ reputation, legal defense expenses, and decrease in advertising revenue. The authors have also touched on the topic of anti-communism, which Chomsky believes, is now replaced by the “War on Terror”, as the primary mechanism for social control.

Manufacturing Consent has also been adapted into a documentary film by the same name, directed by Peter Wintonick and Mark Achbar.

The first 70 pages or so of ""Sputnik Sweetheart"" construct this romantic triangle: He loves Sumire, Sumire loves Miu and whatever goes on in Miu's head is anyone's guess. Then Miu takes Sumire with her on a trip to Europe, and while the two women vacation on a Greek island, Sumire vanishes without a trace. Miu asks the narrator to fly out to the island and help with the search. Once there, he finds a handful of tantalizing clues: an odd conversation Miu and Sumire had about a spooked cat, a diary that Sumire kept on a floppy disk in which she writes of ""entering the world of dreams and never coming out. Living in dreams for the rest of time,"" and, strangest of all, Sumire's transcript of a secret Miu told her, the story of how Miu's black hair turned entirely white during a single night in a little Swiss town.

Murakami knows that the most haunting tales never have all their loose ends tied up by the last page, but unlike ""The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,"" ""Sputnik Sweetheart"" doesn't leave too many of them unspooled and dangling. It's a tighter book, if less grand and captivating, and the point of this exercise in the uncanny feels more focused. ""Why do people have to be this lonely?"" the narrator asks:

 

I closed my eyes and listened carefully for the descendants of Sputnik, even now circling the earth, gravity their only tie to the planet. Lonely metal souls in the unimpeded darkness of space, they meet, pass each other, and part, never to meet again. No words passing between them. No promises to keep.
Back in Japan, there will be a significant moment with a kleptomaniac child and a few more surprising encounters, but the lovely, sad, eerie Murakami spell remains firmly in place, the sense of its perfectly still center inviolate. It's still impossible to nail down, but its ingredients include loneliness, longing and an undeniable and sometimes frightening thread of the miraculous woven into the very fabric of life.

A direct and fundamentally optimistic indictment of the short-sightedness and intellectual arrogance that has characterized much of urban planning in this century, The Death and Life of Great American Cities has, since its first publication in 1961, become the standard against which all endeavors in that field are measured. In prose of outstanding immediacy, Jane Jacobs writes about what makes streets safe or unsafe; about what constitutes a neighborhood, and what function it serves within the larger organism of the city; about why some neighborhoods remain impoverished while others regenerate themselves. She writes about the salutary role of funeral parlors and tenement windows, the dangers of too much development money and too little diversity. Compassionate, bracingly indignant, and always keenly detailed, Jane Jacobs's monumental work provides an essential framework for assessing the vitality of all cities.(amazon.co.uk)",The Death and Life of Great American Cities,Jane Jacobs, , ,Vintage Books,9780679741954,"1st Edition,1992",480,India,English

Penrose further adds, with the passage of large amounts of time, mass breaks down, distances have no value, and our universe will continue to expand.

Penrose was primarily concerned with what occurred in the universe before the “Big Bang”?

The stunning debut novel from bestselling author Bill Clegg is a magnificently powerful story about a circle of people who find solace in the least likely of places as they cope with a horrific tragedy.

On the eve of her daughter's wedding, June Reid's life is completely devastated when a shocking disaster takes the lives of her daughter, her daughter's fiancé, her ex-husband, and her boyfriend, Luke - her entire family, all gone in a moment. And June is the only survivor. 

Alone and directionless, June drives across the country, away from her small Connecticut town. In her wake, a community emerges, weaving a beautiful and surprising web of connections through shared heartbreak. 

From the couple running a motel on the Pacific Ocean where June eventually settles into a quiet half-life, to the wedding's caterer whose bill has been forgotten, to Luke's mother, the shattered outcast of the town - everyone touched by the tragedy is changed as truths about their near and far histories finally come to light. 

Elegant and heartrending, and one of the most accomplished fiction debuts of the year, Did You Ever Have a Family is an absorbing, unforgettable tale that reveals humanity at its best through forgiveness and hope. At its core is a celebration of family - the ones we are born with and the ones we create.

RAMACHANDRA GUHA
A very powerful story' VIDHU VINOD CHOPRA
Rahul Pandita was fourteen years old when he was forced to leave his
home in Srinagar along with his family, who were Kashmiri Panditsthe Hindu minority within a Muslim-majority Kashmir that was by 1990
becoming increasingly agitated with the cries of 'Azaadi' from India.
The heartbreaking story of Kashmir has so far been told mainly through the prism of the brutality of the Indian security forces,
the pro-independence demands of Muslim separatists, or India and Pakistan's political rivalry. But there is another part of Kashmir's
history that has remained unrecorded and buried.
Our Moon Has Blood Clots is the untold chapter in the story of Kashmir, in which hundreds of thousands of Kashmiri Pandits were tortured, killed and forced to leave their homes by Islamist militants, and to spend the rest of their lives in exile in their own country. Rahul Pandita has written a deeply
personal, powerful and unforgettable story of history, home and loss.

The book surveys the history of humankind from the evolution of archaic human species in the Stone Age up to the twenty-first century, focusing on Homo sapiens. The account is situated within a framework provided by the natural sciences, particularly evolutionary biology.
Harari's work situates its account of human history within a framework provided by the natural sciences, particularly evolutionary biology: he sees biology as setting the limits of possibility for human activity, and sees culture as shaping what happens within those bounds. The academic discipline of history is the account of cultural change.

Harari surveys the history of humankind from the evolution of archaic human species in the Stone Age up to the twenty-first century, focusing on Homo sapiens. He divides the history of Sapiens into four major parts:

The Cognitive Revolution (c. 70,000 BC, when Sapiens evolved imagination).
The Agricultural Revolution (c. 10,000 BC, the development of agriculture).
The unification of humankind (the gradual consolidation of human political organisations towards one global empire).
The Scientific Revolution (c. 1500 AD, the emergence of objective science).
Harari's main argument is that Sapiens came to dominate the world because it is the only animal that can cooperate flexibly in large numbers. He argues that prehistoric Sapiens were a key cause of the extinction of other human species such as the Neanderthals, along with numerous other megafauna. He further argues that the ability of Sapiens to cooperate in large numbers arises from its unique capacity to believe in things existing purely in the imagination, such as gods, nations, money, and human rights. Harari claims that all large-scale human cooperation systems – including religions, political structures, trade networks, and legal institutions – owe their emergence to Sapiens' distinctive cognitive capacity for fiction.[5] Accordingly, Harari regards money as a system of mutual trust and sees political and economic systems as more or less identical with religions.",Sapiens A Brief History Of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari, , ,Vintage Books,9780099590088,"1st Published,2014",498,India,English

His father is a rich sculptor working in Tokyo who tells Kafka about the Oedipal prediction. To escape this bad omen, Kafka runs away from home in search of his mother and sister.

The other main lead is an old and pleasant man Nakata, who is unable to read or write due to a weird accident in his childhood. But, he attains a special power to converse with all types of cats. He is particularly fond of a Siamese cat with efficient articulation.

On the other side, Kafka reaches a village and starts working in a library where Miss Saeki and Oshima work together. Miss Saeki is a reserved lady, while Oshima is a gay figure. Oshima guides Kafka.

After a series of thrilling events, Kafka comes to know about a remorseless murder. On the other hand, Nakata ends up hitching a ride with a truck driver, while searching for a missing cat.

Kafka and Nakata never confront each other, but their fates are destined to converge inexplicably.

An adventure, Kafka On The Shore has been written by the Japanese writer Haruki Murakami and was published in the year 2005. An esoteric story containing themes of magic, paranormal occurrences, suspense, and danger, it keeps its readers fully engrossed.
The book was very popular among fantasy lovers. The Japanese novel was later translated into English, bagging one award to its credit.

War and Peace begins in the Russian city of St. Petersburg in 1805, as fear of Napoleon’s ongoing war making begins to set in. Most of the characters are introduced at a party, including Pierre Bezukhov, Andrey Bolkonsky, and the Kuragin and Rostov families. Much of the novel focuses on the interactions between the Bezukhovs, Bolkonskys, and the Rostovs. After their introduction, Andrey Bolkonsky and Nikolay Rostov go to the Austrian front under General Kutuzov, a fictional representation of Mikhail Kutuzov, to engage with Napoleon’s troops. Andrey is then injured at the Battle of Austerlitz and presumed dead, until he arrives home to his wife, Lise, who dies during childbirth soon after. Pierre, meanwhile, has married Helene Kuragina. She is unfaithful to him, and Pierre duels with the other man, almost killing him. He soon becomes overwhelmed by his marriage and leaves Helene. He joins the Freemasons, which influences his personal and business fortunes greatly. In the meantime Nikolay has racked up a large amount of gambling debt, which causes the Rostov family to lose most of their fortune. He is encouraged to marry a wealthy heiress, despite promising to marry Sonya, his cousin. Nikolay eventually witnesses the peace between Tsar Alexander I and Napoleon (Treaties of Tilsit, signed in 1807). Andrey soon becomes involved with Natasha Rostov only to be told by his father that he must wait a year before marrying her. After some time away, Andrey discovers that Natasha has been unfaithful. He rejects her, and Pierre consoles her, eventually falling in love with her.

In 1812 Napoleon invades Russia, forcing Alexander to declare war. Andrey returns to service, and Pierre is driven to believe he must personally assassinate Napoleon. As the French advance, Mary, Lise’s sister, is forced to leave her house. Nikolay finds her in the streets, and the two reconnect. Pierre, still crazed by his imaginary duty, is apprehended by French forces and witnesses a number of executions, which deeply affect him. During his imprisonment, he befriends Platon Karatev, a wise peasant. He is later freed from the French and promptly falls ill. After recovering, he marries Natasha, and they have four children together.

Midnight's Children is a loose allegory for events in India both before and, primarily, after the independence and partition of India. The protagonist and narrator of the story is Saleem Sinai, born at the exact moment when India became an independent country. He was born with telepathic powers, as well as an enormous and constantly dripping nose with an extremely sensitive sense of smell. The novel is divided into three books.

The book begins with the story of the Sinai family, particularly with events leading up to India's Independence and Partition. Saleem is born precisely at midnight, 15 August 1947, therefore, exactly as old as independent India. He later discovers that all children born in India between 12 a.m. and 1 a.m. on that date are imbued with special powers. Saleem, using his telepathic powers, assembles a Midnight Children's Conference, reflective of the issues India faced in its early statehood concerning the cultural, linguistic, religious, and political differences faced by a vastly diverse nation. Saleem acts as a telepathic conduit, bringing hundreds of geographically disparate children into contact while also attempting to discover the meaning of their gifts. In particular, those children born closest to the stroke of midnight wield more powerful gifts than the others. Shiva ""of the Knees"", Saleem's nemesis, and Parvati, called ""Parvati-the-witch,"" are two of these children with notable gifts and roles in Saleem's story.

Meanwhile, Saleem's family begin a number of migrations and endure the numerous wars which plague the subcontinent. During this period he also suffers amnesia until he enters a quasi-mythological exile in the jungle of Sundarban, where he is re-endowed with his memory. In doing so, he reconnects with his childhood friends. Saleem later becomes involved with the Indira Gandhi-proclaimed Emergency and her son Sanjay's ""cleansing"" of the Jama Masjid slum. For a time Saleem is held as a political prisoner; these passages contain scathing criticisms of Indira Gandhi's over-reach during the Emergency as well as a personal lust for power bordering on godhood. The Emergency signals the end of the potency of the Midnight Children, and there is little left for Saleem to do but pick up the few pieces of his life he may still find and write the chronicle that encompasses both his personal history and that of his still-young nation, a chronicle written for his son, who, like his father, is both chained and supernaturally endowed by history.",Midnights Children (Man Booker Prize),Salman Rushdie, , ,Vintage Books,9780099578512,"1st Published,2006",650,Abroad,English

In his new novel, Paulo Coelho, bestselling author of The Alchemist and Adultery, brings to life one of history’s most enigmatic women: Mata Hari. 

HER ONLY CRIME WAS TO BE AN INDEPENDENT WOMAN
 
When Mata Hari arrived in Paris she was penniless.  Within months she was the most celebrated woman in the city.

Preface
Archer Blood, the United States’ consul general in Dacca, was a gentlemanly diplomat raised in Virginia, a World War II navy veteran in the upswing of a promising Foreign Service career after several tours overseas. He was earnest and precise, known to some of his more unruly subordinates at the U.S. consulate as a good, conventional man. 
He had come to like his posting to this impoverished, green, and swampy land. But outside of the consulate's grimy offices, in the steamy heat, the city was dying. Night after night, Blood heard the gunshots. On the night of March 25, 1971, the Pakistan army had begun a relentless crackdown on Bengalis, all across what was then East Pakistan and is today an independent Bangladesh. Untold thousands of people were shot, bombed, or burned to death in Dacca alone. Blood had spent that grim night on the roof of his official residence, watching as tracer bullets lit up the sky, listening to clattering machine guns and thumping tank guns. There were fires across the ramshackle city. He knew the people in the deathly darkness below. He liked them. Many of the civilians facing the bullets were professional colleagues; some were his friends. 
It was, Blood and his staffers thought, their job to relay as much of this as they possibly could back to Washington. Witnessing one of the worst atrocities of the Cold War, Blood's consulate documented in horrific detail the slaughter of Bengali civilians: an area the size of two dozen city blocks that had been razed by gunfire; two newspaper office buildings in ruins; thatch-roofed villages in flames; specific targeting of the Bengalis' Hindu minority. 
The U.S. consulate gave detailed accounts of the killings at Dacca University, ordinarily a leafy, handsome enclave. At the wrecked campus, professors had been hauled from their homes to be gunned down.


The provost of the Hindu dormitory, a respected scholar of English, was dragged out of his residence and shot in the neck. Blood listed six other faculty members ""reliably reported killed by troops,"" with several more possibly dead. One American who had visited the campus said that students had been ""mowed down” in their rooms or as they fled, with a residence hall in flames and youths being machine-gunned.""
""At least two mass graves on campus,” Blood cabled. ""Stench terrible.” There were 148 corpses in one of these mass graves, according to the workmen forced to dig them. An official in the Dacca consulate estimated that at least five hundred students had been killed in the first two days of the crackdown, almost none of them fighting back. Blood reckoned that the rumored toll of a thousand dead at the university was ""exaggerated, although nothing these days is inconceivable.” After the massacre, he reported that an American eyewitness had seen an empty army truck arriving to get rid of a ""tightly packed pile of approximately twenty five corpses,” the last of many such batches of human remains.
THIS WAS, BLOOD KNEW, THE LAST THING HIS SUPERIORS IN Washington wanted to hear. Pakistan was an ally-a military dictatorship, but fiercely anticommunist. Blood detailed how Pakistan was using U.S. weapons-tanks, jet fighters, gigantic troop transport airplanes, jeeps, guns, ammunition-to crush the Bengalis. In one of the awkward alignments of the Cold War, President Richard Nixon had lined up the democratic United States with this authoritarian government, while the despots in the Soviet Union found themselves standing behind democratic India. 
Nixon and Henry Kissinger, the brilliant White House national security advisor, were driven not just by such Cold War calculations, but a starkly personal and emotional dislike of India and Indians. Nixon enjoyed his friendship with Pakistan's military dictator, General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan, known as Yahya, who was helping to set up the top secret opening to China. The White House did not want to be seen as doing anything that might hint at the breakup of Pakistan-no matter what was happening to civilians in the east wing of Pakistan. 
The onslaught would continue for months. The Dacca consulate stubbornly kept up its reporting. But, Blood later recalled, his cables were met with ""a deafening silence.” He was not allowed to protest to the Pakistani authorities. He ratcheted up his dispatches, sending in a blistering cable tagged ""Selective Genocide,” urging his bosses to speak out against the atrocities being committed by the Pakistani military. The White House staff passed this up to Kissinger, who paid no heed. Then on April 6, two weeks into the slaughter, Blood and almost his entire consulate sent in a telegram formally declaring their ""strong dissent""-a total repudiation of the policy that they were there to carry out. That cable-perhaps the most radical rejection of U.S. policy ever sent by its diplomats-blasted the United States for silence in the face of atrocities, for not denouncing the quashing of democracy, for showing “moral bankruptcy” in the face of what they bluntly called genocide.
THIS BOOK ISABOUT HOW TWO OF THE WORLD'S GREAT DEMOCRACIESthe United States and India-faced up to one of the most terrible humanitarian crises of the twentieth century. The slaughter in what is now Bangladesh stands as one of the cardinal moral challenges of recent history, although today it is far more familiar to South Asians than to Americans. It had a monumental impact on India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh-almost a sixth of humanity in 1971. In the dark annals of modern cruelty, it ranks as bloodier than Bosnia and by some accounts in the same rough league as Rwanda. It was a defining moment for both the United States and India, where their humane principles were put to the test.
"" For the United States, as Archer Blood understood, a small number of atrocities are so awful that they stand outside of the normal day-today flow of diplomacy: the Armenian genocide, the Holocaust, Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda. When we think of U.S. leaders failing the test of decency in such moments, we usually think of uncaring disengagement: Franklin Roosevelt fighting World War II without taking serious steps to try to rescue Jews from the Nazi dragnet, or Bill Clinton standing idly by during the Rwandan genocide. 
But Pakistan's slaughter of its Bengalis in 1971 is starkly different. Here the United States was allied with the killers. The White House was actively and knowingly supporting a murderous regime at many of the most crucial moments. There was no question about whether the United States should intervene; it was already intervening on behalf of a military dictatorship decimating its own people. 
This stands as one of the worst moments of moral blindness in U.S. foreign policy. Pakistan's crackdown on the Bengalis was not routine or small-scale killing, not something that could be dismissed as business as usual, but a colossal and systematic onslaught. Midway through the bloodshed, both the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department conservatively estimated that about two hundred thousand people had lost their lives. Many more would perish, cut down by Pakistani forces or dying in droves in miserable refugee camps. ""The story of East Bengal will surely be written as one of the greatest nightmares of modern times,” declared Edward Kennedy, who led the outcry in the Senate. But in the depths of the Cold War, Nixon and Kissinger were unyielding in their support for Pakistan, making possible horrific crimes against humanity-plausibly even a genocide-in that country's eastern wing.
"" The ongoing Bengali slaughter led within a few months to a major war between Pakistan and India. In that time, the White House had every opportunity to grasp how bad these atrocities were. There were sober misgivings voiced in the White House, and thunderous protests from the State Department and its emissaries in Delhi and Dacca, with Archer Blood the loudest voice of all. But throughout it all, from the outbreak of civil war to the Bengali massacres to Pakistan's crushing defeat by the Indian military, Nixon and Kissinger, unfazed by detailed knowledge of the massacres, stood stoutly behind Pakistan. 
As its most important international backer, the United States had great influence over Pakistan. But at almost every turning point in the crisis, Nixon and Kissinger failed to use that leverage to avert disaster. Before the shooting started, they consciously decided not to warn Pakistan's military chiefs against using violence on their own population. They did not urge caution or impose conditions that might have discouraged the Pakistani military government from butchering its own citizenry. They did not threaten the loss of U.S. support or even sanctions if Pakistan took the wrong course. They allowed the army to sweep aside the results of Pakistan's first truly free and fair democratic election, without even suggesting that the military strongmen try to work out a power-sharing deal with the Bengali leadership that had won the vote. They did not ask that Pakistan refrain from using U.S. weaponry to slaughter civilians, even though that could have impeded the military's rampage, and might have deterred the army. There was no public condemnation-nor even a private threat of it-from the president, the secretary of state, or other senior officials. The administration almost entirely contented itself with making gentle, token suggestions.....",The Blood Telegram: Indias Secret War in East Pakistan,Gary J.

It was roughly at that point of time that a breaking off happened, which slowly led to the evolution of societies and groups. Gradually, people started getting involved in farming and rearing numerous plants and animals in parts of Eurasia and parts of the Americas. There was a gradual rise of planters and animal domesticators. It can be learnt from the book that the people who got rid of other race groups and resorted to measures like conquest, removal, and replacements are the ones who had advanced in the paths of becoming civilized and improved groups. The road which started from searching for food in random places and ended in proper organized living was greatly affected by the weather and the topography too. But, there remains the curiosity as to how the segregation occurred and how various cultures and traditions came into being.

It is also unclear why the Australians, Americans, or Africans did not rule over Europe. The author, Diamond, reveals that the various explanations about racial activities whose reasons are often traced back to cultural divisions are actually the reason of biological separations. He comes up with valuable instances and proofs that there was a relation between germs and living beings’ civilization and also goes on to discuss the ways in which germs got scattered in uncontrollable limits in the journey of civilization and advancement. This updated edition comprises a brand new chapter on Japan and also contains new illustrations and instances taken from the television series.

This book exceeds the materialistic boundaries like government, religion, technology, and agriculture, and delves deep into the undiscovered truths about the human advancement process.

In The Metamorphosis, a man is transformed into a large, monstrous insect-like creature. He tries to adjust to his newfound body and to the emotions of his family who despise the monstrosity that he has become. Kafka’s writing is unique, as he favours delivering an impact with each sentence. He often writes of illogical and perhaps bizarre occurrences around us, portraying them in a surreal view which showed how characters in stories and real life are so similar. His characters often have no clear course of action and are constantly thrown into realistic yet unexplainable situations. Blending both the metaphysical and the absurd, Kafka has become one of the greatest literary juggernauts of his time. This collection presents all of his short stories, and thus is exhaustive with respect to everything Kafka wrote, except for his novels.

In the beginning, there was nothing. Man looked to the heavens for answers, and he began to wonder if there was someone there, someone more powerful than he could fathom. There obviously had to be an Almighty God who had created everything from nothing, and this sparked off a religion that would change the world. This religion, which evolved in the Middle East, in the cradle of what would be called Canaan, was destined to rattle the world. Largely polytheistic in nature at the time, the world began to be smitten with the view that there was one all-powerful God. This religion began to branch out, following different yet similar doctrines after the new age, with the birth of a man who would be tied together with it forever: Jesus of Nazareth, the prophesied Messiah. In time, another man would branch it out once again, into a powerful religion which would spread like a brush fire throughout the world: Islam. Together, Judaism, Christianity and Islam have survived a history almost 4000 years old. Despite their inherent differences, and the opposing viewpoints of their spokesmen, these religions have arisen from one central religion, and preach of one God: with three names, Yahweh, God or Allah.

It also forced the country to do a re-examination of its social and racial history. It made Americans look at where they stood on racial issues at the time the novel was published, in the late 1970s.

The novel sets out to trace the author's family history, back to the first member of the family to set foot in America, Kunta Kinte. Haley had heard stories about this man from his grandmother, a man she referred to as the African. The family had an oral tradition, passing on the tales of this man and his descendants, through each generation.

So, Haley was able to trace the stories from his grandmother to her father and her grandparents and thus trace his roots far back. Back to Kunta Kinte, who, the family stories said, lived in a place called Kamby Bolongo.

Two hundred years after his ancestor embarked on his unwilling journey, Haley stood on the same dock where Kunta Kinte is believed to have been put ashore, in America. Captured while he was chopping woods near his village, he was sold to slave traders and put on board a ship bound for unknown lands and a dark future.

Kunta Kinte is said to have passed on his story to his daughter, along with some words of the African dialect that he spoke. These descended through each generation, adding the story of their own generation as they passed it on.

Kunta Kinte had a daughter called Kizzy, who had a son called Chicken George. Chicken George was the son of his owner, his mother’s owner, which was a common occurrence in those days. He was a reputed gamecock trainer who earned his independence long before slavery was abolished in America.

Roots later ran into controversy, with allegations of plagiarism brought against the author and many issues regarding historical inaccuracies. However, the significance of the work goes beyond the controversies. It created an awareness of the African heritage and gave a face to the history of millions of African Americans. Roots was later adapted for a television series.

The authors explain that editorial distortion is worsened due to the reliance of news media on governmental sources of news. They also tell the readers that a magazine or any form of media may be prevented from gaining information, if they publish any information that attracts negative reactions from the government.

This results in the news media organization losing their grip over their viewers or readers, which in turn decreases their advertisers. Keeping these dire consequences in mind, the editorial boards of news media businesses twist their reports to favor the government, with the sole objective of sustaining themselves in the market. Through the course of this book, the readers are provided with insights into five editorially distorting filers that are utilized in news reporting these days.

They also tell the readers that major media outlets make most of their revenue from advertising. Hence, they need to function according to the political biases of their advertisers. The readers are also enlightened on the subject of flak and the damage it can trigger to the media outlets’ reputation, legal defense expenses, and decrease in advertising revenue. The authors have also touched on the topic of anti-communism, which Chomsky believes, is now replaced by the “War on Terror”, as the primary mechanism for social control.

Manufacturing Consent has also been adapted into a documentary film by the same name, directed by Peter Wintonick and Mark Achbar.

The first 70 pages or so of ""Sputnik Sweetheart"" construct this romantic triangle: He loves Sumire, Sumire loves Miu and whatever goes on in Miu's head is anyone's guess. Then Miu takes Sumire with her on a trip to Europe, and while the two women vacation on a Greek island, Sumire vanishes without a trace. Miu asks the narrator to fly out to the island and help with the search. Once there, he finds a handful of tantalizing clues: an odd conversation Miu and Sumire had about a spooked cat, a diary that Sumire kept on a floppy disk in which she writes of ""entering the world of dreams and never coming out. Living in dreams for the rest of time,"" and, strangest of all, Sumire's transcript of a secret Miu told her, the story of how Miu's black hair turned entirely white during a single night in a little Swiss town.

Murakami knows that the most haunting tales never have all their loose ends tied up by the last page, but unlike ""The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,"" ""Sputnik Sweetheart"" doesn't leave too many of them unspooled and dangling. It's a tighter book, if less grand and captivating, and the point of this exercise in the uncanny feels more focused. ""Why do people have to be this lonely?"" the narrator asks:

 

I closed my eyes and listened carefully for the descendants of Sputnik, even now circling the earth, gravity their only tie to the planet. Lonely metal souls in the unimpeded darkness of space, they meet, pass each other, and part, never to meet again. No words passing between them. No promises to keep.
Back in Japan, there will be a significant moment with a kleptomaniac child and a few more surprising encounters, but the lovely, sad, eerie Murakami spell remains firmly in place, the sense of its perfectly still center inviolate. It's still impossible to nail down, but its ingredients include loneliness, longing and an undeniable and sometimes frightening thread of the miraculous woven into the very fabric of life.

A direct and fundamentally optimistic indictment of the short-sightedness and intellectual arrogance that has characterized much of urban planning in this century, The Death and Life of Great American Cities has, since its first publication in 1961, become the standard against which all endeavors in that field are measured. In prose of outstanding immediacy, Jane Jacobs writes about what makes streets safe or unsafe; about what constitutes a neighborhood, and what function it serves within the larger organism of the city; about why some neighborhoods remain impoverished while others regenerate themselves. She writes about the salutary role of funeral parlors and tenement windows, the dangers of too much development money and too little diversity. Compassionate, bracingly indignant, and always keenly detailed, Jane Jacobs's monumental work provides an essential framework for assessing the vitality of all cities.(amazon.co.uk)",The Death and Life of Great American Cities,Jane Jacobs, , ,Vintage Books,9780679741954,"1st Edition,1992",480,India,English

Through an examination of old and new cosmological models, Roger Penrose sets out to prove, that the Big Bang was not the beginning of everything, nor will it be the end to everything.

In this book, Penrose offers a carefully detailed analysis of the second law of thermodynamics, stating that the universe is headed towards a total state of randomness.  Penrose further adds, with the passage of large amounts of time, mass breaks down, distances have no value, and our universe will continue to expand.

Penrose was primarily concerned with what occurred in the universe before the “Big Bang”? He combined conformal geometry with the theory of total randomness, to arrive at his central premise, being the ultimate fate of our randomly expanding universe is the precursor to the formation of a big bang.

The stunning debut novel from bestselling author Bill Clegg is a magnificently powerful story about a circle of people who find solace in the least likely of places as they cope with a horrific tragedy.

On the eve of her daughter's wedding, June Reid's life is completely devastated when a shocking disaster takes the lives of her daughter, her daughter's fiancé, her ex-husband, and her boyfriend, Luke - her entire family, all gone in a moment. And June is the only survivor. 

Alone and directionless, June drives across the country, away from her small Connecticut town. In her wake, a community emerges, weaving a beautiful and surprising web of connections through shared heartbreak. 

From the couple running a motel on the Pacific Ocean where June eventually settles into a quiet half-life, to the wedding's caterer whose bill has been forgotten, to Luke's mother, the shattered outcast of the town - everyone touched by the tragedy is changed as truths about their near and far histories finally come to light.

Rahul Pandita was fourteen years old when he was forced to leave his
home in Srinagar along with his family, who were Kashmiri Panditsthe Hindu minority within a Muslim-majority Kashmir that was by 1990
becoming increasingly agitated with the cries of 'Azaadi' from India.
The heartbreaking story of Kashmir has so far been told mainly through the prism of the brutality of the Indian security forces,
the pro-independence demands of Muslim separatists, or India and Pakistan's political rivalry. But there is another part of Kashmir's
history that has remained unrecorded and buried.
Our Moon Has Blood Clots is the untold chapter in the story of Kashmir, in which hundreds of thousands of Kashmiri Pandits were tortured, killed and forced to leave their homes by Islamist militants, and to spend the rest of their lives in exile in their own country. Rahul Pandita has written a deeply
personal, powerful and unforgettable story of history, home and loss.
