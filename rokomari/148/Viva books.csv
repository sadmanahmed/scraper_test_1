In Viva's Dictionary of Word Origins, Adrian Room shows, for example, that the word acorn has nothing to do with corn, as commonly supposed. The word is acutally related to acre, which is derived from the Latin ager, meaning “field.” Similarly, a blanket is not called that because it has no pattern-is blank-but because it was originally white and the word came into English from the French blanc. The words belfry, carnation, mosaic, salmonella, and saltcellar have nothing to do with bell, coronation, Moses, salmon, or cellar, but derive from very different origins. Viva's Dictionary of Word Origins shows what those origins are. 

In all, the origins of nearly 1200 words are given. Equally interesting the folk etymologies, or fictional origins, of words like butterfly, sirloin, and Welsh rabbit are also described. Informative and enjoyble, Viva's Dictionary of Word Origins offers hours of satisfying reading. It is an indispensable reference for all word lovers, librarians, educators, and, in fact, for anyone curious about the origins of English words.",Vivas Dictionary Of Word Origins,Adrian Room, , ,Viva books,9788185617749,"Reprinted,2005",194,India,English

‘Stretton provides a brilliant, critical and fresh look at the whole of economics. He points to the contradictions and the lack of realism in its current approaches. I cannot recommend this book too strongly.’ Paul Streeten, Boston University, founder of World Development journal. ‘Introduces the reader to the many different skills required in economics: analysis, a knowledge of history and institutions, philosophical concepts, quantitative precision, judgement, relevance and a sense of time and place.’ G.C. Harcourt, Cambridge University.

""The publication of this book is one of the most important events of the last ten years in economics. It is not a flimsy response to the stagnating orthodoxy, but a substantial quality alternative building upon solid philosophical foundations.""-Michael Keaney, Glasgow Caledonian University. Economics: A New Introduction provides a fresh introduction to real economics. Highlighting the complex and changing nature of economic activity, this wide-ranging text employs a pragmatic mix of old and new methods to examine the role of values and theoretical beliefs in economic life and in economists’ understanding of it.

It attends to the problems which have come with high productivity, rapidly changing technology and skills, changing proportions of earning and non-earning years in most people’s lives, and a faltering revolution in childhood and parenting which has brought stress and over-work for many women. It addresses such issues as rising poverty, inequality, insecurity and the slow progress of environmental reform. In focusing on such abuses of affluence the text draws on institutional, Keynesian, green and feminist theories, while emphasising all approaches to understanding economic life.

In Viva's Dictionary of Word Origins, Adrian Room shows, for example, that the word acorn has nothing to do with corn, as commonly supposed. The word is acutally related to acre, which is derived from the Latin ager, meaning “field.” Similarly, a blanket is not called that because it has no pattern-is blank-but because it was originally white and the word came into English from the French blanc. The words belfry, carnation, mosaic, salmonella, and saltcellar have nothing to do with bell, coronation, Moses, salmon, or cellar, but derive from very different origins. Viva's Dictionary of Word Origins shows what those origins are. 

In all, the origins of nearly 1200 words are given. Equally interesting the folk etymologies, or fictional origins, of words like butterfly, sirloin, and Welsh rabbit are also described. Informative and enjoyble, Viva's Dictionary of Word Origins offers hours of satisfying reading. It is an indispensable reference for all word lovers, librarians, educators, and, in fact, for anyone curious about the origins of English words.",Vivas Dictionary Of Word Origins,Adrian Room, , ,Viva books,9788185617749,"Reprinted,2005",194,India,English

‘Stretton provides a brilliant, critical and fresh look at the whole of economics. He points to the contradictions and the lack of realism in its current approaches. I cannot recommend this book too strongly.’ Paul Streeten, Boston University, founder of World Development journal. ‘Introduces the reader to the many different skills required in economics: analysis, a knowledge of history and institutions, philosophical concepts, quantitative precision, judgement, relevance and a sense of time and place.’ G.C. Harcourt, Cambridge University.

""The publication of this book is one of the most important events of the last ten years in economics. It is not a flimsy response to the stagnating orthodoxy, but a substantial quality alternative building upon solid philosophical foundations.""-Michael Keaney, Glasgow Caledonian University. Economics: A New Introduction provides a fresh introduction to real economics. Highlighting the complex and changing nature of economic activity, this wide-ranging text employs a pragmatic mix of old and new methods to examine the role of values and theoretical beliefs in economic life and in economists’ understanding of it.

It attends to the problems which have come with high productivity, rapidly changing technology and skills, changing proportions of earning and non-earning years in most people’s lives, and a faltering revolution in childhood and parenting which has brought stress and over-work for many women. It addresses such issues as rising poverty, inequality, insecurity and the slow progress of environmental reform. In focusing on such abuses of affluence the text draws on institutional, Keynesian, green and feminist theories, while emphasising all approaches to understanding economic life.

In order to do this various fundamental aspects of process biotechnology need to be understood adequately. This book in its third edition is intended for teaching senior or graduate level courses, and as a self-study text for practising biochemical engineers, biotechnologists, applied and industrial microbiologists, cell biologists, scientists involved in bioprocessing research and development and other related fields. It continues to give intensive quantitative training in the industrial practical applications of the principles of biosystems, and finding the solution of bioprocessing problems.

The book has the following unique features:*

    Integration of academic and practical bioprocessing principles towards process biotechnology development.*
    Research generated data never before published in a single collated text.*
    Detailed aspects of oxygen mass transfer in biological systems.*
    Ways to control undesirable microorganisms.*
    Provides scope for progressive development in scale up of industrial bioprocessing system.*
    Systematic design engineering calculations of bioprocessing systems.*
    Abundance of illustrative tables, figures and mathematical relations.*
    Numerous mathematical problems and multiple choice questions.
