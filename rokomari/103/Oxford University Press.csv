The text has been honed over seven editions, displaying a fluency, authority, and insight rarely found in textbooks, which makes the process of assimilating information effective and enjoyable.
The book provides an introduction to all the clinical topics, subspecialties, and major psychiatric conditions required by the trainee psychiatrist. Throughout, the authors emphasize the basic clinical skills required for full assessment and understanding of the patient. Discussion of treatment includes not only scientific evidence, but also practical problems in the management of patients in a family and social context.
Full attention to ethical and legal issues is given within the evidence-based approach to practice provided in the text. Introductory chapters focus on recognition of signs and symptoms, classification and diagnosis, psychiatric assessment, and aetiology. Further chapters deal with all the major psychiatric syndromes, as well as providing detailed coverage of pharmacological and psychological treatments. The book gives equal prominence to ICD-10 and DSM-5 classifications, making the book relevant to the practice of psychiatry throughout the world-a perspective enhanced by the addition of a new chapter on global mental health.
Boasting greater use of summary boxes, tables, and lists within a new modern design, the Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry remains the most up-to-date secondary level textbook of psychiatry available. The extensive bibliography has been updated, and there are targeted reading lists for each chapter. The Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry fulfils all the study and revision needs of psychiatric trainees, but will also prove useful to medical students, general practitioners, qualified psychiatrists, and those in related fields who need to be kept informed with current psychiatric practice.",Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry,"Paul Harrison,Philip Cowen,Tom Burns,Mina Fazel", , ,Oxford University Press,9780198747437,"7th Edition,2018",884,India,English

Amartya Sen advances the theory that lack of democracy and famines are interrelated; he cites the example of the Bengal famine of 1943, stating that it only occurred because of the lack of democracy in India under British rule. He further argues that the situation was aggravated by the British government's suspension of trade in rice and grains among various Indian provinces.


Olivier Rubin's review of the evidence disagrees with Sen; after examining the cases of post-Independence India, Niger, and Malawi, he finds that ""democracy is no panacea against famine."" Rubin's analysis questions whether democracy and a free press were sufficient to truly avert famine in 1967 and 1972 (the Maharashtra famine involved some 130,000 deaths), and notes that some dynamics of electoral democracy complicate rather than bring about famine relief efforts. Rubin does not address colonial period famines.

On the other hand, Andrew Banik's study Starvation and India's democracy affirms Sen's thesis, but indicates that while democracy has been able to prevent famines in India, it has not been sufficient to avoid severe under-nutrition and starvation deaths, which Banik calls a 'silent emergency' in the country.

Practicing medicine is not an easy task. Besides the complexity of the subject and the diverse conditions and medicines that have to be studied. there is an additional factor in this profession that makes it daunting. The doctors are directly responsible for lives.

As the authors point out, the scraps of practical wisdom thrown out by senior doctors during the years of internship and residency can be lost quickly from memory. So, when a situation arises when a particular piece of advice would have served well, the doctor cannot recall it.

Oxford Handbook Of Clinical Medicine collects and presents all the wisdom gained by the authors over years of practical experience. Besides this, they discuss the theory and principles of medicine. They explain how the practice of medicine has evolved over the ages.

Starting from the time of Hippocrates, to the modern era, the book presents changing views. Packed with information on all aspects of clinical medicine, from taking down patient history to prescribing dosages, the book provides practical advice for the new practitioner. It begins with essential skills like recording patient history and examination, providing useful tips on how to get the maximum information from the patient.

Neatly arranged so that readers can easily locate the information they want, this eighth edition has been revised to bring it up-to-date. Color tabs at the sides facilitate instant access to the relevant sections when something needs to be looked up.

This book, Concise Inorganic Chemistry, begins by covering SI units and nomenclatures in the Periodic table. Then, the subject content of the book is divided into six parts. After the main coverage, there is an extensive appendix section, a total of 15 appendices.

The six main parts are Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, The S-Block Elements, The P-Block elements, The D-Block Elements, The F-Block Elements, and Other Topics.

The first part, Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, consists of chapters such as atomic structure and the periodic table, introduction to bonding, the ionic bond, the covalent bond, the metallic bond, general properties of the elements, coordination compounds, and hydrogen and the hydrides.
Part two, The S-Block Element, covers group 1 - the alkali metals, the chlor-alkali industry, and group 2 - the alkaline earth elements. Part three, The P-Block Element, covers the group 13 elements, the group 14 elements, the group 15 elements, group 16 - the chalcogens, group 17 - the halogens, and group 18 - the noble gases.

Part four, The D-Block Elements, covers an introduction to the transition elements, group 3 - the scandium group, group 4 - the the titanium group, group 5 - the vanadium group, group 6 - the chromium group, group 7 - the manganese group, group 8 - iron group, group 9 - the cobalt group, group 10 - the nickel group, group 11 - the copper group, coinage metals, and group 12 - the zinc group.

Part five, The F-Block Element, covers the lanthanide series, and the actinides. Part seven, Other Topics, consists of the atomic nucleus and spectra.

There are a total of 15 appendices. These are A: Abundance of the elements in the Earth’s crust, B: Melting points of the elements, C: Boiling points of the elements, D: Densities of the solid and liquid elements, and E: Electronic structures of the elements.

The next five are F: Some average single bond energies, and some double and triple bond energies, G: Solubility of main group compounds in water, H: Atomic weights based on 12C = 12000, I: Values of some fundamental physical constants, and J: Electrical resistivity of the elements at the stated temperature.

The last five appendices are K: Top fifty chemicals in the USA, 1994, L: Inorganic chemicals manufactured in large tonnages worldwide, M: Minerals used in large amounts, N: Hardness of minerals - Mohs’ scale, and O: Standard textbooks.

The presentation is interesting, it is never dull or drab. The author uses the correct blend of theory and application, tilting more towards the practical rather than theoretical. This book is a good reference material for college and university courses, and can be used as preparation material for entrance exams for postgraduate courses.

""... India is blessed with several world religions and therefore no single religious establishment can be the counterpart of the secular edifice. Therefore, instead of keeping religion out of politics, we sensibly give equal respect to each religion. However, the question, as to what is religion remains ... The Triple Talaq case offered the opportunity to consider the very idea of religion, but the Court thought it appropriate not to dive into a metaphysical or philosophical exercise, limiting its attention to what might be described as the layman's religion. Yet somehow, it seems that drawing distinctions between the core or essential part of religion and the peripheral aspect cannot be attempted without an understanding of the nature of religion."" 
Triple talaq, or talaq-e-bidat, is one of the most debated issues in the Muslim world. From antiquity, the Muslim faith
has been plagued by the portrayal of Muslim men regularly misusing this perceived ""right"" to divorce their wives instantly by simply uttering ""talaq” thrice. The Supreme Court of India, in the landmark judgment of Shayara Bano v. Union of India, has taken the step to declare this form of talaq unconstitutional and to
strike down its practice. 
In Triple Talaq: Examining Faith, Salman Khurshid, who intervened to offer the court an amicus brief in the Triple Talaq case"", offers a straightforward yet comprehensive
overview of this complicated issue. Explaining the reasons behind the court's decision, he dives deep into other aspects of
this practice: why it is wrong; why it has thrived; what was the judicial history of this issue; what the Quran and Muslim religious leaders say about it; and what the comparative practices in other countries are. A handy guide to this landmark decision and what it means for Muslims in India, this book is written not just for the
theologian, but also for the common reader.

The text has been honed over seven editions, displaying a fluency, authority, and insight rarely found in textbooks, which makes the process of assimilating information effective and enjoyable.
The book provides an introduction to all the clinical topics, subspecialties, and major psychiatric conditions required by the trainee psychiatrist. Throughout, the authors emphasize the basic clinical skills required for full assessment and understanding of the patient. Discussion of treatment includes not only scientific evidence, but also practical problems in the management of patients in a family and social context.
Full attention to ethical and legal issues is given within the evidence-based approach to practice provided in the text. Introductory chapters focus on recognition of signs and symptoms, classification and diagnosis, psychiatric assessment, and aetiology. Further chapters deal with all the major psychiatric syndromes, as well as providing detailed coverage of pharmacological and psychological treatments. The book gives equal prominence to ICD-10 and DSM-5 classifications, making the book relevant to the practice of psychiatry throughout the world-a perspective enhanced by the addition of a new chapter on global mental health.
Boasting greater use of summary boxes, tables, and lists within a new modern design, the Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry remains the most up-to-date secondary level textbook of psychiatry available. The extensive bibliography has been updated, and there are targeted reading lists for each chapter. The Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry fulfils all the study and revision needs of psychiatric trainees, but will also prove useful to medical students, general practitioners, qualified psychiatrists, and those in related fields who need to be kept informed with current psychiatric practice.",Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry,"Paul Harrison,Philip Cowen,Tom Burns,Mina Fazel", , ,Oxford University Press,9780198747437,"7th Edition,2018",884,India,English

Amartya Sen advances the theory that lack of democracy and famines are interrelated; he cites the example of the Bengal famine of 1943, stating that it only occurred because of the lack of democracy in India under British rule. He further argues that the situation was aggravated by the British government's suspension of trade in rice and grains among various Indian provinces.


Olivier Rubin's review of the evidence disagrees with Sen; after examining the cases of post-Independence India, Niger, and Malawi, he finds that ""democracy is no panacea against famine."" Rubin's analysis questions whether democracy and a free press were sufficient to truly avert famine in 1967 and 1972 (the Maharashtra famine involved some 130,000 deaths), and notes that some dynamics of electoral democracy complicate rather than bring about famine relief efforts. Rubin does not address colonial period famines.

On the other hand, Andrew Banik's study Starvation and India's democracy affirms Sen's thesis, but indicates that while democracy has been able to prevent famines in India, it has not been sufficient to avoid severe under-nutrition and starvation deaths, which Banik calls a 'silent emergency' in the country.

Practicing medicine is not an easy task. Besides the complexity of the subject and the diverse conditions and medicines that have to be studied. there is an additional factor in this profession that makes it daunting. The doctors are directly responsible for lives.

As the authors point out, the scraps of practical wisdom thrown out by senior doctors during the years of internship and residency can be lost quickly from memory. So, when a situation arises when a particular piece of advice would have served well, the doctor cannot recall it.

Oxford Handbook Of Clinical Medicine collects and presents all the wisdom gained by the authors over years of practical experience. Besides this, they discuss the theory and principles of medicine. They explain how the practice of medicine has evolved over the ages.

Starting from the time of Hippocrates, to the modern era, the book presents changing views. Packed with information on all aspects of clinical medicine, from taking down patient history to prescribing dosages, the book provides practical advice for the new practitioner. It begins with essential skills like recording patient history and examination, providing useful tips on how to get the maximum information from the patient.

Neatly arranged so that readers can easily locate the information they want, this eighth edition has been revised to bring it up-to-date. Color tabs at the sides facilitate instant access to the relevant sections when something needs to be looked up.

This book, Concise Inorganic Chemistry, begins by covering SI units and nomenclatures in the Periodic table. Then, the subject content of the book is divided into six parts. After the main coverage, there is an extensive appendix section, a total of 15 appendices.

The six main parts are Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, The S-Block Elements, The P-Block elements, The D-Block Elements, The F-Block Elements, and Other Topics.

The first part, Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, consists of chapters such as atomic structure and the periodic table, introduction to bonding, the ionic bond, the covalent bond, the metallic bond, general properties of the elements, coordination compounds, and hydrogen and the hydrides.
Part two, The S-Block Element, covers group 1 - the alkali metals, the chlor-alkali industry, and group 2 - the alkaline earth elements. Part three, The P-Block Element, covers the group 13 elements, the group 14 elements, the group 15 elements, group 16 - the chalcogens, group 17 - the halogens, and group 18 - the noble gases.

Part four, The D-Block Elements, covers an introduction to the transition elements, group 3 - the scandium group, group 4 - the the titanium group, group 5 - the vanadium group, group 6 - the chromium group, group 7 - the manganese group, group 8 - iron group, group 9 - the cobalt group, group 10 - the nickel group, group 11 - the copper group, coinage metals, and group 12 - the zinc group.

Part five, The F-Block Element, covers the lanthanide series, and the actinides. Part seven, Other Topics, consists of the atomic nucleus and spectra.

There are a total of 15 appendices. These are A: Abundance of the elements in the Earth’s crust, B: Melting points of the elements, C: Boiling points of the elements, D: Densities of the solid and liquid elements, and E: Electronic structures of the elements.

The next five are F: Some average single bond energies, and some double and triple bond energies, G: Solubility of main group compounds in water, H: Atomic weights based on 12C = 12000, I: Values of some fundamental physical constants, and J: Electrical resistivity of the elements at the stated temperature.

The last five appendices are K: Top fifty chemicals in the USA, 1994, L: Inorganic chemicals manufactured in large tonnages worldwide, M: Minerals used in large amounts, N: Hardness of minerals - Mohs’ scale, and O: Standard textbooks.

The presentation is interesting, it is never dull or drab. The author uses the correct blend of theory and application, tilting more towards the practical rather than theoretical. This book is a good reference material for college and university courses, and can be used as preparation material for entrance exams for postgraduate courses.

""... India is blessed with several world religions and therefore no single religious establishment can be the counterpart of the secular edifice. Therefore, instead of keeping religion out of politics, we sensibly give equal respect to each religion. However, the question, as to what is religion remains ... The Triple Talaq case offered the opportunity to consider the very idea of religion, but the Court thought it appropriate not to dive into a metaphysical or philosophical exercise, limiting its attention to what might be described as the layman's religion. Yet somehow, it seems that drawing distinctions between the core or essential part of religion and the peripheral aspect cannot be attempted without an understanding of the nature of religion."" 
Triple talaq, or talaq-e-bidat, is one of the most debated issues in the Muslim world. From antiquity, the Muslim faith
has been plagued by the portrayal of Muslim men regularly misusing this perceived ""right"" to divorce their wives instantly by simply uttering ""talaq” thrice. The Supreme Court of India, in the landmark judgment of Shayara Bano v. Union of India, has taken the step to declare this form of talaq unconstitutional and to
strike down its practice. 
In Triple Talaq: Examining Faith, Salman Khurshid, who intervened to offer the court an amicus brief in the Triple Talaq case"", offers a straightforward yet comprehensive
overview of this complicated issue. Explaining the reasons behind the court's decision, he dives deep into other aspects of
this practice: why it is wrong; why it has thrived; what was the judicial history of this issue; what the Quran and Muslim religious leaders say about it; and what the comparative practices in other countries are. A handy guide to this landmark decision and what it means for Muslims in India, this book is written not just for the
theologian, but also for the common reader.

The text has been honed over seven editions, displaying a fluency, authority, and insight rarely found in textbooks, which makes the process of assimilating information effective and enjoyable.
The book provides an introduction to all the clinical topics, subspecialties, and major psychiatric conditions required by the trainee psychiatrist. Throughout, the authors emphasize the basic clinical skills required for full assessment and understanding of the patient. Discussion of treatment includes not only scientific evidence, but also practical problems in the management of patients in a family and social context.
Full attention to ethical and legal issues is given within the evidence-based approach to practice provided in the text. Introductory chapters focus on recognition of signs and symptoms, classification and diagnosis, psychiatric assessment, and aetiology. Further chapters deal with all the major psychiatric syndromes, as well as providing detailed coverage of pharmacological and psychological treatments. The book gives equal prominence to ICD-10 and DSM-5 classifications, making the book relevant to the practice of psychiatry throughout the world-a perspective enhanced by the addition of a new chapter on global mental health.
Boasting greater use of summary boxes, tables, and lists within a new modern design, the Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry remains the most up-to-date secondary level textbook of psychiatry available. The extensive bibliography has been updated, and there are targeted reading lists for each chapter. The Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry fulfils all the study and revision needs of psychiatric trainees, but will also prove useful to medical students, general practitioners, qualified psychiatrists, and those in related fields who need to be kept informed with current psychiatric practice.",Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry,"Paul Harrison,Philip Cowen,Tom Burns,Mina Fazel", , ,Oxford University Press,9780198747437,"7th Edition,2018",884,India,English

Oxford Learner's Pocket Dictionary by OUP is a dictionary that has been compiled for people who need a trusty companion that is handy enough to carry around. It is termed as a pocket dictionary owing to its size but has a collection of 30000 words, idioms, and phrases. The explanations that accompany every word are accurate and leave no room for ambiguity.  Widely used dialects and phrases have been explained in the dictionary and an attempt has also been made to dispel the wrong interpretation of words. Oxford dictionaries are always updated with newly recognized words so that the vocabulary covered is extensive. The words have been spelt both in American and British English to help readers frame sentences in a geographically correct manner. Stress has also been laid on the proper pronunciation of all words. This dictionary has been designed in a very user friendly manner and is compact, so that it can be carried around easily.",Oxford Learner's Pocket Grammar,John Eastwood, , ,Oxford University Press,9780194336840,"Published,2008",396,India,English

Amartya Sen advances the theory that lack of democracy and famines are interrelated; he cites the example of the Bengal famine of 1943, stating that it only occurred because of the lack of democracy in India under British rule. He further argues that the situation was aggravated by the British government's suspension of trade in rice and grains among various Indian provinces.


Olivier Rubin's review of the evidence disagrees with Sen; after examining the cases of post-Independence India, Niger, and Malawi, he finds that ""democracy is no panacea against famine."" Rubin's analysis questions whether democracy and a free press were sufficient to truly avert famine in 1967 and 1972 (the Maharashtra famine involved some 130,000 deaths), and notes that some dynamics of electoral democracy complicate rather than bring about famine relief efforts. Rubin does not address colonial period famines.

On the other hand, Andrew Banik's study Starvation and India's democracy affirms Sen's thesis, but indicates that while democracy has been able to prevent famines in India, it has not been sufficient to avoid severe under-nutrition and starvation deaths, which Banik calls a 'silent emergency' in the country.

Practicing medicine is not an easy task. Besides the complexity of the subject and the diverse conditions and medicines that have to be studied. there is an additional factor in this profession that makes it daunting. The doctors are directly responsible for lives.

As the authors point out, the scraps of practical wisdom thrown out by senior doctors during the years of internship and residency can be lost quickly from memory. So, when a situation arises when a particular piece of advice would have served well, the doctor cannot recall it.

Oxford Handbook Of Clinical Medicine collects and presents all the wisdom gained by the authors over years of practical experience. Besides this, they discuss the theory and principles of medicine. They explain how the practice of medicine has evolved over the ages.

Starting from the time of Hippocrates, to the modern era, the book presents changing views. Packed with information on all aspects of clinical medicine, from taking down patient history to prescribing dosages, the book provides practical advice for the new practitioner. It begins with essential skills like recording patient history and examination, providing useful tips on how to get the maximum information from the patient.

Neatly arranged so that readers can easily locate the information they want, this eighth edition has been revised to bring it up-to-date. Color tabs at the sides facilitate instant access to the relevant sections when something needs to be looked up.

This book, Concise Inorganic Chemistry, begins by covering SI units and nomenclatures in the Periodic table. Then, the subject content of the book is divided into six parts. After the main coverage, there is an extensive appendix section, a total of 15 appendices.

The six main parts are Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, The S-Block Elements, The P-Block elements, The D-Block Elements, The F-Block Elements, and Other Topics.

The first part, Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, consists of chapters such as atomic structure and the periodic table, introduction to bonding, the ionic bond, the covalent bond, the metallic bond, general properties of the elements, coordination compounds, and hydrogen and the hydrides.
Part two, The S-Block Element, covers group 1 - the alkali metals, the chlor-alkali industry, and group 2 - the alkaline earth elements. Part three, The P-Block Element, covers the group 13 elements, the group 14 elements, the group 15 elements, group 16 - the chalcogens, group 17 - the halogens, and group 18 - the noble gases.

Part four, The D-Block Elements, covers an introduction to the transition elements, group 3 - the scandium group, group 4 - the the titanium group, group 5 - the vanadium group, group 6 - the chromium group, group 7 - the manganese group, group 8 - iron group, group 9 - the cobalt group, group 10 - the nickel group, group 11 - the copper group, coinage metals, and group 12 - the zinc group.

Part five, The F-Block Element, covers the lanthanide series, and the actinides. Part seven, Other Topics, consists of the atomic nucleus and spectra.

There are a total of 15 appendices. These are A: Abundance of the elements in the Earth’s crust, B: Melting points of the elements, C: Boiling points of the elements, D: Densities of the solid and liquid elements, and E: Electronic structures of the elements.

The next five are F: Some average single bond energies, and some double and triple bond energies, G: Solubility of main group compounds in water, H: Atomic weights based on 12C = 12000, I: Values of some fundamental physical constants, and J: Electrical resistivity of the elements at the stated temperature.

The last five appendices are K: Top fifty chemicals in the USA, 1994, L: Inorganic chemicals manufactured in large tonnages worldwide, M: Minerals used in large amounts, N: Hardness of minerals - Mohs’ scale, and O: Standard textbooks.

The presentation is interesting, it is never dull or drab. The author uses the correct blend of theory and application, tilting more towards the practical rather than theoretical. This book is a good reference material for college and university courses, and can be used as preparation material for entrance exams for postgraduate courses.

""... India is blessed with several world religions and therefore no single religious establishment can be the counterpart of the secular edifice. Therefore, instead of keeping religion out of politics, we sensibly give equal respect to each religion. However, the question, as to what is religion remains ... The Triple Talaq case offered the opportunity to consider the very idea of religion, but the Court thought it appropriate not to dive into a metaphysical or philosophical exercise, limiting its attention to what might be described as the layman's religion. Yet somehow, it seems that drawing distinctions between the core or essential part of religion and the peripheral aspect cannot be attempted without an understanding of the nature of religion."" 
Triple talaq, or talaq-e-bidat, is one of the most debated issues in the Muslim world. From antiquity, the Muslim faith
has been plagued by the portrayal of Muslim men regularly misusing this perceived ""right"" to divorce their wives instantly by simply uttering ""talaq” thrice. The Supreme Court of India, in the landmark judgment of Shayara Bano v. Union of India, has taken the step to declare this form of talaq unconstitutional and to
strike down its practice. 
In Triple Talaq: Examining Faith, Salman Khurshid, who intervened to offer the court an amicus brief in the Triple Talaq case"", offers a straightforward yet comprehensive
overview of this complicated issue. Explaining the reasons behind the court's decision, he dives deep into other aspects of
this practice: why it is wrong; why it has thrived; what was the judicial history of this issue; what the Quran and Muslim religious leaders say about it; and what the comparative practices in other countries are. A handy guide to this landmark decision and what it means for Muslims in India, this book is written not just for the
theologian, but also for the common reader.

The text has been honed over seven editions, displaying a fluency, authority, and insight rarely found in textbooks, which makes the process of assimilating information effective and enjoyable.
The book provides an introduction to all the clinical topics, subspecialties, and major psychiatric conditions required by the trainee psychiatrist. Throughout, the authors emphasize the basic clinical skills required for full assessment and understanding of the patient. Discussion of treatment includes not only scientific evidence, but also practical problems in the management of patients in a family and social context.
Full attention to ethical and legal issues is given within the evidence-based approach to practice provided in the text. Introductory chapters focus on recognition of signs and symptoms, classification and diagnosis, psychiatric assessment, and aetiology. Further chapters deal with all the major psychiatric syndromes, as well as providing detailed coverage of pharmacological and psychological treatments. The book gives equal prominence to ICD-10 and DSM-5 classifications, making the book relevant to the practice of psychiatry throughout the world-a perspective enhanced by the addition of a new chapter on global mental health.
Boasting greater use of summary boxes, tables, and lists within a new modern design, the Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry remains the most up-to-date secondary level textbook of psychiatry available. The extensive bibliography has been updated, and there are targeted reading lists for each chapter. The Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry fulfils all the study and revision needs of psychiatric trainees, but will also prove useful to medical students, general practitioners, qualified psychiatrists, and those in related fields who need to be kept informed with current psychiatric practice.",Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry,"Paul Harrison,Philip Cowen,Tom Burns,Mina Fazel", , ,Oxford University Press,9780198747437,"7th Edition,2018",884,India,English

Amartya Sen advances the theory that lack of democracy and famines are interrelated; he cites the example of the Bengal famine of 1943, stating that it only occurred because of the lack of democracy in India under British rule. He further argues that the situation was aggravated by the British government's suspension of trade in rice and grains among various Indian provinces.


Olivier Rubin's review of the evidence disagrees with Sen; after examining the cases of post-Independence India, Niger, and Malawi, he finds that ""democracy is no panacea against famine."" Rubin's analysis questions whether democracy and a free press were sufficient to truly avert famine in 1967 and 1972 (the Maharashtra famine involved some 130,000 deaths), and notes that some dynamics of electoral democracy complicate rather than bring about famine relief efforts. Rubin does not address colonial period famines.

On the other hand, Andrew Banik's study Starvation and India's democracy affirms Sen's thesis, but indicates that while democracy has been able to prevent famines in India, it has not been sufficient to avoid severe under-nutrition and starvation deaths, which Banik calls a 'silent emergency' in the country.

Practicing medicine is not an easy task. Besides the complexity of the subject and the diverse conditions and medicines that have to be studied. there is an additional factor in this profession that makes it daunting. The doctors are directly responsible for lives.

As the authors point out, the scraps of practical wisdom thrown out by senior doctors during the years of internship and residency can be lost quickly from memory. So, when a situation arises when a particular piece of advice would have served well, the doctor cannot recall it.

Oxford Handbook Of Clinical Medicine collects and presents all the wisdom gained by the authors over years of practical experience. Besides this, they discuss the theory and principles of medicine. They explain how the practice of medicine has evolved over the ages.

Starting from the time of Hippocrates, to the modern era, the book presents changing views. Packed with information on all aspects of clinical medicine, from taking down patient history to prescribing dosages, the book provides practical advice for the new practitioner. It begins with essential skills like recording patient history and examination, providing useful tips on how to get the maximum information from the patient.

Neatly arranged so that readers can easily locate the information they want, this eighth edition has been revised to bring it up-to-date. Color tabs at the sides facilitate instant access to the relevant sections when something needs to be looked up.

This book, Concise Inorganic Chemistry, begins by covering SI units and nomenclatures in the Periodic table. Then, the subject content of the book is divided into six parts. After the main coverage, there is an extensive appendix section, a total of 15 appendices.

The six main parts are Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, The S-Block Elements, The P-Block elements, The D-Block Elements, The F-Block Elements, and Other Topics.

The first part, Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, consists of chapters such as atomic structure and the periodic table, introduction to bonding, the ionic bond, the covalent bond, the metallic bond, general properties of the elements, coordination compounds, and hydrogen and the hydrides.
Part two, The S-Block Element, covers group 1 - the alkali metals, the chlor-alkali industry, and group 2 - the alkaline earth elements. Part three, The P-Block Element, covers the group 13 elements, the group 14 elements, the group 15 elements, group 16 - the chalcogens, group 17 - the halogens, and group 18 - the noble gases.

Part four, The D-Block Elements, covers an introduction to the transition elements, group 3 - the scandium group, group 4 - the the titanium group, group 5 - the vanadium group, group 6 - the chromium group, group 7 - the manganese group, group 8 - iron group, group 9 - the cobalt group, group 10 - the nickel group, group 11 - the copper group, coinage metals, and group 12 - the zinc group.

Part five, The F-Block Element, covers the lanthanide series, and the actinides. Part seven, Other Topics, consists of the atomic nucleus and spectra.

There are a total of 15 appendices. These are A: Abundance of the elements in the Earth’s crust, B: Melting points of the elements, C: Boiling points of the elements, D: Densities of the solid and liquid elements, and E: Electronic structures of the elements.

The next five are F: Some average single bond energies, and some double and triple bond energies, G: Solubility of main group compounds in water, H: Atomic weights based on 12C = 12000, I: Values of some fundamental physical constants, and J: Electrical resistivity of the elements at the stated temperature.

The last five appendices are K: Top fifty chemicals in the USA, 1994, L: Inorganic chemicals manufactured in large tonnages worldwide, M: Minerals used in large amounts, N: Hardness of minerals - Mohs’ scale, and O: Standard textbooks.

The presentation is interesting, it is never dull or drab. The author uses the correct blend of theory and application, tilting more towards the practical rather than theoretical. This book is a good reference material for college and university courses, and can be used as preparation material for entrance exams for postgraduate courses.

""... India is blessed with several world religions and therefore no single religious establishment can be the counterpart of the secular edifice. Therefore, instead of keeping religion out of politics, we sensibly give equal respect to each religion. However, the question, as to what is religion remains ... The Triple Talaq case offered the opportunity to consider the very idea of religion, but the Court thought it appropriate not to dive into a metaphysical or philosophical exercise, limiting its attention to what might be described as the layman's religion. Yet somehow, it seems that drawing distinctions between the core or essential part of religion and the peripheral aspect cannot be attempted without an understanding of the nature of religion."" 
Triple talaq, or talaq-e-bidat, is one of the most debated issues in the Muslim world. From antiquity, the Muslim faith
has been plagued by the portrayal of Muslim men regularly misusing this perceived ""right"" to divorce their wives instantly by simply uttering ""talaq” thrice. The Supreme Court of India, in the landmark judgment of Shayara Bano v. Union of India, has taken the step to declare this form of talaq unconstitutional and to
strike down its practice. 
In Triple Talaq: Examining Faith, Salman Khurshid, who intervened to offer the court an amicus brief in the Triple Talaq case"", offers a straightforward yet comprehensive
overview of this complicated issue. Explaining the reasons behind the court's decision, he dives deep into other aspects of
this practice: why it is wrong; why it has thrived; what was the judicial history of this issue; what the Quran and Muslim religious leaders say about it; and what the comparative practices in other countries are. A handy guide to this landmark decision and what it means for Muslims in India, this book is written not just for the
theologian, but also for the common reader.

The text has been honed over seven editions, displaying a fluency, authority, and insight rarely found in textbooks, which makes the process of assimilating information effective and enjoyable.
The book provides an introduction to all the clinical topics, subspecialties, and major psychiatric conditions required by the trainee psychiatrist. Throughout, the authors emphasize the basic clinical skills required for full assessment and understanding of the patient. Discussion of treatment includes not only scientific evidence, but also practical problems in the management of patients in a family and social context.
Full attention to ethical and legal issues is given within the evidence-based approach to practice provided in the text. Introductory chapters focus on recognition of signs and symptoms, classification and diagnosis, psychiatric assessment, and aetiology. Further chapters deal with all the major psychiatric syndromes, as well as providing detailed coverage of pharmacological and psychological treatments. The book gives equal prominence to ICD-10 and DSM-5 classifications, making the book relevant to the practice of psychiatry throughout the world-a perspective enhanced by the addition of a new chapter on global mental health.
Boasting greater use of summary boxes, tables, and lists within a new modern design, the Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry remains the most up-to-date secondary level textbook of psychiatry available.

Amartya Sen advances the theory that lack of democracy and famines are interrelated; he cites the example of the Bengal famine of 1943, stating that it only occurred because of the lack of democracy in India under British rule. He further argues that the situation was aggravated by the British government's suspension of trade in rice and grains among various Indian provinces.


Olivier Rubin's review of the evidence disagrees with Sen; after examining the cases of post-Independence India, Niger, and Malawi, he finds that ""democracy is no panacea against famine."" Rubin's analysis questions whether democracy and a free press were sufficient to truly avert famine in 1967 and 1972 (the Maharashtra famine involved some 130,000 deaths), and notes that some dynamics of electoral democracy complicate rather than bring about famine relief efforts. Rubin does not address colonial period famines.

On the other hand, Andrew Banik's study Starvation and India's democracy affirms Sen's thesis, but indicates that while democracy has been able to prevent famines in India, it has not been sufficient to avoid severe under-nutrition and starvation deaths, which Banik calls a 'silent emergency' in the country.

Practicing medicine is not an easy task. Besides the complexity of the subject and the diverse conditions and medicines that have to be studied. there is an additional factor in this profession that makes it daunting. The doctors are directly responsible for lives.

As the authors point out, the scraps of practical wisdom thrown out by senior doctors during the years of internship and residency can be lost quickly from memory. So, when a situation arises when a particular piece of advice would have served well, the doctor cannot recall it.

Oxford Handbook Of Clinical Medicine collects and presents all the wisdom gained by the authors over years of practical experience. Besides this, they discuss the theory and principles of medicine. They explain how the practice of medicine has evolved over the ages.

Starting from the time of Hippocrates, to the modern era, the book presents changing views. Packed with information on all aspects of clinical medicine, from taking down patient history to prescribing dosages, the book provides practical advice for the new practitioner. It begins with essential skills like recording patient history and examination, providing useful tips on how to get the maximum information from the patient.

Neatly arranged so that readers can easily locate the information they want, this eighth edition has been revised to bring it up-to-date. Color tabs at the sides facilitate instant access to the relevant sections when something needs to be looked up.

This book, Concise Inorganic Chemistry, begins by covering SI units and nomenclatures in the Periodic table. Then, the subject content of the book is divided into six parts. After the main coverage, there is an extensive appendix section, a total of 15 appendices.

The six main parts are Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, The S-Block Elements, The P-Block elements, The D-Block Elements, The F-Block Elements, and Other Topics.

The first part, Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, consists of chapters such as atomic structure and the periodic table, introduction to bonding, the ionic bond, the covalent bond, the metallic bond, general properties of the elements, coordination compounds, and hydrogen and the hydrides.
Part two, The S-Block Element, covers group 1 - the alkali metals, the chlor-alkali industry, and group 2 - the alkaline earth elements. Part three, The P-Block Element, covers the group 13 elements, the group 14 elements, the group 15 elements, group 16 - the chalcogens, group 17 - the halogens, and group 18 - the noble gases.

Part four, The D-Block Elements, covers an introduction to the transition elements, group 3 - the scandium group, group 4 - the the titanium group, group 5 - the vanadium group, group 6 - the chromium group, group 7 - the manganese group, group 8 - iron group, group 9 - the cobalt group, group 10 - the nickel group, group 11 - the copper group, coinage metals, and group 12 - the zinc group.

Part five, The F-Block Element, covers the lanthanide series, and the actinides. Part seven, Other Topics, consists of the atomic nucleus and spectra.

There are a total of 15 appendices. These are A: Abundance of the elements in the Earth’s crust, B: Melting points of the elements, C: Boiling points of the elements, D: Densities of the solid and liquid elements, and E: Electronic structures of the elements.

The next five are F: Some average single bond energies, and some double and triple bond energies, G: Solubility of main group compounds in water, H: Atomic weights based on 12C = 12000, I: Values of some fundamental physical constants, and J: Electrical resistivity of the elements at the stated temperature.

The last five appendices are K: Top fifty chemicals in the USA, 1994, L: Inorganic chemicals manufactured in large tonnages worldwide, M: Minerals used in large amounts, N: Hardness of minerals - Mohs’ scale, and O: Standard textbooks.

The presentation is interesting, it is never dull or drab. The author uses the correct blend of theory and application, tilting more towards the practical rather than theoretical. This book is a good reference material for college and university courses, and can be used as preparation material for entrance exams for postgraduate courses.

Triple Talaq,সালমান খুরশিদ,TK. 720,"",https://rokomari.com//book/159999/triple-talaq,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/7a703de4d_159999.jpg,"Information Of Flap:
""... India is blessed with several world religions and therefore no single religious establishment can be the counterpart of the secular edifice. Therefore, instead of keeping religion out of politics, we sensibly give equal respect to each religion. However, the question, as to what is religion remains ... The Triple Talaq case offered the opportunity to consider the very idea of religion, but the Court thought it appropriate not to dive into a metaphysical or philosophical exercise, limiting its attention to what might be described as the layman's religion. Yet somehow, it seems that drawing distinctions between the core or essential part of religion and the peripheral aspect cannot be attempted without an understanding of the nature of religion."" 
Triple talaq, or talaq-e-bidat, is one of the most debated issues in the Muslim world. From antiquity, the Muslim faith
has been plagued by the portrayal of Muslim men regularly misusing this perceived ""right"" to divorce their wives instantly by simply uttering ""talaq” thrice. The Supreme Court of India, in the landmark judgment of Shayara Bano v. Union of India, has taken the step to declare this form of talaq unconstitutional and to
strike down its practice. 
In Triple Talaq: Examining Faith, Salman Khurshid, who intervened to offer the court an amicus brief in the Triple Talaq case"", offers a straightforward yet comprehensive
overview of this complicated issue. Explaining the reasons behind the court's decision, he dives deep into other aspects of
this practice: why it is wrong; why it has thrived; what was the judicial history of this issue; what the Quran and Muslim religious leaders say about it; and what the comparative practices in other countries are. A handy guide to this landmark decision and what it means for Muslims in India, this book is written not just for the
theologian, but also for the common reader.

The text has been honed over seven editions, displaying a fluency, authority, and insight rarely found in textbooks, which makes the process of assimilating information effective and enjoyable.
The book provides an introduction to all the clinical topics, subspecialties, and major psychiatric conditions required by the trainee psychiatrist. Throughout, the authors emphasize the basic clinical skills required for full assessment and understanding of the patient. Discussion of treatment includes not only scientific evidence, but also practical problems in the management of patients in a family and social context.
Full attention to ethical and legal issues is given within the evidence-based approach to practice provided in the text. Introductory chapters focus on recognition of signs and symptoms, classification and diagnosis, psychiatric assessment, and aetiology. Further chapters deal with all the major psychiatric syndromes, as well as providing detailed coverage of pharmacological and psychological treatments. The book gives equal prominence to ICD-10 and DSM-5 classifications, making the book relevant to the practice of psychiatry throughout the world-a perspective enhanced by the addition of a new chapter on global mental health.
Boasting greater use of summary boxes, tables, and lists within a new modern design, the Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry remains the most up-to-date secondary level textbook of psychiatry available. The extensive bibliography has been updated, and there are targeted reading lists for each chapter. The Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry fulfils all the study and revision needs of psychiatric trainees, but will also prove useful to medical students, general practitioners, qualified psychiatrists, and those in related fields who need to be kept informed with current psychiatric practice.",Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry,"Paul Harrison,Philip Cowen,Tom Burns,Mina Fazel", , ,Oxford University Press,9780198747437,"7th Edition,2018",884,India,English

Oxford Learner's Pocket Dictionary by OUP is a dictionary that has been compiled for people who need a trusty companion that is handy enough to carry around. It is termed as a pocket dictionary owing to its size but has a collection of 30000 words, idioms, and phrases. The explanations that accompany every word are accurate and leave no room for ambiguity.  Widely used dialects and phrases have been explained in the dictionary and an attempt has also been made to dispel the wrong interpretation of words. Oxford dictionaries are always updated with newly recognized words so that the vocabulary covered is extensive. The words have been spelt both in American and British English to help readers frame sentences in a geographically correct manner. Stress has also been laid on the proper pronunciation of all words.

Amartya Sen advances the theory that lack of democracy and famines are interrelated; he cites the example of the Bengal famine of 1943, stating that it only occurred because of the lack of democracy in India under British rule. He further argues that the situation was aggravated by the British government's suspension of trade in rice and grains among various Indian provinces.


Olivier Rubin's review of the evidence disagrees with Sen; after examining the cases of post-Independence India, Niger, and Malawi, he finds that ""democracy is no panacea against famine."" Rubin's analysis questions whether democracy and a free press were sufficient to truly avert famine in 1967 and 1972 (the Maharashtra famine involved some 130,000 deaths), and notes that some dynamics of electoral democracy complicate rather than bring about famine relief efforts. Rubin does not address colonial period famines.

On the other hand, Andrew Banik's study Starvation and India's democracy affirms Sen's thesis, but indicates that while democracy has been able to prevent famines in India, it has not been sufficient to avoid severe under-nutrition and starvation deaths, which Banik calls a 'silent emergency' in the country.

Practicing medicine is not an easy task. Besides the complexity of the subject and the diverse conditions and medicines that have to be studied. there is an additional factor in this profession that makes it daunting. The doctors are directly responsible for lives.

As the authors point out, the scraps of practical wisdom thrown out by senior doctors during the years of internship and residency can be lost quickly from memory. So, when a situation arises when a particular piece of advice would have served well, the doctor cannot recall it.

Oxford Handbook Of Clinical Medicine collects and presents all the wisdom gained by the authors over years of practical experience. Besides this, they discuss the theory and principles of medicine. They explain how the practice of medicine has evolved over the ages.

Starting from the time of Hippocrates, to the modern era, the book presents changing views. Packed with information on all aspects of clinical medicine, from taking down patient history to prescribing dosages, the book provides practical advice for the new practitioner. It begins with essential skills like recording patient history and examination, providing useful tips on how to get the maximum information from the patient.

Neatly arranged so that readers can easily locate the information they want, this eighth edition has been revised to bring it up-to-date. Color tabs at the sides facilitate instant access to the relevant sections when something needs to be looked up.

This book, Concise Inorganic Chemistry, begins by covering SI units and nomenclatures in the Periodic table. Then, the subject content of the book is divided into six parts. After the main coverage, there is an extensive appendix section, a total of 15 appendices.

The six main parts are Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, The S-Block Elements, The P-Block elements, The D-Block Elements, The F-Block Elements, and Other Topics.

The first part, Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, consists of chapters such as atomic structure and the periodic table, introduction to bonding, the ionic bond, the covalent bond, the metallic bond, general properties of the elements, coordination compounds, and hydrogen and the hydrides.
Part two, The S-Block Element, covers group 1 - the alkali metals, the chlor-alkali industry, and group 2 - the alkaline earth elements. Part three, The P-Block Element, covers the group 13 elements, the group 14 elements, the group 15 elements, group 16 - the chalcogens, group 17 - the halogens, and group 18 - the noble gases.

Part four, The D-Block Elements, covers an introduction to the transition elements, group 3 - the scandium group, group 4 - the the titanium group, group 5 - the vanadium group, group 6 - the chromium group, group 7 - the manganese group, group 8 - iron group, group 9 - the cobalt group, group 10 - the nickel group, group 11 - the copper group, coinage metals, and group 12 - the zinc group.

Part five, The F-Block Element, covers the lanthanide series, and the actinides. Part seven, Other Topics, consists of the atomic nucleus and spectra.

There are a total of 15 appendices. These are A: Abundance of the elements in the Earth’s crust, B: Melting points of the elements, C: Boiling points of the elements, D: Densities of the solid and liquid elements, and E: Electronic structures of the elements.

The next five are F: Some average single bond energies, and some double and triple bond energies, G: Solubility of main group compounds in water, H: Atomic weights based on 12C = 12000, I: Values of some fundamental physical constants, and J: Electrical resistivity of the elements at the stated temperature.

The last five appendices are K: Top fifty chemicals in the USA, 1994, L: Inorganic chemicals manufactured in large tonnages worldwide, M: Minerals used in large amounts, N: Hardness of minerals - Mohs’ scale, and O: Standard textbooks.

The presentation is interesting, it is never dull or drab. The author uses the correct blend of theory and application, tilting more towards the practical rather than theoretical. This book is a good reference material for college and university courses, and can be used as preparation material for entrance exams for postgraduate courses.

""... India is blessed with several world religions and therefore no single religious establishment can be the counterpart of the secular edifice. Therefore, instead of keeping religion out of politics, we sensibly give equal respect to each religion. However, the question, as to what is religion remains ... The Triple Talaq case offered the opportunity to consider the very idea of religion, but the Court thought it appropriate not to dive into a metaphysical or philosophical exercise, limiting its attention to what might be described as the layman's religion. Yet somehow, it seems that drawing distinctions between the core or essential part of religion and the peripheral aspect cannot be attempted without an understanding of the nature of religion."" 
Triple talaq, or talaq-e-bidat, is one of the most debated issues in the Muslim world. From antiquity, the Muslim faith
has been plagued by the portrayal of Muslim men regularly misusing this perceived ""right"" to divorce their wives instantly by simply uttering ""talaq” thrice. The Supreme Court of India, in the landmark judgment of Shayara Bano v. Union of India, has taken the step to declare this form of talaq unconstitutional and to
strike down its practice. 
In Triple Talaq: Examining Faith, Salman Khurshid, who intervened to offer the court an amicus brief in the Triple Talaq case"", offers a straightforward yet comprehensive
overview of this complicated issue. Explaining the reasons behind the court's decision, he dives deep into other aspects of
this practice: why it is wrong; why it has thrived; what was the judicial history of this issue; what the Quran and Muslim religious leaders say about it; and what the comparative practices in other countries are. A handy guide to this landmark decision and what it means for Muslims in India, this book is written not just for the
theologian, but also for the common reader.

The text has been honed over seven editions, displaying a fluency, authority, and insight rarely found in textbooks, which makes the process of assimilating information effective and enjoyable.
The book provides an introduction to all the clinical topics, subspecialties, and major psychiatric conditions required by the trainee psychiatrist. Throughout, the authors emphasize the basic clinical skills required for full assessment and understanding of the patient. Discussion of treatment includes not only scientific evidence, but also practical problems in the management of patients in a family and social context.
Full attention to ethical and legal issues is given within the evidence-based approach to practice provided in the text. Introductory chapters focus on recognition of signs and symptoms, classification and diagnosis, psychiatric assessment, and aetiology. Further chapters deal with all the major psychiatric syndromes, as well as providing detailed coverage of pharmacological and psychological treatments. The book gives equal prominence to ICD-10 and DSM-5 classifications, making the book relevant to the practice of psychiatry throughout the world-a perspective enhanced by the addition of a new chapter on global mental health.
Boasting greater use of summary boxes, tables, and lists within a new modern design, the Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry remains the most up-to-date secondary level textbook of psychiatry available. The extensive bibliography has been updated, and there are targeted reading lists for each chapter. The Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry fulfils all the study and revision needs of psychiatric trainees, but will also prove useful to medical students, general practitioners, qualified psychiatrists, and those in related fields who need to be kept informed with current psychiatric practice.",Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry,"Paul Harrison,Philip Cowen,Tom Burns,Mina Fazel", , ,Oxford University Press,9780198747437,"7th Edition,2018",884,India,English

Amartya Sen advances the theory that lack of democracy and famines are interrelated; he cites the example of the Bengal famine of 1943, stating that it only occurred because of the lack of democracy in India under British rule. He further argues that the situation was aggravated by the British government's suspension of trade in rice and grains among various Indian provinces.


Olivier Rubin's review of the evidence disagrees with Sen; after examining the cases of post-Independence India, Niger, and Malawi, he finds that ""democracy is no panacea against famine."" Rubin's analysis questions whether democracy and a free press were sufficient to truly avert famine in 1967 and 1972 (the Maharashtra famine involved some 130,000 deaths), and notes that some dynamics of electoral democracy complicate rather than bring about famine relief efforts. Rubin does not address colonial period famines.

On the other hand, Andrew Banik's study Starvation and India's democracy affirms Sen's thesis, but indicates that while democracy has been able to prevent famines in India, it has not been sufficient to avoid severe under-nutrition and starvation deaths, which Banik calls a 'silent emergency' in the country.


According to a FEWSNET report, ""Famines are not natural phenomena, they are catastrophic political failures.""",Poverty and Famines,Amartya Sen, , ,Oxford University Press,9780195649543,"1st Edition,1998",270,Abroad,English

Practicing medicine is not an easy task. Besides the complexity of the subject and the diverse conditions and medicines that have to be studied. there is an additional factor in this profession that makes it daunting. The doctors are directly responsible for lives.

As the authors point out, the scraps of practical wisdom thrown out by senior doctors during the years of internship and residency can be lost quickly from memory. So, when a situation arises when a particular piece of advice would have served well, the doctor cannot recall it.

Oxford Handbook Of Clinical Medicine collects and presents all the wisdom gained by the authors over years of practical experience. Besides this, they discuss the theory and principles of medicine. They explain how the practice of medicine has evolved over the ages.

Starting from the time of Hippocrates, to the modern era, the book presents changing views. Packed with information on all aspects of clinical medicine, from taking down patient history to prescribing dosages, the book provides practical advice for the new practitioner. It begins with essential skills like recording patient history and examination, providing useful tips on how to get the maximum information from the patient.

Neatly arranged so that readers can easily locate the information they want, this eighth edition has been revised to bring it up-to-date. Color tabs at the sides facilitate instant access to the relevant sections when something needs to be looked up.

This book, Concise Inorganic Chemistry, begins by covering SI units and nomenclatures in the Periodic table. Then, the subject content of the book is divided into six parts. After the main coverage, there is an extensive appendix section, a total of 15 appendices.

The six main parts are Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, The S-Block Elements, The P-Block elements, The D-Block Elements, The F-Block Elements, and Other Topics.

The first part, Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, consists of chapters such as atomic structure and the periodic table, introduction to bonding, the ionic bond, the covalent bond, the metallic bond, general properties of the elements, coordination compounds, and hydrogen and the hydrides.
Part two, The S-Block Element, covers group 1 - the alkali metals, the chlor-alkali industry, and group 2 - the alkaline earth elements. Part three, The P-Block Element, covers the group 13 elements, the group 14 elements, the group 15 elements, group 16 - the chalcogens, group 17 - the halogens, and group 18 - the noble gases.

Part four, The D-Block Elements, covers an introduction to the transition elements, group 3 - the scandium group, group 4 - the the titanium group, group 5 - the vanadium group, group 6 - the chromium group, group 7 - the manganese group, group 8 - iron group, group 9 - the cobalt group, group 10 - the nickel group, group 11 - the copper group, coinage metals, and group 12 - the zinc group.

Part five, The F-Block Element, covers the lanthanide series, and the actinides. Part seven, Other Topics, consists of the atomic nucleus and spectra.

There are a total of 15 appendices. These are A: Abundance of the elements in the Earth’s crust, B: Melting points of the elements, C: Boiling points of the elements, D: Densities of the solid and liquid elements, and E: Electronic structures of the elements.

The next five are F: Some average single bond energies, and some double and triple bond energies, G: Solubility of main group compounds in water, H: Atomic weights based on 12C = 12000, I: Values of some fundamental physical constants, and J: Electrical resistivity of the elements at the stated temperature.

The last five appendices are K: Top fifty chemicals in the USA, 1994, L: Inorganic chemicals manufactured in large tonnages worldwide, M: Minerals used in large amounts, N: Hardness of minerals - Mohs’ scale, and O: Standard textbooks.

The presentation is interesting, it is never dull or drab. The author uses the correct blend of theory and application, tilting more towards the practical rather than theoretical. This book is a good reference material for college and university courses, and can be used as preparation material for entrance exams for postgraduate courses.

""... India is blessed with several world religions and therefore no single religious establishment can be the counterpart of the secular edifice. Therefore, instead of keeping religion out of politics, we sensibly give equal respect to each religion. However, the question, as to what is religion remains ... The Triple Talaq case offered the opportunity to consider the very idea of religion, but the Court thought it appropriate not to dive into a metaphysical or philosophical exercise, limiting its attention to what might be described as the layman's religion. Yet somehow, it seems that drawing distinctions between the core or essential part of religion and the peripheral aspect cannot be attempted without an understanding of the nature of religion."" 
Triple talaq, or talaq-e-bidat, is one of the most debated issues in the Muslim world. From antiquity, the Muslim faith
has been plagued by the portrayal of Muslim men regularly misusing this perceived ""right"" to divorce their wives instantly by simply uttering ""talaq” thrice. The Supreme Court of India, in the landmark judgment of Shayara Bano v. Union of India, has taken the step to declare this form of talaq unconstitutional and to
strike down its practice. 
In Triple Talaq: Examining Faith, Salman Khurshid, who intervened to offer the court an amicus brief in the Triple Talaq case"", offers a straightforward yet comprehensive
overview of this complicated issue. Explaining the reasons behind the court's decision, he dives deep into other aspects of
this practice: why it is wrong; why it has thrived; what was the judicial history of this issue; what the Quran and Muslim religious leaders say about it; and what the comparative practices in other countries are. A handy guide to this landmark decision and what it means for Muslims in India, this book is written not just for the
theologian, but also for the common reader.

The text has been honed over seven editions, displaying a fluency, authority, and insight rarely found in textbooks, which makes the process of assimilating information effective and enjoyable.
The book provides an introduction to all the clinical topics, subspecialties, and major psychiatric conditions required by the trainee psychiatrist. Throughout, the authors emphasize the basic clinical skills required for full assessment and understanding of the patient. Discussion of treatment includes not only scientific evidence, but also practical problems in the management of patients in a family and social context.
Full attention to ethical and legal issues is given within the evidence-based approach to practice provided in the text. Introductory chapters focus on recognition of signs and symptoms, classification and diagnosis, psychiatric assessment, and aetiology. Further chapters deal with all the major psychiatric syndromes, as well as providing detailed coverage of pharmacological and psychological treatments. The book gives equal prominence to ICD-10 and DSM-5 classifications, making the book relevant to the practice of psychiatry throughout the world-a perspective enhanced by the addition of a new chapter on global mental health.
Boasting greater use of summary boxes, tables, and lists within a new modern design, the Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry remains the most up-to-date secondary level textbook of psychiatry available. The extensive bibliography has been updated, and there are targeted reading lists for each chapter. The Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry fulfils all the study and revision needs of psychiatric trainees, but will also prove useful to medical students, general practitioners, qualified psychiatrists, and those in related fields who need to be kept informed with current psychiatric practice.",Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry,"Paul Harrison,Philip Cowen,Tom Burns,Mina Fazel", , ,Oxford University Press,9780198747437,"7th Edition,2018",884,India,English

Amartya Sen advances the theory that lack of democracy and famines are interrelated; he cites the example of the Bengal famine of 1943, stating that it only occurred because of the lack of democracy in India under British rule. He further argues that the situation was aggravated by the British government's suspension of trade in rice and grains among various Indian provinces.


Olivier Rubin's review of the evidence disagrees with Sen; after examining the cases of post-Independence India, Niger, and Malawi, he finds that ""democracy is no panacea against famine."" Rubin's analysis questions whether democracy and a free press were sufficient to truly avert famine in 1967 and 1972 (the Maharashtra famine involved some 130,000 deaths), and notes that some dynamics of electoral democracy complicate rather than bring about famine relief efforts. Rubin does not address colonial period famines.

On the other hand, Andrew Banik's study Starvation and India's democracy affirms Sen's thesis, but indicates that while democracy has been able to prevent famines in India, it has not been sufficient to avoid severe under-nutrition and starvation deaths, which Banik calls a 'silent emergency' in the country.

Practicing medicine is not an easy task. Besides the complexity of the subject and the diverse conditions and medicines that have to be studied. there is an additional factor in this profession that makes it daunting. The doctors are directly responsible for lives.

As the authors point out, the scraps of practical wisdom thrown out by senior doctors during the years of internship and residency can be lost quickly from memory. So, when a situation arises when a particular piece of advice would have served well, the doctor cannot recall it.

Oxford Handbook Of Clinical Medicine collects and presents all the wisdom gained by the authors over years of practical experience. Besides this, they discuss the theory and principles of medicine. They explain how the practice of medicine has evolved over the ages.

Starting from the time of Hippocrates, to the modern era, the book presents changing views. Packed with information on all aspects of clinical medicine, from taking down patient history to prescribing dosages, the book provides practical advice for the new practitioner. It begins with essential skills like recording patient history and examination, providing useful tips on how to get the maximum information from the patient.

Neatly arranged so that readers can easily locate the information they want, this eighth edition has been revised to bring it up-to-date. Color tabs at the sides facilitate instant access to the relevant sections when something needs to be looked up.

This book, Concise Inorganic Chemistry, begins by covering SI units and nomenclatures in the Periodic table. Then, the subject content of the book is divided into six parts. After the main coverage, there is an extensive appendix section, a total of 15 appendices.

The six main parts are Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, The S-Block Elements, The P-Block elements, The D-Block Elements, The F-Block Elements, and Other Topics.

The first part, Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, consists of chapters such as atomic structure and the periodic table, introduction to bonding, the ionic bond, the covalent bond, the metallic bond, general properties of the elements, coordination compounds, and hydrogen and the hydrides.
Part two, The S-Block Element, covers group 1 - the alkali metals, the chlor-alkali industry, and group 2 - the alkaline earth elements. Part three, The P-Block Element, covers the group 13 elements, the group 14 elements, the group 15 elements, group 16 - the chalcogens, group 17 - the halogens, and group 18 - the noble gases.

Part four, The D-Block Elements, covers an introduction to the transition elements, group 3 - the scandium group, group 4 - the the titanium group, group 5 - the vanadium group, group 6 - the chromium group, group 7 - the manganese group, group 8 - iron group, group 9 - the cobalt group, group 10 - the nickel group, group 11 - the copper group, coinage metals, and group 12 - the zinc group.

Part five, The F-Block Element, covers the lanthanide series, and the actinides. Part seven, Other Topics, consists of the atomic nucleus and spectra.

There are a total of 15 appendices. These are A: Abundance of the elements in the Earth’s crust, B: Melting points of the elements, C: Boiling points of the elements, D: Densities of the solid and liquid elements, and E: Electronic structures of the elements.

The next five are F: Some average single bond energies, and some double and triple bond energies, G: Solubility of main group compounds in water, H: Atomic weights based on 12C = 12000, I: Values of some fundamental physical constants, and J: Electrical resistivity of the elements at the stated temperature.

The last five appendices are K: Top fifty chemicals in the USA, 1994, L: Inorganic chemicals manufactured in large tonnages worldwide, M: Minerals used in large amounts, N: Hardness of minerals - Mohs’ scale, and O: Standard textbooks.

The presentation is interesting, it is never dull or drab. The author uses the correct blend of theory and application, tilting more towards the practical rather than theoretical. This book is a good reference material for college and university courses, and can be used as preparation material for entrance exams for postgraduate courses.

""... India is blessed with several world religions and therefore no single religious establishment can be the counterpart of the secular edifice. Therefore, instead of keeping religion out of politics, we sensibly give equal respect to each religion. However, the question, as to what is religion remains ... The Triple Talaq case offered the opportunity to consider the very idea of religion, but the Court thought it appropriate not to dive into a metaphysical or philosophical exercise, limiting its attention to what might be described as the layman's religion. Yet somehow, it seems that drawing distinctions between the core or essential part of religion and the peripheral aspect cannot be attempted without an understanding of the nature of religion."" 
Triple talaq, or talaq-e-bidat, is one of the most debated issues in the Muslim world. From antiquity, the Muslim faith
has been plagued by the portrayal of Muslim men regularly misusing this perceived ""right"" to divorce their wives instantly by simply uttering ""talaq” thrice. The Supreme Court of India, in the landmark judgment of Shayara Bano v. Union of India, has taken the step to declare this form of talaq unconstitutional and to
strike down its practice. 
In Triple Talaq: Examining Faith, Salman Khurshid, who intervened to offer the court an amicus brief in the Triple Talaq case"", offers a straightforward yet comprehensive
overview of this complicated issue. Explaining the reasons behind the court's decision, he dives deep into other aspects of
this practice: why it is wrong; why it has thrived; what was the judicial history of this issue; what the Quran and Muslim religious leaders say about it; and what the comparative practices in other countries are. A handy guide to this landmark decision and what it means for Muslims in India, this book is written not just for the
theologian, but also for the common reader.

The text has been honed over seven editions, displaying a fluency, authority, and insight rarely found in textbooks, which makes the process of assimilating information effective and enjoyable.
The book provides an introduction to all the clinical topics, subspecialties, and major psychiatric conditions required by the trainee psychiatrist. Throughout, the authors emphasize the basic clinical skills required for full assessment and understanding of the patient. Discussion of treatment includes not only scientific evidence, but also practical problems in the management of patients in a family and social context.
Full attention to ethical and legal issues is given within the evidence-based approach to practice provided in the text. Introductory chapters focus on recognition of signs and symptoms, classification and diagnosis, psychiatric assessment, and aetiology. Further chapters deal with all the major psychiatric syndromes, as well as providing detailed coverage of pharmacological and psychological treatments. The book gives equal prominence to ICD-10 and DSM-5 classifications, making the book relevant to the practice of psychiatry throughout the world-a perspective enhanced by the addition of a new chapter on global mental health.
Boasting greater use of summary boxes, tables, and lists within a new modern design, the Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry remains the most up-to-date secondary level textbook of psychiatry available. The extensive bibliography has been updated, and there are targeted reading lists for each chapter. The Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry fulfils all the study and revision needs of psychiatric trainees, but will also prove useful to medical students, general practitioners, qualified psychiatrists, and those in related fields who need to be kept informed with current psychiatric practice.",Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry,"Paul Harrison,Philip Cowen,Tom Burns,Mina Fazel", , ,Oxford University Press,9780198747437,"7th Edition,2018",884,India,English

Amartya Sen advances the theory that lack of democracy and famines are interrelated; he cites the example of the Bengal famine of 1943, stating that it only occurred because of the lack of democracy in India under British rule. He further argues that the situation was aggravated by the British government's suspension of trade in rice and grains among various Indian provinces.


Olivier Rubin's review of the evidence disagrees with Sen; after examining the cases of post-Independence India, Niger, and Malawi, he finds that ""democracy is no panacea against famine."" Rubin's analysis questions whether democracy and a free press were sufficient to truly avert famine in 1967 and 1972 (the Maharashtra famine involved some 130,000 deaths), and notes that some dynamics of electoral democracy complicate rather than bring about famine relief efforts. Rubin does not address colonial period famines.

On the other hand, Andrew Banik's study Starvation and India's democracy affirms Sen's thesis, but indicates that while democracy has been able to prevent famines in India, it has not been sufficient to avoid severe under-nutrition and starvation deaths, which Banik calls a 'silent emergency' in the country.

Practicing medicine is not an easy task. Besides the complexity of the subject and the diverse conditions and medicines that have to be studied. there is an additional factor in this profession that makes it daunting. The doctors are directly responsible for lives.

As the authors point out, the scraps of practical wisdom thrown out by senior doctors during the years of internship and residency can be lost quickly from memory. So, when a situation arises when a particular piece of advice would have served well, the doctor cannot recall it.

Oxford Handbook Of Clinical Medicine collects and presents all the wisdom gained by the authors over years of practical experience. Besides this, they discuss the theory and principles of medicine. They explain how the practice of medicine has evolved over the ages.

Starting from the time of Hippocrates, to the modern era, the book presents changing views. Packed with information on all aspects of clinical medicine, from taking down patient history to prescribing dosages, the book provides practical advice for the new practitioner. It begins with essential skills like recording patient history and examination, providing useful tips on how to get the maximum information from the patient.

Neatly arranged so that readers can easily locate the information they want, this eighth edition has been revised to bring it up-to-date. Color tabs at the sides facilitate instant access to the relevant sections when something needs to be looked up.

This book, Concise Inorganic Chemistry, begins by covering SI units and nomenclatures in the Periodic table. Then, the subject content of the book is divided into six parts. After the main coverage, there is an extensive appendix section, a total of 15 appendices.

The six main parts are Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, The S-Block Elements, The P-Block elements, The D-Block Elements, The F-Block Elements, and Other Topics.

The first part, Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, consists of chapters such as atomic structure and the periodic table, introduction to bonding, the ionic bond, the covalent bond, the metallic bond, general properties of the elements, coordination compounds, and hydrogen and the hydrides.
Part two, The S-Block Element, covers group 1 - the alkali metals, the chlor-alkali industry, and group 2 - the alkaline earth elements. Part three, The P-Block Element, covers the group 13 elements, the group 14 elements, the group 15 elements, group 16 - the chalcogens, group 17 - the halogens, and group 18 - the noble gases.

Part four, The D-Block Elements, covers an introduction to the transition elements, group 3 - the scandium group, group 4 - the the titanium group, group 5 - the vanadium group, group 6 - the chromium group, group 7 - the manganese group, group 8 - iron group, group 9 - the cobalt group, group 10 - the nickel group, group 11 - the copper group, coinage metals, and group 12 - the zinc group.

Part five, The F-Block Element, covers the lanthanide series, and the actinides. Part seven, Other Topics, consists of the atomic nucleus and spectra.

There are a total of 15 appendices. These are A: Abundance of the elements in the Earth’s crust, B: Melting points of the elements, C: Boiling points of the elements, D: Densities of the solid and liquid elements, and E: Electronic structures of the elements.

The next five are F: Some average single bond energies, and some double and triple bond energies, G: Solubility of main group compounds in water, H: Atomic weights based on 12C = 12000, I: Values of some fundamental physical constants, and J: Electrical resistivity of the elements at the stated temperature.

The last five appendices are K: Top fifty chemicals in the USA, 1994, L: Inorganic chemicals manufactured in large tonnages worldwide, M: Minerals used in large amounts, N: Hardness of minerals - Mohs’ scale, and O: Standard textbooks.

The presentation is interesting, it is never dull or drab. The author uses the correct blend of theory and application, tilting more towards the practical rather than theoretical. This book is a good reference material for college and university courses, and can be used as preparation material for entrance exams for postgraduate courses.

Yet somehow, it seems that drawing distinctions between the core or essential part of religion and the peripheral aspect cannot be attempted without an understanding of the nature of religion."" 
Triple talaq, or talaq-e-bidat, is one of the most debated issues in the Muslim world. From antiquity, the Muslim faith
has been plagued by the portrayal of Muslim men regularly misusing this perceived ""right"" to divorce their wives instantly by simply uttering ""talaq” thrice. The Supreme Court of India, in the landmark judgment of Shayara Bano v. Union of India, has taken the step to declare this form of talaq unconstitutional and to
strike down its practice. 
In Triple Talaq: Examining Faith, Salman Khurshid, who intervened to offer the court an amicus brief in the Triple Talaq case"", offers a straightforward yet comprehensive
overview of this complicated issue. Explaining the reasons behind the court's decision, he dives deep into other aspects of
this practice: why it is wrong; why it has thrived; what was the judicial history of this issue; what the Quran and Muslim religious leaders say about it; and what the comparative practices in other countries are. A handy guide to this landmark decision and what it means for Muslims in India, this book is written not just for the
theologian, but also for the common reader.

The text has been honed over seven editions, displaying a fluency, authority, and insight rarely found in textbooks, which makes the process of assimilating information effective and enjoyable.
The book provides an introduction to all the clinical topics, subspecialties, and major psychiatric conditions required by the trainee psychiatrist. Throughout, the authors emphasize the basic clinical skills required for full assessment and understanding of the patient. Discussion of treatment includes not only scientific evidence, but also practical problems in the management of patients in a family and social context.
Full attention to ethical and legal issues is given within the evidence-based approach to practice provided in the text. Introductory chapters focus on recognition of signs and symptoms, classification and diagnosis, psychiatric assessment, and aetiology. Further chapters deal with all the major psychiatric syndromes, as well as providing detailed coverage of pharmacological and psychological treatments. The book gives equal prominence to ICD-10 and DSM-5 classifications, making the book relevant to the practice of psychiatry throughout the world-a perspective enhanced by the addition of a new chapter on global mental health.
Boasting greater use of summary boxes, tables, and lists within a new modern design, the Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry remains the most up-to-date secondary level textbook of psychiatry available. The extensive bibliography has been updated, and there are targeted reading lists for each chapter. The Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry fulfils all the study and revision needs of psychiatric trainees, but will also prove useful to medical students, general practitioners, qualified psychiatrists, and those in related fields who need to be kept informed with current psychiatric practice.",Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry,"Paul Harrison,Philip Cowen,Tom Burns,Mina Fazel", , ,Oxford University Press,9780198747437,"7th Edition,2018",884,India,English

Oxford Learner's Pocket Dictionary by OUP is a dictionary that has been compiled for people who need a trusty companion that is handy enough to carry around. It is termed as a pocket dictionary owing to its size but has a collection of 30000 words, idioms, and phrases. The explanations that accompany every word are accurate and leave no room for ambiguity.  Widely used dialects and phrases have been explained in the dictionary and an attempt has also been made to dispel the wrong interpretation of words. Oxford dictionaries are always updated with newly recognized words so that the vocabulary covered is extensive. The words have been spelt both in American and British English to help readers frame sentences in a geographically correct manner. Stress has also been laid on the proper pronunciation of all words. This dictionary has been designed in a very user friendly manner and is compact, so that it can be carried around easily.",Oxford Learner's Pocket Grammar,John Eastwood, , ,Oxford University Press,9780194336840,"Published,2008",396,India,English

Amartya Sen advances the theory that lack of democracy and famines are interrelated; he cites the example of the Bengal famine of 1943, stating that it only occurred because of the lack of democracy in India under British rule. He further argues that the situation was aggravated by the British government's suspension of trade in rice and grains among various Indian provinces.


Olivier Rubin's review of the evidence disagrees with Sen; after examining the cases of post-Independence India, Niger, and Malawi, he finds that ""democracy is no panacea against famine."" Rubin's analysis questions whether democracy and a free press were sufficient to truly avert famine in 1967 and 1972 (the Maharashtra famine involved some 130,000 deaths), and notes that some dynamics of electoral democracy complicate rather than bring about famine relief efforts. Rubin does not address colonial period famines.

On the other hand, Andrew Banik's study Starvation and India's democracy affirms Sen's thesis, but indicates that while democracy has been able to prevent famines in India, it has not been sufficient to avoid severe under-nutrition and starvation deaths, which Banik calls a 'silent emergency' in the country.

Practicing medicine is not an easy task. Besides the complexity of the subject and the diverse conditions and medicines that have to be studied. there is an additional factor in this profession that makes it daunting. The doctors are directly responsible for lives.

As the authors point out, the scraps of practical wisdom thrown out by senior doctors during the years of internship and residency can be lost quickly from memory. So, when a situation arises when a particular piece of advice would have served well, the doctor cannot recall it.

Oxford Handbook Of Clinical Medicine collects and presents all the wisdom gained by the authors over years of practical experience. Besides this, they discuss the theory and principles of medicine. They explain how the practice of medicine has evolved over the ages.

Starting from the time of Hippocrates, to the modern era, the book presents changing views. Packed with information on all aspects of clinical medicine, from taking down patient history to prescribing dosages, the book provides practical advice for the new practitioner. It begins with essential skills like recording patient history and examination, providing useful tips on how to get the maximum information from the patient.

Neatly arranged so that readers can easily locate the information they want, this eighth edition has been revised to bring it up-to-date. Color tabs at the sides facilitate instant access to the relevant sections when something needs to be looked up.

This book, Concise Inorganic Chemistry, begins by covering SI units and nomenclatures in the Periodic table. Then, the subject content of the book is divided into six parts. After the main coverage, there is an extensive appendix section, a total of 15 appendices.

The six main parts are Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, The S-Block Elements, The P-Block elements, The D-Block Elements, The F-Block Elements, and Other Topics.

The first part, Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, consists of chapters such as atomic structure and the periodic table, introduction to bonding, the ionic bond, the covalent bond, the metallic bond, general properties of the elements, coordination compounds, and hydrogen and the hydrides.
Part two, The S-Block Element, covers group 1 - the alkali metals, the chlor-alkali industry, and group 2 - the alkaline earth elements. Part three, The P-Block Element, covers the group 13 elements, the group 14 elements, the group 15 elements, group 16 - the chalcogens, group 17 - the halogens, and group 18 - the noble gases.

Part four, The D-Block Elements, covers an introduction to the transition elements, group 3 - the scandium group, group 4 - the the titanium group, group 5 - the vanadium group, group 6 - the chromium group, group 7 - the manganese group, group 8 - iron group, group 9 - the cobalt group, group 10 - the nickel group, group 11 - the copper group, coinage metals, and group 12 - the zinc group.

Part five, The F-Block Element, covers the lanthanide series, and the actinides. Part seven, Other Topics, consists of the atomic nucleus and spectra.

There are a total of 15 appendices. These are A: Abundance of the elements in the Earth’s crust, B: Melting points of the elements, C: Boiling points of the elements, D: Densities of the solid and liquid elements, and E: Electronic structures of the elements.

The next five are F: Some average single bond energies, and some double and triple bond energies, G: Solubility of main group compounds in water, H: Atomic weights based on 12C = 12000, I: Values of some fundamental physical constants, and J: Electrical resistivity of the elements at the stated temperature.

The last five appendices are K: Top fifty chemicals in the USA, 1994, L: Inorganic chemicals manufactured in large tonnages worldwide, M: Minerals used in large amounts, N: Hardness of minerals - Mohs’ scale, and O: Standard textbooks.

The presentation is interesting, it is never dull or drab. The author uses the correct blend of theory and application, tilting more towards the practical rather than theoretical. This book is a good reference material for college and university courses, and can be used as preparation material for entrance exams for postgraduate courses.

""... India is blessed with several world religions and therefore no single religious establishment can be the counterpart of the secular edifice. Therefore, instead of keeping religion out of politics, we sensibly give equal respect to each religion. However, the question, as to what is religion remains ... The Triple Talaq case offered the opportunity to consider the very idea of religion, but the Court thought it appropriate not to dive into a metaphysical or philosophical exercise, limiting its attention to what might be described as the layman's religion. Yet somehow, it seems that drawing distinctions between the core or essential part of religion and the peripheral aspect cannot be attempted without an understanding of the nature of religion."" 
Triple talaq, or talaq-e-bidat, is one of the most debated issues in the Muslim world. From antiquity, the Muslim faith
has been plagued by the portrayal of Muslim men regularly misusing this perceived ""right"" to divorce their wives instantly by simply uttering ""talaq” thrice. The Supreme Court of India, in the landmark judgment of Shayara Bano v. Union of India, has taken the step to declare this form of talaq unconstitutional and to
strike down its practice. 
In Triple Talaq: Examining Faith, Salman Khurshid, who intervened to offer the court an amicus brief in the Triple Talaq case"", offers a straightforward yet comprehensive
overview of this complicated issue. Explaining the reasons behind the court's decision, he dives deep into other aspects of
this practice: why it is wrong; why it has thrived; what was the judicial history of this issue; what the Quran and Muslim religious leaders say about it; and what the comparative practices in other countries are. A handy guide to this landmark decision and what it means for Muslims in India, this book is written not just for the
theologian, but also for the common reader.

The text has been honed over seven editions, displaying a fluency, authority, and insight rarely found in textbooks, which makes the process of assimilating information effective and enjoyable.
The book provides an introduction to all the clinical topics, subspecialties, and major psychiatric conditions required by the trainee psychiatrist. Throughout, the authors emphasize the basic clinical skills required for full assessment and understanding of the patient. Discussion of treatment includes not only scientific evidence, but also practical problems in the management of patients in a family and social context.
Full attention to ethical and legal issues is given within the evidence-based approach to practice provided in the text. Introductory chapters focus on recognition of signs and symptoms, classification and diagnosis, psychiatric assessment, and aetiology. Further chapters deal with all the major psychiatric syndromes, as well as providing detailed coverage of pharmacological and psychological treatments. The book gives equal prominence to ICD-10 and DSM-5 classifications, making the book relevant to the practice of psychiatry throughout the world-a perspective enhanced by the addition of a new chapter on global mental health.
Boasting greater use of summary boxes, tables, and lists within a new modern design, the Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry remains the most up-to-date secondary level textbook of psychiatry available. The extensive bibliography has been updated, and there are targeted reading lists for each chapter. The Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry fulfils all the study and revision needs of psychiatric trainees, but will also prove useful to medical students, general practitioners, qualified psychiatrists, and those in related fields who need to be kept informed with current psychiatric practice.",Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry,"Paul Harrison,Philip Cowen,Tom Burns,Mina Fazel", , ,Oxford University Press,9780198747437,"7th Edition,2018",884,India,English

Amartya Sen advances the theory that lack of democracy and famines are interrelated; he cites the example of the Bengal famine of 1943, stating that it only occurred because of the lack of democracy in India under British rule. He further argues that the situation was aggravated by the British government's suspension of trade in rice and grains among various Indian provinces.


Olivier Rubin's review of the evidence disagrees with Sen; after examining the cases of post-Independence India, Niger, and Malawi, he finds that ""democracy is no panacea against famine."" Rubin's analysis questions whether democracy and a free press were sufficient to truly avert famine in 1967 and 1972 (the Maharashtra famine involved some 130,000 deaths), and notes that some dynamics of electoral democracy complicate rather than bring about famine relief efforts. Rubin does not address colonial period famines.

On the other hand, Andrew Banik's study Starvation and India's democracy affirms Sen's thesis, but indicates that while democracy has been able to prevent famines in India, it has not been sufficient to avoid severe under-nutrition and starvation deaths, which Banik calls a 'silent emergency' in the country.

Practicing medicine is not an easy task. Besides the complexity of the subject and the diverse conditions and medicines that have to be studied. there is an additional factor in this profession that makes it daunting. The doctors are directly responsible for lives.

As the authors point out, the scraps of practical wisdom thrown out by senior doctors during the years of internship and residency can be lost quickly from memory. So, when a situation arises when a particular piece of advice would have served well, the doctor cannot recall it.

Oxford Handbook Of Clinical Medicine collects and presents all the wisdom gained by the authors over years of practical experience. Besides this, they discuss the theory and principles of medicine. They explain how the practice of medicine has evolved over the ages.

Starting from the time of Hippocrates, to the modern era, the book presents changing views. Packed with information on all aspects of clinical medicine, from taking down patient history to prescribing dosages, the book provides practical advice for the new practitioner. It begins with essential skills like recording patient history and examination, providing useful tips on how to get the maximum information from the patient.

Neatly arranged so that readers can easily locate the information they want, this eighth edition has been revised to bring it up-to-date. Color tabs at the sides facilitate instant access to the relevant sections when something needs to be looked up.

""... India is blessed with several world religions and therefore no single religious establishment can be the counterpart of the secular edifice. Therefore, instead of keeping religion out of politics, we sensibly give equal respect to each religion. However, the question, as to what is religion remains ... The Triple Talaq case offered the opportunity to consider the very idea of religion, but the Court thought it appropriate not to dive into a metaphysical or philosophical exercise, limiting its attention to what might be described as the layman's religion. Yet somehow, it seems that drawing distinctions between the core or essential part of religion and the peripheral aspect cannot be attempted without an understanding of the nature of religion."" 
Triple talaq, or talaq-e-bidat, is one of the most debated issues in the Muslim world. From antiquity, the Muslim faith
has been plagued by the portrayal of Muslim men regularly misusing this perceived ""right"" to divorce their wives instantly by simply uttering ""talaq” thrice. The Supreme Court of India, in the landmark judgment of Shayara Bano v. Union of India, has taken the step to declare this form of talaq unconstitutional and to
strike down its practice. 
In Triple Talaq: Examining Faith, Salman Khurshid, who intervened to offer the court an amicus brief in the Triple Talaq case"", offers a straightforward yet comprehensive
overview of this complicated issue. Explaining the reasons behind the court's decision, he dives deep into other aspects of
this practice: why it is wrong; why it has thrived; what was the judicial history of this issue; what the Quran and Muslim religious leaders say about it; and what the comparative practices in other countries are. A handy guide to this landmark decision and what it means for Muslims in India, this book is written not just for the
theologian, but also for the common reader.

The text has been honed over seven editions, displaying a fluency, authority, and insight rarely found in textbooks, which makes the process of assimilating information effective and enjoyable.
The book provides an introduction to all the clinical topics, subspecialties, and major psychiatric conditions required by the trainee psychiatrist. Throughout, the authors emphasize the basic clinical skills required for full assessment and understanding of the patient. Discussion of treatment includes not only scientific evidence, but also practical problems in the management of patients in a family and social context.
Full attention to ethical and legal issues is given within the evidence-based approach to practice provided in the text. Introductory chapters focus on recognition of signs and symptoms, classification and diagnosis, psychiatric assessment, and aetiology. Further chapters deal with all the major psychiatric syndromes, as well as providing detailed coverage of pharmacological and psychological treatments. The book gives equal prominence to ICD-10 and DSM-5 classifications, making the book relevant to the practice of psychiatry throughout the world-a perspective enhanced by the addition of a new chapter on global mental health.
Boasting greater use of summary boxes, tables, and lists within a new modern design, the Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry remains the most up-to-date secondary level textbook of psychiatry available. The extensive bibliography has been updated, and there are targeted reading lists for each chapter. The Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry fulfils all the study and revision needs of psychiatric trainees, but will also prove useful to medical students, general practitioners, qualified psychiatrists, and those in related fields who need to be kept informed with current psychiatric practice.",Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry,"Paul Harrison,Philip Cowen,Tom Burns,Mina Fazel", , ,Oxford University Press,9780198747437,"7th Edition,2018",884,India,English

Amartya Sen advances the theory that lack of democracy and famines are interrelated; he cites the example of the Bengal famine of 1943, stating that it only occurred because of the lack of democracy in India under British rule. He further argues that the situation was aggravated by the British government's suspension of trade in rice and grains among various Indian provinces.


Olivier Rubin's review of the evidence disagrees with Sen; after examining the cases of post-Independence India, Niger, and Malawi, he finds that ""democracy is no panacea against famine."" Rubin's analysis questions whether democracy and a free press were sufficient to truly avert famine in 1967 and 1972 (the Maharashtra famine involved some 130,000 deaths), and notes that some dynamics of electoral democracy complicate rather than bring about famine relief efforts. Rubin does not address colonial period famines.

On the other hand, Andrew Banik's study Starvation and India's democracy affirms Sen's thesis, but indicates that while democracy has been able to prevent famines in India, it has not been sufficient to avoid severe under-nutrition and starvation deaths, which Banik calls a 'silent emergency' in the country.

Practicing medicine is not an easy task. Besides the complexity of the subject and the diverse conditions and medicines that have to be studied. there is an additional factor in this profession that makes it daunting. The doctors are directly responsible for lives.

As the authors point out, the scraps of practical wisdom thrown out by senior doctors during the years of internship and residency can be lost quickly from memory. So, when a situation arises when a particular piece of advice would have served well, the doctor cannot recall it.

Oxford Handbook Of Clinical Medicine collects and presents all the wisdom gained by the authors over years of practical experience. Besides this, they discuss the theory and principles of medicine. They explain how the practice of medicine has evolved over the ages.

Starting from the time of Hippocrates, to the modern era, the book presents changing views. Packed with information on all aspects of clinical medicine, from taking down patient history to prescribing dosages, the book provides practical advice for the new practitioner. It begins with essential skills like recording patient history and examination, providing useful tips on how to get the maximum information from the patient.

Neatly arranged so that readers can easily locate the information they want, this eighth edition has been revised to bring it up-to-date. Color tabs at the sides facilitate instant access to the relevant sections when something needs to be looked up.

This book, Concise Inorganic Chemistry, begins by covering SI units and nomenclatures in the Periodic table. Then, the subject content of the book is divided into six parts. After the main coverage, there is an extensive appendix section, a total of 15 appendices.

The six main parts are Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, The S-Block Elements, The P-Block elements, The D-Block Elements, The F-Block Elements, and Other Topics.

The first part, Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, consists of chapters such as atomic structure and the periodic table, introduction to bonding, the ionic bond, the covalent bond, the metallic bond, general properties of the elements, coordination compounds, and hydrogen and the hydrides.
Part two, The S-Block Element, covers group 1 - the alkali metals, the chlor-alkali industry, and group 2 - the alkaline earth elements. Part three, The P-Block Element, covers the group 13 elements, the group 14 elements, the group 15 elements, group 16 - the chalcogens, group 17 - the halogens, and group 18 - the noble gases.

Part four, The D-Block Elements, covers an introduction to the transition elements, group 3 - the scandium group, group 4 - the the titanium group, group 5 - the vanadium group, group 6 - the chromium group, group 7 - the manganese group, group 8 - iron group, group 9 - the cobalt group, group 10 - the nickel group, group 11 - the copper group, coinage metals, and group 12 - the zinc group.

Part five, The F-Block Element, covers the lanthanide series, and the actinides. Part seven, Other Topics, consists of the atomic nucleus and spectra.

There are a total of 15 appendices. These are A: Abundance of the elements in the Earth’s crust, B: Melting points of the elements, C: Boiling points of the elements, D: Densities of the solid and liquid elements, and E: Electronic structures of the elements.

The next five are F: Some average single bond energies, and some double and triple bond energies, G: Solubility of main group compounds in water, H: Atomic weights based on 12C = 12000, I: Values of some fundamental physical constants, and J: Electrical resistivity of the elements at the stated temperature.

The last five appendices are K: Top fifty chemicals in the USA, 1994, L: Inorganic chemicals manufactured in large tonnages worldwide, M: Minerals used in large amounts, N: Hardness of minerals - Mohs’ scale, and O: Standard textbooks.

The presentation is interesting, it is never dull or drab. The author uses the correct blend of theory and application, tilting more towards the practical rather than theoretical. This book is a good reference material for college and university courses, and can be used as preparation material for entrance exams for postgraduate courses.

""... India is blessed with several world religions and therefore no single religious establishment can be the counterpart of the secular edifice. Therefore, instead of keeping religion out of politics, we sensibly give equal respect to each religion. However, the question, as to what is religion remains ... The Triple Talaq case offered the opportunity to consider the very idea of religion, but the Court thought it appropriate not to dive into a metaphysical or philosophical exercise, limiting its attention to what might be described as the layman's religion. Yet somehow, it seems that drawing distinctions between the core or essential part of religion and the peripheral aspect cannot be attempted without an understanding of the nature of religion."" 
Triple talaq, or talaq-e-bidat, is one of the most debated issues in the Muslim world. From antiquity, the Muslim faith
has been plagued by the portrayal of Muslim men regularly misusing this perceived ""right"" to divorce their wives instantly by simply uttering ""talaq” thrice. The Supreme Court of India, in the landmark judgment of Shayara Bano v. Union of India, has taken the step to declare this form of talaq unconstitutional and to
strike down its practice. 
In Triple Talaq: Examining Faith, Salman Khurshid, who intervened to offer the court an amicus brief in the Triple Talaq case"", offers a straightforward yet comprehensive
overview of this complicated issue. Explaining the reasons behind the court's decision, he dives deep into other aspects of
this practice: why it is wrong; why it has thrived; what was the judicial history of this issue; what the Quran and Muslim religious leaders say about it; and what the comparative practices in other countries are. A handy guide to this landmark decision and what it means for Muslims in India, this book is written not just for the
theologian, but also for the common reader.

The text has been honed over seven editions, displaying a fluency, authority, and insight rarely found in textbooks, which makes the process of assimilating information effective and enjoyable.
The book provides an introduction to all the clinical topics, subspecialties, and major psychiatric conditions required by the trainee psychiatrist. Throughout, the authors emphasize the basic clinical skills required for full assessment and understanding of the patient. Discussion of treatment includes not only scientific evidence, but also practical problems in the management of patients in a family and social context.
Full attention to ethical and legal issues is given within the evidence-based approach to practice provided in the text. Introductory chapters focus on recognition of signs and symptoms, classification and diagnosis, psychiatric assessment, and aetiology. Further chapters deal with all the major psychiatric syndromes, as well as providing detailed coverage of pharmacological and psychological treatments. The book gives equal prominence to ICD-10 and DSM-5 classifications, making the book relevant to the practice of psychiatry throughout the world-a perspective enhanced by the addition of a new chapter on global mental health.
Boasting greater use of summary boxes, tables, and lists within a new modern design, the Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry remains the most up-to-date secondary level textbook of psychiatry available. The extensive bibliography has been updated, and there are targeted reading lists for each chapter. The Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry fulfils all the study and revision needs of psychiatric trainees, but will also prove useful to medical students, general practitioners, qualified psychiatrists, and those in related fields who need to be kept informed with current psychiatric practice.",Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry,"Paul Harrison,Philip Cowen,Tom Burns,Mina Fazel", , ,Oxford University Press,9780198747437,"7th Edition,2018",884,India,English

Amartya Sen advances the theory that lack of democracy and famines are interrelated; he cites the example of the Bengal famine of 1943, stating that it only occurred because of the lack of democracy in India under British rule. He further argues that the situation was aggravated by the British government's suspension of trade in rice and grains among various Indian provinces.


Olivier Rubin's review of the evidence disagrees with Sen; after examining the cases of post-Independence India, Niger, and Malawi, he finds that ""democracy is no panacea against famine."" Rubin's analysis questions whether democracy and a free press were sufficient to truly avert famine in 1967 and 1972 (the Maharashtra famine involved some 130,000 deaths), and notes that some dynamics of electoral democracy complicate rather than bring about famine relief efforts. Rubin does not address colonial period famines.

On the other hand, Andrew Banik's study Starvation and India's democracy affirms Sen's thesis, but indicates that while democracy has been able to prevent famines in India, it has not been sufficient to avoid severe under-nutrition and starvation deaths, which Banik calls a 'silent emergency' in the country.

Practicing medicine is not an easy task. Besides the complexity of the subject and the diverse conditions and medicines that have to be studied. there is an additional factor in this profession that makes it daunting. The doctors are directly responsible for lives.

As the authors point out, the scraps of practical wisdom thrown out by senior doctors during the years of internship and residency can be lost quickly from memory. So, when a situation arises when a particular piece of advice would have served well, the doctor cannot recall it.

Oxford Handbook Of Clinical Medicine collects and presents all the wisdom gained by the authors over years of practical experience. Besides this, they discuss the theory and principles of medicine. They explain how the practice of medicine has evolved over the ages.

Starting from the time of Hippocrates, to the modern era, the book presents changing views. Packed with information on all aspects of clinical medicine, from taking down patient history to prescribing dosages, the book provides practical advice for the new practitioner. It begins with essential skills like recording patient history and examination, providing useful tips on how to get the maximum information from the patient.

Neatly arranged so that readers can easily locate the information they want, this eighth edition has been revised to bring it up-to-date. Color tabs at the sides facilitate instant access to the relevant sections when something needs to be looked up.

This book, Concise Inorganic Chemistry, begins by covering SI units and nomenclatures in the Periodic table. Then, the subject content of the book is divided into six parts. After the main coverage, there is an extensive appendix section, a total of 15 appendices.

The six main parts are Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, The S-Block Elements, The P-Block elements, The D-Block Elements, The F-Block Elements, and Other Topics.

The first part, Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, consists of chapters such as atomic structure and the periodic table, introduction to bonding, the ionic bond, the covalent bond, the metallic bond, general properties of the elements, coordination compounds, and hydrogen and the hydrides.
Part two, The S-Block Element, covers group 1 - the alkali metals, the chlor-alkali industry, and group 2 - the alkaline earth elements. Part three, The P-Block Element, covers the group 13 elements, the group 14 elements, the group 15 elements, group 16 - the chalcogens, group 17 - the halogens, and group 18 - the noble gases.

Part four, The D-Block Elements, covers an introduction to the transition elements, group 3 - the scandium group, group 4 - the the titanium group, group 5 - the vanadium group, group 6 - the chromium group, group 7 - the manganese group, group 8 - iron group, group 9 - the cobalt group, group 10 - the nickel group, group 11 - the copper group, coinage metals, and group 12 - the zinc group.

Part five, The F-Block Element, covers the lanthanide series, and the actinides. Part seven, Other Topics, consists of the atomic nucleus and spectra.

There are a total of 15 appendices. These are A: Abundance of the elements in the Earth’s crust, B: Melting points of the elements, C: Boiling points of the elements, D: Densities of the solid and liquid elements, and E: Electronic structures of the elements.

The next five are F: Some average single bond energies, and some double and triple bond energies, G: Solubility of main group compounds in water, H: Atomic weights based on 12C = 12000, I: Values of some fundamental physical constants, and J: Electrical resistivity of the elements at the stated temperature.

The last five appendices are K: Top fifty chemicals in the USA, 1994, L: Inorganic chemicals manufactured in large tonnages worldwide, M: Minerals used in large amounts, N: Hardness of minerals - Mohs’ scale, and O: Standard textbooks.

The presentation is interesting, it is never dull or drab. The author uses the correct blend of theory and application, tilting more towards the practical rather than theoretical. This book is a good reference material for college and university courses, and can be used as preparation material for entrance exams for postgraduate courses.

""... India is blessed with several world religions and therefore no single religious establishment can be the counterpart of the secular edifice. Therefore, instead of keeping religion out of politics, we sensibly give equal respect to each religion. However, the question, as to what is religion remains ... The Triple Talaq case offered the opportunity to consider the very idea of religion, but the Court thought it appropriate not to dive into a metaphysical or philosophical exercise, limiting its attention to what might be described as the layman's religion. Yet somehow, it seems that drawing distinctions between the core or essential part of religion and the peripheral aspect cannot be attempted without an understanding of the nature of religion."" 
Triple talaq, or talaq-e-bidat, is one of the most debated issues in the Muslim world. From antiquity, the Muslim faith
has been plagued by the portrayal of Muslim men regularly misusing this perceived ""right"" to divorce their wives instantly by simply uttering ""talaq” thrice. The Supreme Court of India, in the landmark judgment of Shayara Bano v. Union of India, has taken the step to declare this form of talaq unconstitutional and to
strike down its practice.

overview of this complicated issue. Explaining the reasons behind the court's decision, he dives deep into other aspects of
this practice: why it is wrong; why it has thrived; what was the judicial history of this issue; what the Quran and Muslim religious leaders say about it; and what the comparative practices in other countries are. A handy guide to this landmark decision and what it means for Muslims in India, this book is written not just for the
theologian, but also for the common reader.

The text has been honed over seven editions, displaying a fluency, authority, and insight rarely found in textbooks, which makes the process of assimilating information effective and enjoyable.
The book provides an introduction to all the clinical topics, subspecialties, and major psychiatric conditions required by the trainee psychiatrist. Throughout, the authors emphasize the basic clinical skills required for full assessment and understanding of the patient. Discussion of treatment includes not only scientific evidence, but also practical problems in the management of patients in a family and social context.
Full attention to ethical and legal issues is given within the evidence-based approach to practice provided in the text. Introductory chapters focus on recognition of signs and symptoms, classification and diagnosis, psychiatric assessment, and aetiology. Further chapters deal with all the major psychiatric syndromes, as well as providing detailed coverage of pharmacological and psychological treatments. The book gives equal prominence to ICD-10 and DSM-5 classifications, making the book relevant to the practice of psychiatry throughout the world-a perspective enhanced by the addition of a new chapter on global mental health.
Boasting greater use of summary boxes, tables, and lists within a new modern design, the Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry remains the most up-to-date secondary level textbook of psychiatry available. The extensive bibliography has been updated, and there are targeted reading lists for each chapter. The Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry fulfils all the study and revision needs of psychiatric trainees, but will also prove useful to medical students, general practitioners, qualified psychiatrists, and those in related fields who need to be kept informed with current psychiatric practice.",Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry,"Paul Harrison,Philip Cowen,Tom Burns,Mina Fazel", , ,Oxford University Press,9780198747437,"7th Edition,2018",884,India,English

Oxford Learner's Pocket Dictionary by OUP is a dictionary that has been compiled for people who need a trusty companion that is handy enough to carry around. It is termed as a pocket dictionary owing to its size but has a collection of 30000 words, idioms, and phrases. The explanations that accompany every word are accurate and leave no room for ambiguity.  Widely used dialects and phrases have been explained in the dictionary and an attempt has also been made to dispel the wrong interpretation of words. Oxford dictionaries are always updated with newly recognized words so that the vocabulary covered is extensive. The words have been spelt both in American and British English to help readers frame sentences in a geographically correct manner. Stress has also been laid on the proper pronunciation of all words. This dictionary has been designed in a very user friendly manner and is compact, so that it can be carried around easily.",Oxford Learner's Pocket Grammar,John Eastwood, , ,Oxford University Press,9780194336840,"Published,2008",396,India,English

Amartya Sen advances the theory that lack of democracy and famines are interrelated; he cites the example of the Bengal famine of 1943, stating that it only occurred because of the lack of democracy in India under British rule. He further argues that the situation was aggravated by the British government's suspension of trade in rice and grains among various Indian provinces.


Olivier Rubin's review of the evidence disagrees with Sen; after examining the cases of post-Independence India, Niger, and Malawi, he finds that ""democracy is no panacea against famine."" Rubin's analysis questions whether democracy and a free press were sufficient to truly avert famine in 1967 and 1972 (the Maharashtra famine involved some 130,000 deaths), and notes that some dynamics of electoral democracy complicate rather than bring about famine relief efforts. Rubin does not address colonial period famines.

On the other hand, Andrew Banik's study Starvation and India's democracy affirms Sen's thesis, but indicates that while democracy has been able to prevent famines in India, it has not been sufficient to avoid severe under-nutrition and starvation deaths, which Banik calls a 'silent emergency' in the country.

Practicing medicine is not an easy task. Besides the complexity of the subject and the diverse conditions and medicines that have to be studied. there is an additional factor in this profession that makes it daunting. The doctors are directly responsible for lives.

As the authors point out, the scraps of practical wisdom thrown out by senior doctors during the years of internship and residency can be lost quickly from memory. So, when a situation arises when a particular piece of advice would have served well, the doctor cannot recall it.

Oxford Handbook Of Clinical Medicine collects and presents all the wisdom gained by the authors over years of practical experience. Besides this, they discuss the theory and principles of medicine. They explain how the practice of medicine has evolved over the ages.

Starting from the time of Hippocrates, to the modern era, the book presents changing views. Packed with information on all aspects of clinical medicine, from taking down patient history to prescribing dosages, the book provides practical advice for the new practitioner. It begins with essential skills like recording patient history and examination, providing useful tips on how to get the maximum information from the patient.

Neatly arranged so that readers can easily locate the information they want, this eighth edition has been revised to bring it up-to-date. Color tabs at the sides facilitate instant access to the relevant sections when something needs to be looked up.

This book, Concise Inorganic Chemistry, begins by covering SI units and nomenclatures in the Periodic table. Then, the subject content of the book is divided into six parts. After the main coverage, there is an extensive appendix section, a total of 15 appendices.

The six main parts are Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, The S-Block Elements, The P-Block elements, The D-Block Elements, The F-Block Elements, and Other Topics.

The first part, Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, consists of chapters such as atomic structure and the periodic table, introduction to bonding, the ionic bond, the covalent bond, the metallic bond, general properties of the elements, coordination compounds, and hydrogen and the hydrides.
Part two, The S-Block Element, covers group 1 - the alkali metals, the chlor-alkali industry, and group 2 - the alkaline earth elements. Part three, The P-Block Element, covers the group 13 elements, the group 14 elements, the group 15 elements, group 16 - the chalcogens, group 17 - the halogens, and group 18 - the noble gases.

Part four, The D-Block Elements, covers an introduction to the transition elements, group 3 - the scandium group, group 4 - the the titanium group, group 5 - the vanadium group, group 6 - the chromium group, group 7 - the manganese group, group 8 - iron group, group 9 - the cobalt group, group 10 - the nickel group, group 11 - the copper group, coinage metals, and group 12 - the zinc group.

Part five, The F-Block Element, covers the lanthanide series, and the actinides. Part seven, Other Topics, consists of the atomic nucleus and spectra.

There are a total of 15 appendices. These are A: Abundance of the elements in the Earth’s crust, B: Melting points of the elements, C: Boiling points of the elements, D: Densities of the solid and liquid elements, and E: Electronic structures of the elements.

The next five are F: Some average single bond energies, and some double and triple bond energies, G: Solubility of main group compounds in water, H: Atomic weights based on 12C = 12000, I: Values of some fundamental physical constants, and J: Electrical resistivity of the elements at the stated temperature.

The last five appendices are K: Top fifty chemicals in the USA, 1994, L: Inorganic chemicals manufactured in large tonnages worldwide, M: Minerals used in large amounts, N: Hardness of minerals - Mohs’ scale, and O: Standard textbooks.

The presentation is interesting, it is never dull or drab. The author uses the correct blend of theory and application, tilting more towards the practical rather than theoretical. This book is a good reference material for college and university courses, and can be used as preparation material for entrance exams for postgraduate courses.

""... India is blessed with several world religions and therefore no single religious establishment can be the counterpart of the secular edifice. Therefore, instead of keeping religion out of politics, we sensibly give equal respect to each religion. However, the question, as to what is religion remains ... The Triple Talaq case offered the opportunity to consider the very idea of religion, but the Court thought it appropriate not to dive into a metaphysical or philosophical exercise, limiting its attention to what might be described as the layman's religion. Yet somehow, it seems that drawing distinctions between the core or essential part of religion and the peripheral aspect cannot be attempted without an understanding of the nature of religion."" 
Triple talaq, or talaq-e-bidat, is one of the most debated issues in the Muslim world. From antiquity, the Muslim faith
has been plagued by the portrayal of Muslim men regularly misusing this perceived ""right"" to divorce their wives instantly by simply uttering ""talaq” thrice. The Supreme Court of India, in the landmark judgment of Shayara Bano v. Union of India, has taken the step to declare this form of talaq unconstitutional and to
strike down its practice. 
In Triple Talaq: Examining Faith, Salman Khurshid, who intervened to offer the court an amicus brief in the Triple Talaq case"", offers a straightforward yet comprehensive
overview of this complicated issue. Explaining the reasons behind the court's decision, he dives deep into other aspects of
this practice: why it is wrong; why it has thrived; what was the judicial history of this issue; what the Quran and Muslim religious leaders say about it; and what the comparative practices in other countries are. A handy guide to this landmark decision and what it means for Muslims in India, this book is written not just for the
theologian, but also for the common reader.

The text has been honed over seven editions, displaying a fluency, authority, and insight rarely found in textbooks, which makes the process of assimilating information effective and enjoyable.
The book provides an introduction to all the clinical topics, subspecialties, and major psychiatric conditions required by the trainee psychiatrist. Throughout, the authors emphasize the basic clinical skills required for full assessment and understanding of the patient. Discussion of treatment includes not only scientific evidence, but also practical problems in the management of patients in a family and social context.
Full attention to ethical and legal issues is given within the evidence-based approach to practice provided in the text. Introductory chapters focus on recognition of signs and symptoms, classification and diagnosis, psychiatric assessment, and aetiology. Further chapters deal with all the major psychiatric syndromes, as well as providing detailed coverage of pharmacological and psychological treatments. The book gives equal prominence to ICD-10 and DSM-5 classifications, making the book relevant to the practice of psychiatry throughout the world-a perspective enhanced by the addition of a new chapter on global mental health.
Boasting greater use of summary boxes, tables, and lists within a new modern design, the Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry remains the most up-to-date secondary level textbook of psychiatry available. The extensive bibliography has been updated, and there are targeted reading lists for each chapter. The Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry fulfils all the study and revision needs of psychiatric trainees, but will also prove useful to medical students, general practitioners, qualified psychiatrists, and those in related fields who need to be kept informed with current psychiatric practice.",Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry,"Paul Harrison,Philip Cowen,Tom Burns,Mina Fazel", , ,Oxford University Press,9780198747437,"7th Edition,2018",884,India,English

Amartya Sen advances the theory that lack of democracy and famines are interrelated; he cites the example of the Bengal famine of 1943, stating that it only occurred because of the lack of democracy in India under British rule. He further argues that the situation was aggravated by the British government's suspension of trade in rice and grains among various Indian provinces.


Olivier Rubin's review of the evidence disagrees with Sen; after examining the cases of post-Independence India, Niger, and Malawi, he finds that ""democracy is no panacea against famine."" Rubin's analysis questions whether democracy and a free press were sufficient to truly avert famine in 1967 and 1972 (the Maharashtra famine involved some 130,000 deaths), and notes that some dynamics of electoral democracy complicate rather than bring about famine relief efforts. Rubin does not address colonial period famines.

On the other hand, Andrew Banik's study Starvation and India's democracy affirms Sen's thesis, but indicates that while democracy has been able to prevent famines in India, it has not been sufficient to avoid severe under-nutrition and starvation deaths, which Banik calls a 'silent emergency' in the country.

Practicing medicine is not an easy task. Besides the complexity of the subject and the diverse conditions and medicines that have to be studied. there is an additional factor in this profession that makes it daunting. The doctors are directly responsible for lives.

As the authors point out, the scraps of practical wisdom thrown out by senior doctors during the years of internship and residency can be lost quickly from memory. So, when a situation arises when a particular piece of advice would have served well, the doctor cannot recall it.

Oxford Handbook Of Clinical Medicine collects and presents all the wisdom gained by the authors over years of practical experience. Besides this, they discuss the theory and principles of medicine. They explain how the practice of medicine has evolved over the ages.

Starting from the time of Hippocrates, to the modern era, the book presents changing views. Packed with information on all aspects of clinical medicine, from taking down patient history to prescribing dosages, the book provides practical advice for the new practitioner. It begins with essential skills like recording patient history and examination, providing useful tips on how to get the maximum information from the patient.

Neatly arranged so that readers can easily locate the information they want, this eighth edition has been revised to bring it up-to-date. Color tabs at the sides facilitate instant access to the relevant sections when something needs to be looked up.

This book, Concise Inorganic Chemistry, begins by covering SI units and nomenclatures in the Periodic table. Then, the subject content of the book is divided into six parts. After the main coverage, there is an extensive appendix section, a total of 15 appendices.

The six main parts are Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, The S-Block Elements, The P-Block elements, The D-Block Elements, The F-Block Elements, and Other Topics.

The first part, Theoretical Concepts and Hydrogen, consists of chapters such as atomic structure and the periodic table, introduction to bonding, the ionic bond, the covalent bond, the metallic bond, general properties of the elements, coordination compounds, and hydrogen and the hydrides.
Part two, The S-Block Element, covers group 1 - the alkali metals, the chlor-alkali industry, and group 2 - the alkaline earth elements. Part three, The P-Block Element, covers the group 13 elements, the group 14 elements, the group 15 elements, group 16 - the chalcogens, group 17 - the halogens, and group 18 - the noble gases.

Part four, The D-Block Elements, covers an introduction to the transition elements, group 3 - the scandium group, group 4 - the the titanium group, group 5 - the vanadium group, group 6 - the chromium group, group 7 - the manganese group, group 8 - iron group, group 9 - the cobalt group, group 10 - the nickel group, group 11 - the copper group, coinage metals, and group 12 - the zinc group.

Part five, The F-Block Element, covers the lanthanide series, and the actinides. Part seven, Other Topics, consists of the atomic nucleus and spectra.

There are a total of 15 appendices. These are A: Abundance of the elements in the Earth’s crust, B: Melting points of the elements, C: Boiling points of the elements, D: Densities of the solid and liquid elements, and E: Electronic structures of the elements.

The next five are F: Some average single bond energies, and some double and triple bond energies, G: Solubility of main group compounds in water, H: Atomic weights based on 12C = 12000, I: Values of some fundamental physical constants, and J: Electrical resistivity of the elements at the stated temperature.

The last five appendices are K: Top fifty chemicals in the USA, 1994, L: Inorganic chemicals manufactured in large tonnages worldwide, M: Minerals used in large amounts, N: Hardness of minerals - Mohs’ scale, and O: Standard textbooks.

The presentation is interesting, it is never dull or drab. The author uses the correct blend of theory and application, tilting more towards the practical rather than theoretical. This book is a good reference material for college and university courses, and can be used as preparation material for entrance exams for postgraduate courses.

""... India is blessed with several world religions and therefore no single religious establishment can be the counterpart of the secular edifice. Therefore, instead of keeping religion out of politics, we sensibly give equal respect to each religion. However, the question, as to what is religion remains ... The Triple Talaq case offered the opportunity to consider the very idea of religion, but the Court thought it appropriate not to dive into a metaphysical or philosophical exercise, limiting its attention to what might be described as the layman's religion. Yet somehow, it seems that drawing distinctions between the core or essential part of religion and the peripheral aspect cannot be attempted without an understanding of the nature of religion."" 
Triple talaq, or talaq-e-bidat, is one of the most debated issues in the Muslim world. From antiquity, the Muslim faith
has been plagued by the portrayal of Muslim men regularly misusing this perceived ""right"" to divorce their wives instantly by simply uttering ""talaq” thrice. The Supreme Court of India, in the landmark judgment of Shayara Bano v. Union of India, has taken the step to declare this form of talaq unconstitutional and to
strike down its practice. 
In Triple Talaq: Examining Faith, Salman Khurshid, who intervened to offer the court an amicus brief in the Triple Talaq case"", offers a straightforward yet comprehensive
overview of this complicated issue. Explaining the reasons behind the court's decision, he dives deep into other aspects of
this practice: why it is wrong; why it has thrived; what was the judicial history of this issue; what the Quran and Muslim religious leaders say about it; and what the comparative practices in other countries are. A handy guide to this landmark decision and what it means for Muslims in India, this book is written not just for the
theologian, but also for the common reader.
