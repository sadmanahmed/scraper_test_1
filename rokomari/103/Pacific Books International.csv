Child Psychology,কিশোর কুন্দন দাওরা,"TK. 1,791","",https://rokomari.com//book/163427/child-psychology,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/231c85557_163427.jpg,"Child Psychology Child psychology is a broad area, covering how people change as they grow up from birth through to adolescence and trying to explain how these important changes occur - are 3-year-olds, 7-year-olds and teenagers different just because of their experiences of the world, or because of biological changes within the individual?
Because child psychology is so vast and tries to answer so many questions, researchers and practitioners often separate development into specific areas. Broadly, these tend to map onto children's physical, cognitive and social/emotional development. Child psychologists attempt to make sense of every aspect of child development, including how children learn, think, interact and respond emotionally to those around them, make friends, understand emotions and their own developing personalities, temperaments and skills.
In today's fast-life, children are subjected for emotional disorders, which are caused by several reasons. Conflicts of ideas or opinions, quarrel in the family, constant failures in achieving the goal, severe anxiety or worry, deep sense of sadness due to loss of livelihood, strong feeling of destitute, a feeling that he/she became an orphan, behaviour disorders. Child psychology studies systematically about these disorders and offers appropriate solutions.
This book will be highly useful to scholars, academics, educationalists and psychologists.",Child Psychology,Kishore Kundan Dawrah, , ,Pacific Books International,9789386655639,"1st Edition,2018",272,India,English

Because child psychology is so vast and tries to answer so many questions, researchers and practitioners often separate development into specific areas. Broadly, these tend to map onto children's physical, cognitive and social/emotional development. Child psychologists attempt to make sense of every aspect of child development, including how children learn, think, interact and respond emotionally to those around them, make friends, understand emotions and their own developing personalities, temperaments and skills.
In today's fast-life, children are subjected for emotional disorders, which are caused by several reasons. Conflicts of ideas or opinions, quarrel in the family, constant failures in achieving the goal, severe anxiety or worry, deep sense of sadness due to loss of livelihood, strong feeling of destitute, a feeling that he/she became an orphan, behaviour disorders. Child psychology studies systematically about these disorders and offers appropriate solutions.
This book will be highly useful to scholars, academics, educationalists and psychologists.",Child Psychology,Kishore Kundan Dawrah, , ,Pacific Books International,9789386655639,"1st Edition,2018",272,India,English

Because child psychology is so vast and tries to answer so many questions, researchers and practitioners often separate development into specific areas. Broadly, these tend to map onto children's physical, cognitive and social/emotional development. Child psychologists attempt to make sense of every aspect of child development, including how children learn, think, interact and respond emotionally to those around them, make friends, understand emotions and their own developing personalities, temperaments and skills.
In today's fast-life, children are subjected for emotional disorders, which are caused by several reasons. Conflicts of ideas or opinions, quarrel in the family, constant failures in achieving the goal, severe anxiety or worry, deep sense of sadness due to loss of livelihood, strong feeling of destitute, a feeling that he/she became an orphan, behaviour disorders. Child psychology studies systematically about these disorders and offers appropriate solutions.
This book will be highly useful to scholars, academics, educationalists and psychologists.",Child Psychology,Kishore Kundan Dawrah, , ,Pacific Books International,9789386655639,"1st Edition,2018",272,India,English

Because child psychology is so vast and tries to answer so many questions, researchers and practitioners often separate development into specific areas. Broadly, these tend to map onto children's physical, cognitive and social/emotional development. Child psychologists attempt to make sense of every aspect of child development, including how children learn, think, interact and respond emotionally to those around them, make friends, understand emotions and their own developing personalities, temperaments and skills.
In today's fast-life, children are subjected for emotional disorders, which are caused by several reasons. Conflicts of ideas or opinions, quarrel in the family, constant failures in achieving the goal, severe anxiety or worry, deep sense of sadness due to loss of livelihood, strong feeling of destitute, a feeling that he/she became an orphan, behaviour disorders. Child psychology studies systematically about these disorders and offers appropriate solutions.
This book will be highly useful to scholars, academics, educationalists and psychologists.",Child Psychology,Kishore Kundan Dawrah, , ,Pacific Books International,9789386655639,"1st Edition,2018",272,India,English

Because child psychology is so vast and tries to answer so many questions, researchers and practitioners often separate development into specific areas. Broadly, these tend to map onto children's physical, cognitive and social/emotional development. Child psychologists attempt to make sense of every aspect of child development, including how children learn, think, interact and respond emotionally to those around them, make friends, understand emotions and their own developing personalities, temperaments and skills.
In today's fast-life, children are subjected for emotional disorders, which are caused by several reasons. Conflicts of ideas or opinions, quarrel in the family, constant failures in achieving the goal, severe anxiety or worry, deep sense of sadness due to loss of livelihood, strong feeling of destitute, a feeling that he/she became an orphan, behaviour disorders. Child psychology studies systematically about these disorders and offers appropriate solutions.
This book will be highly useful to scholars, academics, educationalists and psychologists.",Child Psychology,Kishore Kundan Dawrah, , ,Pacific Books International,9789386655639,"1st Edition,2018",272,India,English

Because child psychology is so vast and tries to answer so many questions, researchers and practitioners often separate development into specific areas. Broadly, these tend to map onto children's physical, cognitive and social/emotional development. Child psychologists attempt to make sense of every aspect of child development, including how children learn, think, interact and respond emotionally to those around them, make friends, understand emotions and their own developing personalities, temperaments and skills.
In today's fast-life, children are subjected for emotional disorders, which are caused by several reasons. Conflicts of ideas or opinions, quarrel in the family, constant failures in achieving the goal, severe anxiety or worry, deep sense of sadness due to loss of livelihood, strong feeling of destitute, a feeling that he/she became an orphan, behaviour disorders. Child psychology studies systematically about these disorders and offers appropriate solutions.
This book will be highly useful to scholars, academics, educationalists and psychologists.",Child Psychology,Kishore Kundan Dawrah, , ,Pacific Books International,9789386655639,"1st Edition,2018",272,India,English

Because child psychology is so vast and tries to answer so many questions, researchers and practitioners often separate development into specific areas. Broadly, these tend to map onto children's physical, cognitive and social/emotional development. Child psychologists attempt to make sense of every aspect of child development, including how children learn, think, interact and respond emotionally to those around them, make friends, understand emotions and their own developing personalities, temperaments and skills.
In today's fast-life, children are subjected for emotional disorders, which are caused by several reasons. Conflicts of ideas or opinions, quarrel in the family, constant failures in achieving the goal, severe anxiety or worry, deep sense of sadness due to loss of livelihood, strong feeling of destitute, a feeling that he/she became an orphan, behaviour disorders. Child psychology studies systematically about these disorders and offers appropriate solutions.
This book will be highly useful to scholars, academics, educationalists and psychologists.",Child Psychology,Kishore Kundan Dawrah, , ,Pacific Books International,9789386655639,"1st Edition,2018",272,India,English
