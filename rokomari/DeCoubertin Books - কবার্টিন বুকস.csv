‘A deep story and significant one.’ *Alison Mitchell, Stumped*
 
'A gutsy individual; always confident, always smart. I have nothing but admiration for Tatenda, who kept giving to the game and continually tried to do the right thing.' *Andy Flower*
 
At the start of April 2004, Tatenda Taibu was announced as captain of the Zimbabwe cricket team after the resignation of Heath Streak. Aged just twenty, he had become the youngest Test skipper in history and the first black player to captain Zimbabwe in the sport. Just over a year later he was exiled in Bangladesh, on the run from a cricket board that tried to threaten him into silence. Keeper of Faith is his story. 
From his upbringing in the township of Highfield, Harare, to his early days as a cricketing prodigy, to quitting the sport at the age of 29 to devote more time to his Christian faith, this autobiography reflects on what it is like to be an outspoken athlete in Zimbabwe during the regime of Robert Mugabe.
Much of Taibu’s career took place against a backdrop of constant mismanagement, poor administration and regular political interference, and he provides first-hand accounts of the damaging effect this had on Zimbabwe cricket, from Andy Flower and Henry Olonga’s ‘death of democracy’ protest at the 2003 World Cup to his own stand in 2005, which compromised the safety of him and his young family.
The fame that the sport brought him also caused him to question his purpose in life and Taibu reflects on the rediscovery of his faith, which helped him to put cricket – and his life – into a better perspective.
 
Coming full circle, Taibu witnessed more recent developments in Zimbabwean cricket as a selector and academy director only to leave once more in acrimonious circumstances – which makes him perfectly placed to offer his views on the way forward for sport in his country after an era of turmoil.","Keeper of Faith: Cricket,Conflict and God in Zimbabwe's Age of Extremes",Tatenda Taibu, , ,DeCoubertin Books,9781909245860,"1st Edition,2019",246,India,English
