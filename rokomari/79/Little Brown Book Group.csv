A man with a faded, well-worn notebook open in his lap. A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. An achingly tender story about the enduring power of love.

A man with a faded, well-worn notebook open in his lap. A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. The Notebook is an achingly tender story about the enduring power of love, a story of miracles that will stay with you forever. 

Set amid the austere beauty of coastal North Carolina in 1946, The Notebook begins with the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner returned home from World War II. Noah, thirty-one, is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories...until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again. 

Allie Nelson, twenty-nine, is now engaged to another man, but realizes that the original passion she felt for Noah has not dimmed with the passage of time. Still, the obstacles that once ended their previous relationship remain, and the gulf between their worlds is too vast to ignore. With her impending marriage only weeks away, Allie is forced to confront her hopes and dreams for the future, a future that only she can shape. 

Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just the beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes. The result is a deeply moving portrait of love itself, the tender moments and the fundamental changes that affect us all. Shining with a beauty that is rarely found in current literature, The Notebook establishes Nicholas Sparks as a classic storyteller with a unique insight into the only emotion that really matters. 

""I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough.""",The Notebook,Nicholas Sparks, , ,Little Brown Book Group,9780751538915,"New edition,2007",240,India,English

The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference is the debut book by Malcolm Gladwell, first published by Little, Brown in 2000. Gladwell defines a tipping point as ""the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point"". The book seeks to explain and describe the ""mysterious"" sociological changes that mark everyday life. As Gladwell states: ""Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread like viruses do"". The examples of such changes in his book include the rise in popularity and sales of Hush Puppies shoes in the mid-1990s and the steep drop in New York City's crime rate after 1990.

Travis Parker has everything a man could want: a good job, loyal friends, even a waterfront home in small-town North Carolina. In full pursuit of the good life—boating, swimming, and regular barbecues with his good-natured buddies—he holds the vague conviction that a serious relationship with a woman would only cramp his style. That is, until Gabby Holland moves in next door. Despite his attempts to be neighborly, the appealing redhead seems to have a chip on her shoulder about him…and the presence of her longtime boyfriend doesn’t help. Despite himself, Travis can’t stop trying to ingratiate himself with his new neighbor, and his persistent efforts lead them both to the doorstep of a journey that neither could have foreseen. Spanning the eventful years of young love, marriage and family, The Choice ultimately confronts us with the most heart wrenching question of all: how far would you go to keep the hope of love alive?",The Choice,Nicholas Sparks, , ,Little Brown Book Group,9780751539257,"1st Edition,2011",336,India,English

In a store with the miraculous effluence of books all around, their words prancing from page to page and seducing readers and book lovers to read them, waits an irascible old man who refuses to believe there is hope in a world which doesn't read any longer. His wife has died, and his book store barely sells anything any longer. His prized collection, a rare collection of poems by Edgar Allan Poe, has been stolen. It feels like A. J. Fikry finds bad luck wherever he turns. He retreats from the other people at Alice Island, and isolates himself mentally. Lambiase, the policeman who has always felt sympathetic towards Fikry doesn't know why. Ismay, Fikry's sister-in-law, only wishes to save him from his dreary self, and Amelia, a pretty, idealistic and a little eccentric Knightley Press sales representative rides the ferry constantly to come to Alice Island just for A. J., despite his bad attitude. His books themselves seem dreary to him, and the world has lost the scent of old books, and the promise of an old favourite seems a lie. When a mysterious package arrives at A. J.'s doorstep, he begins to see life anew and smell the pages once again. Sold as the Storied Life of A. J. Fikry, this book returns readers to a simple time, when all that a plot needs to keep a reader reading is the good hearted promise of fulfilled wishes, a cup of coffee steaming by the window-sill, and the sound of a paper freshly turned, never read before, holding all the wonder and seduction of an unread book.

A man with a faded, well-worn notebook open in his lap. A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. An achingly tender story about the enduring power of love.

A man with a faded, well-worn notebook open in his lap. A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. The Notebook is an achingly tender story about the enduring power of love, a story of miracles that will stay with you forever. 

Set amid the austere beauty of coastal North Carolina in 1946, The Notebook begins with the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner returned home from World War II. Noah, thirty-one, is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories...until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again. 

Allie Nelson, twenty-nine, is now engaged to another man, but realizes that the original passion she felt for Noah has not dimmed with the passage of time. Still, the obstacles that once ended their previous relationship remain, and the gulf between their worlds is too vast to ignore. With her impending marriage only weeks away, Allie is forced to confront her hopes and dreams for the future, a future that only she can shape. 

Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just the beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes. The result is a deeply moving portrait of love itself, the tender moments and the fundamental changes that affect us all. Shining with a beauty that is rarely found in current literature, The Notebook establishes Nicholas Sparks as a classic storyteller with a unique insight into the only emotion that really matters. 

""I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough.""",The Notebook,Nicholas Sparks, , ,Little Brown Book Group,9780751538915,"New edition,2007",240,India,English

The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference is the debut book by Malcolm Gladwell, first published by Little, Brown in 2000. Gladwell defines a tipping point as ""the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point"". The book seeks to explain and describe the ""mysterious"" sociological changes that mark everyday life. As Gladwell states: ""Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread like viruses do"". The examples of such changes in his book include the rise in popularity and sales of Hush Puppies shoes in the mid-1990s and the steep drop in New York City's crime rate after 1990.

Travis Parker has everything a man could want: a good job, loyal friends, even a waterfront home in small-town North Carolina. In full pursuit of the good life—boating, swimming, and regular barbecues with his good-natured buddies—he holds the vague conviction that a serious relationship with a woman would only cramp his style. That is, until Gabby Holland moves in next door. Despite his attempts to be neighborly, the appealing redhead seems to have a chip on her shoulder about him…and the presence of her longtime boyfriend doesn’t help. Despite himself, Travis can’t stop trying to ingratiate himself with his new neighbor, and his persistent efforts lead them both to the doorstep of a journey that neither could have foreseen.

In a store with the miraculous effluence of books all around, their words prancing from page to page and seducing readers and book lovers to read them, waits an irascible old man who refuses to believe there is hope in a world which doesn't read any longer. His wife has died, and his book store barely sells anything any longer. His prized collection, a rare collection of poems by Edgar Allan Poe, has been stolen. It feels like A. J. Fikry finds bad luck wherever he turns. He retreats from the other people at Alice Island, and isolates himself mentally. Lambiase, the policeman who has always felt sympathetic towards Fikry doesn't know why. Ismay, Fikry's sister-in-law, only wishes to save him from his dreary self, and Amelia, a pretty, idealistic and a little eccentric Knightley Press sales representative rides the ferry constantly to come to Alice Island just for A. J., despite his bad attitude. His books themselves seem dreary to him, and the world has lost the scent of old books, and the promise of an old favourite seems a lie. When a mysterious package arrives at A. J.'s doorstep, he begins to see life anew and smell the pages once again. Sold as the Storied Life of A. J. Fikry, this book returns readers to a simple time, when all that a plot needs to keep a reader reading is the good hearted promise of fulfilled wishes, a cup of coffee steaming by the window-sill, and the sound of a paper freshly turned, never read before, holding all the wonder and seduction of an unread book.

A man with a faded, well-worn notebook open in his lap. A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. An achingly tender story about the enduring power of love.

A man with a faded, well-worn notebook open in his lap. A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. The Notebook is an achingly tender story about the enduring power of love, a story of miracles that will stay with you forever. 

Set amid the austere beauty of coastal North Carolina in 1946, The Notebook begins with the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner returned home from World War II. Noah, thirty-one, is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories...until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again. 

Allie Nelson, twenty-nine, is now engaged to another man, but realizes that the original passion she felt for Noah has not dimmed with the passage of time. Still, the obstacles that once ended their previous relationship remain, and the gulf between their worlds is too vast to ignore. With her impending marriage only weeks away, Allie is forced to confront her hopes and dreams for the future, a future that only she can shape. 

Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just the beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes. The result is a deeply moving portrait of love itself, the tender moments and the fundamental changes that affect us all. Shining with a beauty that is rarely found in current literature, The Notebook establishes Nicholas Sparks as a classic storyteller with a unique insight into the only emotion that really matters. 

""I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough.""",The Notebook,Nicholas Sparks, , ,Little Brown Book Group,9780751538915,"New edition,2007",240,India,English

The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference is the debut book by Malcolm Gladwell, first published by Little, Brown in 2000. Gladwell defines a tipping point as ""the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point"". The book seeks to explain and describe the ""mysterious"" sociological changes that mark everyday life. As Gladwell states: ""Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread like viruses do"". The examples of such changes in his book include the rise in popularity and sales of Hush Puppies shoes in the mid-1990s and the steep drop in New York City's crime rate after 1990.

Travis Parker has everything a man could want: a good job, loyal friends, even a waterfront home in small-town North Carolina. In full pursuit of the good life—boating, swimming, and regular barbecues with his good-natured buddies—he holds the vague conviction that a serious relationship with a woman would only cramp his style. That is, until Gabby Holland moves in next door. Despite his attempts to be neighborly, the appealing redhead seems to have a chip on her shoulder about him…and the presence of her longtime boyfriend doesn’t help. Despite himself, Travis can’t stop trying to ingratiate himself with his new neighbor, and his persistent efforts lead them both to the doorstep of a journey that neither could have foreseen. Spanning the eventful years of young love, marriage and family, The Choice ultimately confronts us with the most heart wrenching question of all: how far would you go to keep the hope of love alive?",The Choice,Nicholas Sparks, , ,Little Brown Book Group,9780751539257,"1st Edition,2011",336,India,English

Just ask Zoey Redbird - she's become an expert on suckiness. In one week she has gone from having three boyfriends to having none, and from having a close group of friends who trusted and supported her, to being an outcast.

In a store with the miraculous effluence of books all around, their words prancing from page to page and seducing readers and book lovers to read them, waits an irascible old man who refuses to believe there is hope in a world which doesn't read any longer. His wife has died, and his book store barely sells anything any longer. His prized collection, a rare collection of poems by Edgar Allan Poe, has been stolen. It feels like A. J. Fikry finds bad luck wherever he turns. He retreats from the other people at Alice Island, and isolates himself mentally. Lambiase, the policeman who has always felt sympathetic towards Fikry doesn't know why. Ismay, Fikry's sister-in-law, only wishes to save him from his dreary self, and Amelia, a pretty, idealistic and a little eccentric Knightley Press sales representative rides the ferry constantly to come to Alice Island just for A. J., despite his bad attitude. His books themselves seem dreary to him, and the world has lost the scent of old books, and the promise of an old favourite seems a lie. When a mysterious package arrives at A. J.'s doorstep, he begins to see life anew and smell the pages once again. Sold as the Storied Life of A. J. Fikry, this book returns readers to a simple time, when all that a plot needs to keep a reader reading is the good hearted promise of fulfilled wishes, a cup of coffee steaming by the window-sill, and the sound of a paper freshly turned, never read before, holding all the wonder and seduction of an unread book.

A man with a faded, well-worn notebook open in his lap. A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. An achingly tender story about the enduring power of love.

A man with a faded, well-worn notebook open in his lap. A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. The Notebook is an achingly tender story about the enduring power of love, a story of miracles that will stay with you forever. 

Set amid the austere beauty of coastal North Carolina in 1946, The Notebook begins with the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner returned home from World War II. Noah, thirty-one, is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories...until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again. 

Allie Nelson, twenty-nine, is now engaged to another man, but realizes that the original passion she felt for Noah has not dimmed with the passage of time. Still, the obstacles that once ended their previous relationship remain, and the gulf between their worlds is too vast to ignore. With her impending marriage only weeks away, Allie is forced to confront her hopes and dreams for the future, a future that only she can shape. 

Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just the beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes. The result is a deeply moving portrait of love itself, the tender moments and the fundamental changes that affect us all. Shining with a beauty that is rarely found in current literature, The Notebook establishes Nicholas Sparks as a classic storyteller with a unique insight into the only emotion that really matters. 

""I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough.""",The Notebook,Nicholas Sparks, , ,Little Brown Book Group,9780751538915,"New edition,2007",240,India,English

The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference is the debut book by Malcolm Gladwell, first published by Little, Brown in 2000. Gladwell defines a tipping point as ""the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point"". The book seeks to explain and describe the ""mysterious"" sociological changes that mark everyday life. As Gladwell states: ""Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread like viruses do"". The examples of such changes in his book include the rise in popularity and sales of Hush Puppies shoes in the mid-1990s and the steep drop in New York City's crime rate after 1990.

Travis Parker has everything a man could want: a good job, loyal friends, even a waterfront home in small-town North Carolina. In full pursuit of the good life—boating, swimming, and regular barbecues with his good-natured buddies—he holds the vague conviction that a serious relationship with a woman would only cramp his style. That is, until Gabby Holland moves in next door. Despite his attempts to be neighborly, the appealing redhead seems to have a chip on her shoulder about him…and the presence of her longtime boyfriend doesn’t help. Despite himself, Travis can’t stop trying to ingratiate himself with his new neighbor, and his persistent efforts lead them both to the doorstep of a journey that neither could have foreseen. Spanning the eventful years of young love, marriage and family, The Choice ultimately confronts us with the most heart wrenching question of all: how far would you go to keep the hope of love alive?",The Choice,Nicholas Sparks, , ,Little Brown Book Group,9780751539257,"1st Edition,2011",336,India,English

In a store with the miraculous effluence of books all around, their words prancing from page to page and seducing readers and book lovers to read them, waits an irascible old man who refuses to believe there is hope in a world which doesn't read any longer. His wife has died, and his book store barely sells anything any longer. His prized collection, a rare collection of poems by Edgar Allan Poe, has been stolen. It feels like A. J. Fikry finds bad luck wherever he turns. He retreats from the other people at Alice Island, and isolates himself mentally. Lambiase, the policeman who has always felt sympathetic towards Fikry doesn't know why. Ismay, Fikry's sister-in-law, only wishes to save him from his dreary self, and Amelia, a pretty, idealistic and a little eccentric Knightley Press sales representative rides the ferry constantly to come to Alice Island just for A. J., despite his bad attitude. His books themselves seem dreary to him, and the world has lost the scent of old books, and the promise of an old favourite seems a lie. When a mysterious package arrives at A. J.'s doorstep, he begins to see life anew and smell the pages once again. Sold as the Storied Life of A. J. Fikry, this book returns readers to a simple time, when all that a plot needs to keep a reader reading is the good hearted promise of fulfilled wishes, a cup of coffee steaming by the window-sill, and the sound of a paper freshly turned, never read before, holding all the wonder and seduction of an unread book.
