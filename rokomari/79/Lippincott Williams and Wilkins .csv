It stood as the last great single author reference text in medicine, a combination of meticulous, exhaustive research conveyed in a beautifully clear style. Now the mantle has been passed to a group of five distinguished authors and it is to their considerable credit that the attributes which made Organic Psychiatry such a distinctive voice remain. The fourth Edition of Lishman’s Organic Psychiatry is a rich blend of detailed clinical inquiry and up to date neuroscience. It should be on every psychiatrist’s book shelf.” - Anthony Feinstein MPhil, PhD., FRCP, Professor, Department of Psychiatry,  University of Toronto, Canada

Over the past 30 years, thousands of physicians have depended on Lishman’s Organic Psychiatry. Its authoritative and reliable clinical guidance was - and still is - beyond compare.

The new edition of this classic textbook has now been extensively revised by a team of five authors, yet it follows the tradition of the original single-authored book. It continues to provide a comprehensive review of the cognitive, emotional and behavioural consequences of cerebral disorders and their manifestations in clinical practice. Enabling clinicians to formulate incisive diagnoses and appropriate treatment strategies, Lishman's Organic Psychiatry is an invaluable source of information for practising psychiatrists, neurologists and trainees.

This new edition:

    covers recent theoretical and clinical developments, with expanded sections on neuropsychology and neuroimaging
    includes a new chapter on sleep disorders whilst the chapters on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, Epilepsy, Movement disorders and Traumatic brain injury have been extensively revised reflecting the greatly improved understanding of their  underlying pathophysiologies

It stood as the last great single author reference text in medicine, a combination of meticulous, exhaustive research conveyed in a beautifully clear style. Now the mantle has been passed to a group of five distinguished authors and it is to their considerable credit that the attributes which made Organic Psychiatry such a distinctive voice remain. The fourth Edition of Lishman’s Organic Psychiatry is a rich blend of detailed clinical inquiry and up to date neuroscience. It should be on every psychiatrist’s book shelf.” - Anthony Feinstein MPhil, PhD., FRCP, Professor, Department of Psychiatry,  University of Toronto, Canada

Over the past 30 years, thousands of physicians have depended on Lishman’s Organic Psychiatry. Its authoritative and reliable clinical guidance was - and still is - beyond compare.

The new edition of this classic textbook has now been extensively revised by a team of five authors, yet it follows the tradition of the original single-authored book. It continues to provide a comprehensive review of the cognitive, emotional and behavioural consequences of cerebral disorders and their manifestations in clinical practice. Enabling clinicians to formulate incisive diagnoses and appropriate treatment strategies, Lishman's Organic Psychiatry is an invaluable source of information for practising psychiatrists, neurologists and trainees.

It stood as the last great single author reference text in medicine, a combination of meticulous, exhaustive research conveyed in a beautifully clear style. Now the mantle has been passed to a group of five distinguished authors and it is to their considerable credit that the attributes which made Organic Psychiatry such a distinctive voice remain. The fourth Edition of Lishman’s Organic Psychiatry is a rich blend of detailed clinical inquiry and up to date neuroscience. It should be on every psychiatrist’s book shelf.” - Anthony Feinstein MPhil, PhD., FRCP, Professor, Department of Psychiatry,  University of Toronto, Canada

Over the past 30 years, thousands of physicians have depended on Lishman’s Organic Psychiatry. Its authoritative and reliable clinical guidance was - and still is - beyond compare.

The new edition of this classic textbook has now been extensively revised by a team of five authors, yet it follows the tradition of the original single-authored book. It continues to provide a comprehensive review of the cognitive, emotional and behavioural consequences of cerebral disorders and their manifestations in clinical practice. Enabling clinicians to formulate incisive diagnoses and appropriate treatment strategies, Lishman's Organic Psychiatry is an invaluable source of information for practising psychiatrists, neurologists and trainees.

This new edition:

    covers recent theoretical and clinical developments, with expanded sections on neuropsychology and neuroimaging
    includes a new chapter on sleep disorders whilst the chapters on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, Epilepsy, Movement disorders and Traumatic brain injury have been extensively revised reflecting the greatly improved understanding of their  underlying pathophysiologies
    showcases the huge advances in brain imaging and important discoveries in the fields of molecular biology and molecular genetics

It stood as the last great single author reference text in medicine, a combination of meticulous, exhaustive research conveyed in a beautifully clear style. Now the mantle has been passed to a group of five distinguished authors and it is to their considerable credit that the attributes which made Organic Psychiatry such a distinctive voice remain. The fourth Edition of Lishman’s Organic Psychiatry is a rich blend of detailed clinical inquiry and up to date neuroscience. It should be on every psychiatrist’s book shelf.” - Anthony Feinstein MPhil, PhD., FRCP, Professor, Department of Psychiatry,  University of Toronto, Canada

Over the past 30 years, thousands of physicians have depended on Lishman’s Organic Psychiatry. Its authoritative and reliable clinical guidance was - and still is - beyond compare.

The new edition of this classic textbook has now been extensively revised by a team of five authors, yet it follows the tradition of the original single-authored book. It continues to provide a comprehensive review of the cognitive, emotional and behavioural consequences of cerebral disorders and their manifestations in clinical practice. Enabling clinicians to formulate incisive diagnoses and appropriate treatment strategies, Lishman's Organic Psychiatry is an invaluable source of information for practising psychiatrists, neurologists and trainees.

This new edition:

    covers recent theoretical and clinical developments, with expanded sections on neuropsychology and neuroimaging
    includes a new chapter on sleep disorders whilst the chapters on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, Epilepsy, Movement disorders and Traumatic brain injury have been extensively revised reflecting the greatly improved understanding of their  underlying pathophysiologies

It stood as the last great single author reference text in medicine, a combination of meticulous, exhaustive research conveyed in a beautifully clear style. Now the mantle has been passed to a group of five distinguished authors and it is to their considerable credit that the attributes which made Organic Psychiatry such a distinctive voice remain. The fourth Edition of Lishman’s Organic Psychiatry is a rich blend of detailed clinical inquiry and up to date neuroscience. It should be on every psychiatrist’s book shelf.” - Anthony Feinstein MPhil, PhD., FRCP, Professor, Department of Psychiatry,  University of Toronto, Canada

Over the past 30 years, thousands of physicians have depended on Lishman’s Organic Psychiatry. Its authoritative and reliable clinical guidance was - and still is - beyond compare.

The new edition of this classic textbook has now been extensively revised by a team of five authors, yet it follows the tradition of the original single-authored book. It continues to provide a comprehensive review of the cognitive, emotional and behavioural consequences of cerebral disorders and their manifestations in clinical practice. Enabling clinicians to formulate incisive diagnoses and appropriate treatment strategies, Lishman's Organic Psychiatry is an invaluable source of information for practising psychiatrists, neurologists and trainees.

It stood as the last great single author reference text in medicine, a combination of meticulous, exhaustive research conveyed in a beautifully clear style. Now the mantle has been passed to a group of five distinguished authors and it is to their considerable credit that the attributes which made Organic Psychiatry such a distinctive voice remain. The fourth Edition of Lishman’s Organic Psychiatry is a rich blend of detailed clinical inquiry and up to date neuroscience. It should be on every psychiatrist’s book shelf.” - Anthony Feinstein MPhil, PhD., FRCP, Professor, Department of Psychiatry,  University of Toronto, Canada

Over the past 30 years, thousands of physicians have depended on Lishman’s Organic Psychiatry. Its authoritative and reliable clinical guidance was - and still is - beyond compare.

The new edition of this classic textbook has now been extensively revised by a team of five authors, yet it follows the tradition of the original single-authored book. It continues to provide a comprehensive review of the cognitive, emotional and behavioural consequences of cerebral disorders and their manifestations in clinical practice. Enabling clinicians to formulate incisive diagnoses and appropriate treatment strategies, Lishman's Organic Psychiatry is an invaluable source of information for practising psychiatrists, neurologists and trainees.

This new edition:

    covers recent theoretical and clinical developments, with expanded sections on neuropsychology and neuroimaging
    includes a new chapter on sleep disorders whilst the chapters on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, Epilepsy, Movement disorders and Traumatic brain injury have been extensively revised reflecting the greatly improved understanding of their  underlying pathophysiologies
    showcases the huge advances in brain imaging and important discoveries in the fields of molecular biology and molecular genetics
    has been enhanced with the inclusion of more tables and illustrations to aid clinical assessment
    incorporates important diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance brain images.",Lishman'S Organic Psychiatry,Anthony David, , ,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins ,9781405118606,"4th Edition,2009",933,India,English

It stood as the last great single author reference text in medicine, a combination of meticulous, exhaustive research conveyed in a beautifully clear style. Now the mantle has been passed to a group of five distinguished authors and it is to their considerable credit that the attributes which made Organic Psychiatry such a distinctive voice remain. The fourth Edition of Lishman’s Organic Psychiatry is a rich blend of detailed clinical inquiry and up to date neuroscience. It should be on every psychiatrist’s book shelf.” - Anthony Feinstein MPhil, PhD., FRCP, Professor, Department of Psychiatry,  University of Toronto, Canada

Over the past 30 years, thousands of physicians have depended on Lishman’s Organic Psychiatry. Its authoritative and reliable clinical guidance was - and still is - beyond compare.

The new edition of this classic textbook has now been extensively revised by a team of five authors, yet it follows the tradition of the original single-authored book. It continues to provide a comprehensive review of the cognitive, emotional and behavioural consequences of cerebral disorders and their manifestations in clinical practice. Enabling clinicians to formulate incisive diagnoses and appropriate treatment strategies, Lishman's Organic Psychiatry is an invaluable source of information for practising psychiatrists, neurologists and trainees.

It stood as the last great single author reference text in medicine, a combination of meticulous, exhaustive research conveyed in a beautifully clear style. Now the mantle has been passed to a group of five distinguished authors and it is to their considerable credit that the attributes which made Organic Psychiatry such a distinctive voice remain. The fourth Edition of Lishman’s Organic Psychiatry is a rich blend of detailed clinical inquiry and up to date neuroscience. It should be on every psychiatrist’s book shelf.” - Anthony Feinstein MPhil, PhD., FRCP, Professor, Department of Psychiatry,  University of Toronto, Canada

Over the past 30 years, thousands of physicians have depended on Lishman’s Organic Psychiatry. Its authoritative and reliable clinical guidance was - and still is - beyond compare.

The new edition of this classic textbook has now been extensively revised by a team of five authors, yet it follows the tradition of the original single-authored book. It continues to provide a comprehensive review of the cognitive, emotional and behavioural consequences of cerebral disorders and their manifestations in clinical practice. Enabling clinicians to formulate incisive diagnoses and appropriate treatment strategies, Lishman's Organic Psychiatry is an invaluable source of information for practising psychiatrists, neurologists and trainees.
