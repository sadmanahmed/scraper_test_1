It addresses to the surface and ground water resources and their characteristics, in general and inherent in the coastal water environment, and describes the coastal environment with ecological divisions and coastal regulation Zones. Water resource use is highlighted mainly in coastal fisheries and aquaculture, and also in multiple uses for agriculture, forestry and waste disposal. Impacts of resource use on the coastal environment with potential and specific cases have been discussed. The book focuses on water quality aspects with the basic management issues such as physico-chemical, biophysical and biological parmeters and their interactions on the dynamics of the systems in a water body. On water quality management included are the topics under pond water treatment for control and management of aquatic environment for culture practices, and on farm effluent treatment for reduction of environmental impact in the surrounding water bodies. Related numerical problems have been given as examples in most of the chapters, as well as few sample questions for students’ work.

Rather than presenting its material in a simple geographical framework, the book uses ocean dynamics as a frame of reference. Students of marine biology, chemistry, geology and engineering therefore find it useful as an introduction to basic ocean dynamics. The presentation of the regional distribution of properties is based on the modern data bases that have become available during the last two decades. This use of modern data sources combined with an extensive reference list makes the book valuable as a reference text for graduate students of physical oceanography and researchers in the field. Meteorologists interested in the ocean\'s role in climate variability and climate change will find the book a helpful introduction to the interaction between ocean and atmosphere.

In order to step up shrimp production various organizations in the country have initiated efforts to develop appropriate technologies for shrimp culture, and as a result of this, the shrimp farming has taken roots in the country now. Encouraged by several promotional programmes offered by the Government agencies and the techno-economic viability of commercial shrimp farming demonstrated by the research and development organizations in the country shrimp farming has emerged as 'Sunrise' industry. Andhra Pradesh in particular is experiencing shrimp culture 'book' along its 982 kms. coast line. This volume based on the author's doctoral, dissertation, made a pioneering attempt to explain the economics of brackishwater shrimp culture, the effects of shrimp culture on the socio economic conditions of shrimp culture farmers, the factors that are inducing the farmers to take up this new venture. Analysing the advantageous of brackishwater shrimp culture, it points out the negative effects of unregulated shrimp culture activity on the environment. To ensure enduring benefits from the shrimp culture enterprise in the coastal areas, the book under scores the need for eco friendly aquaculture, without any indiscriminate conversion of agricultural lands into shrimp farming. This book Economics of Brackishwater Shrimp Culture all in all, a very useful contribution, that will have enduring value in both academic and policy formation circles.

The fisheries resources and their utilization are discussed separately for each state, with additional information on water quality, biotic communities, modes of exploitation, craft and gear and fisheries management practices, including the selection of species for stocking, rate and the introduction of exotic species. Indian reservoirs have been stocked with indo-Gangetic carp for many decades, and the impact of this stocking on fish production and the indigenous faunistic diversity has been assessed. An effort has been made to gauge the such as meteorlogical, morphometric and hydroedaphic features on the production dynamics of reservoirs in different geoclimatic regions. An attempt has also been made to resolve anomalies of classification and nomenclature to the extent possible. Factors responsible for the slow rate of fisheries development have been identified.

In the first project they studied various facets of the resources and problems of the reserve and prepared a detailed set of guidelines which formed the basis for preparation of Management Plan of BTR. The second project involved besides those of earlier works, a thorough study, on people, their education, awareness, research and monitoring and various other relevant issues especially in village co-development. The book also gives a broad-base information on the past history of various tiger reserves, fact-based details on vegetation, predator and prey animals and problems of most of these reserves. This indepth work of Buxa Tiger Reserve which deals with various facets of background political history, management history, various biotic and abiotic factors, problem, peoples' dependence on forests also suggest some remedial measures. Ecodevelopment, improved P.A. management, awareness, research, monitoring etc. have been discussed and achievement analysed. It is hoped this case study will act as a 'Model' for future such studies in most of the Tiger Reserves.

The Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary is one of such protected area in Assam in North Eastern India. The area is famous for the highest density of the Indian one-horned Rhinoceros in the world. The sanctuary is also well known for its wetland habitat which provides the suitable site for migratory birds and fish fauna. The present study highlights the floristic wealth of the sanctuary which is the outcome of the intensive botanical collection and observation for the period of four year from 1995 to 1998. The present book presents the botanical accounts, phytogeography, vegetation and ecosystem of the sanctuary. It covers 724 species under 492 genera 142 families of vascular plants. The work also focus the pattern of floristic diversity, phenology of some common plants with a brief account of fodder plants, medicinal, economically important plants, rare and endemic plants etc of the area. The study based on the revised taxonomic monographic work and recent taxonomic nomenclature.
