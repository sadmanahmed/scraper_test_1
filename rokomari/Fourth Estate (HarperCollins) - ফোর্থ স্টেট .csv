He records the contents of his citizens' minds onto tape reels for archival storage. Later in Hedayat's young life, as the unnameable country collapses into disarray around him, he begins an epistle, wherein, interspersed with accounts of contemporary terrorist attacks and the outbreak of a mysterious viral epidemic, he invokes the memories of his ancestors to revisit the troubled country's history and expose the root of its crisis. Hedayat's dark world is entirely foreign but oddly familiar, echoing the banality of our daily diversions and adding a terrifying twist. The Mirror, a gruesome, never-ending reality show, turns the city of La Maga into a permanent Hollywood-style film set where people gamble body parts and live in fear of the Black Organs, the paramilitary manifestation of the eviscerators that threaten to infect the nation. Islam's vibrant, ingenious construction sends the plot twisting down rabbit holes and caterwauling through secret doorways to emerge anywhere from a domestic living room to a bomb technician's workshop to the deep recesses of the state's repressive political apparatus. A remarkable debut, filled with original characters and rendered in uniquely inventive language, Fire in the Unnameable Country is a book like no other.",Fire in the Unnameable Country,Ghalib Islam, , ,Fourth Estate (HarperCollins),9789351367208,"4th Edition,2014",450,India,English

A biographer begins to document the life of an enigmatic and controversial political luminary - Babu, also known as 'Babu Bangladesh. In unearthing the story of a man who many thought was the leader of his generation, he begins to uncover the story of a nation itself.
Buildings acquire consciousness to chart political outcomes, a tree stands defiantly even as marauding troops try to blast it out of existence, tribes of snake and tree worshippers compete for regional supremacy, even as fish-humanoids emerge from the waters ... Flitting between fantasy and reality, manoeuvring through the rainforest swamps of Bangladesh with as much ease as the immigrant colonies of New York, blurring the boundaries between myth, history and truth, Babu Bangladesh! is a work of stunning scope and ambition from the most exciting literary voice to emerge from the Subcontinent in years.",Babu Bangladesh!,Numair Atif Choudhury, , ,Fourth Estate (HarperCollins),9789353570576,"1st Published,2019",403,India,English

Obey - Accept - Serve.

Born into the lowest class of her society, Flora 717 is a sanitation bee, only fit to clean her orchard hive. Living to accept, obey and serve, she is prepared to sacrifice everything for her beloved holy mother, the Queen. But Flora is not like other bees. Despite her ugliness she has talents that are not typical of her kin. While mutant bees are usually instantly destroyed, Flora is removed from sanitation duty and is allowed to feed the newborns, before becoming a forager, collecting pollen on the wing. She also finds her way into the queens inner sanctum, where she discovers secrets both sublime and ominous.

But enemies are everywhere, from the fearsome fertility police to the high priestesses who jealously guard the hive mind and when Flora breaks the most sacred law of all her instinct to serve is overshadowed by an even deeper desire, a fierce maternal love that will lead to the unthinkable.

Laline Paulls chilling yet ultimately triumphant novel creates a luminous world both alien and uncannily familiar. Thrilling and imaginative, the bees is the story of a heroine who, in the face of an increasingly desperate struggle for survival, changes her destiny and her world.",Bees,Laline Paull, , ,Fourth Estate (HarperCollins),9780007598892,"1st edition,2014",352,India,English
