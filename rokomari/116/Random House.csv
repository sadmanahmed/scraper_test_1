In Who Moved My Cheese?: An Amazing Way To Deal With Change In Your Work And In Your Life, Spencer Johnson reveals how people can adapt to change in a positive manner. Beginning with an introduction by Kenneth Blanchard, the book reveals the story behind the main story. Johnson, in this book, employs the parable form to give readers insight on change and how to cope with it.

The book narrates the tale of four creatures, two mice and two tiny humans who are on a hunt for cheese. The author encapsulates the four predictable and typical reactions when the cheese is moved. Sniff and Scurry, the mice, and Hem and Haw, the humans, are initially happy with the seemingly unending supply at Cheese Station C, but are discontent when the supply starts getting depleted. Who Moved My Cheese takes this situation and discusses the best ways to react in such a situation. Instead of blaming others or resisting change, Spencer advises the readers to anticipate, monitor, adapt and enjoy the change. This short tale reminds readers that change should not hinder progress.

This tale of the four characters in the maze is similar to that of all the people who are hunting for good jobs, money, stable relationships and success. Spencer Johnson shows us how we can successfully deal with the inevitable changes in life. First published in 1998, the book has remained popular among readers of all ages. The book was on the New York Times business bestseller list for five years and has sold over 26 million copies and translated to many languages.

In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us into the thrilling and surprising world of the scientific study of habits.
He examines why some people and companies struggle to change,
despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. He visits laboratories where neuroscientists explore how
habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. And he uncovers how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and
civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr.
The result is a compelling argument and an empowering discovery: the key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive or even building revolutionary companies is understanding how habits work. By harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities,
and our lives.

How do you go about it? Billions of government dollars, and thousands of charitable organizations and NGOs, are dedicated to helping the worlds poor. But much of their work is based on assumptions about the poor and the world that are untested generalizations at best, harmful misperceptions at worst.

Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo have pioneered the use of randomized control trials (RCTs) in development economics through their award-winning Poverty Action Lab. They argue that by using RCTs and, more generally, by paying careful attention to the evidence, it is possible to make accurate and often startling assessments on what really impacts the poor and what doesnt.

Revelatory and impassioned, Poor Economics is a pathbreaking book that will help you to understand the real causes of poverty and how to end it.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life explores the history of human efforts to unravel the puzzles of the Universe. It starts with the Greeks. Particularly the Ionian Greeks and their contention that the the Universe had to have a cause based on the laws of science.

It covers landmark discoveries, like that of Copernicus who showed that the Earth was not the center of the Universe. It explains the various laws of physics that have provided answers to so many things that have puzzled people for long. The authors show that the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Physics have together helped humans understand many of the deep mysteries about the Universe. But the quest to find a single theory, a unified theory that will explain everything about everything has been elusive.

This Theory of Everything was a dream of Einstein, and other scientists have continued the quest. The Theory of Everything has had several candidates, and the latest is the M-Theory which the authors present as the most likely solution. They contend that the new discoveries make God unnecessary. They say that the laws of physics show that the Universe is a result of spontaneous creation.

They also explore the M-Theory further and explain that just like ours is not the only galaxy in the Universe, our Universe is not the only one out there. In fact, there might be one universe for each possible outcome of a situation, so the Universe that a person sees is a perception of reality from their viewpoint. They also propose that these universes could be so vastly different, some may not be capable of supporting life forms.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life is an intriguing exploration of all the discoveries that revealed the secrets of the Universe, and where science could proceed from now. It explains how physics could soon provide the ultimate answers to all the mysteries of the Universe.

The narrative begins with Obama’s life in Harvard Law School. Born in Hawaii, he led a difficult life having to deal with his parents’ divorce when he was only two. The absence of his father who was too busy finishing his Ph.D. in Harvard, led him to create an imaginary father figure for himself.

Obama’s mother remarried and the whole family moved to Jakarta. However, Obama returned to his grandparents in Hawaii for pursuing his education. Being the only black kid in his high school, things were rough on young Barack. Yet, he connected with the African-American community in Hawaii. This influenced him to a great extent.

In Occidental College, Obama described a different and carefree kind of life. After this, he moved to New York and majored in political science in Columbia University.

This book does not merely iterate the biographic details of the life led. The author emphasizes the pain, the emotions, and the jubilation he felt at every challenge he faced and eventually overcame.

At one point of the narrative, the author describes his journey to Kenya and meeting his relatives for the first time. This book stresses on the importance of race-relations and the need to obliterate racial divide.

Smith's seminal work, The Wealth of Nations, aims to create a new understanding of economics. Smith writes largely against the mercantile system that existed at the time of writing, but, along the way, gives a complicated but brilliant account of an economic system based in human nature and deeply rooted social dynamics. The text is characterized by fact-heavy digressions, tables, and appendices that blend hard research with broad generalities, demonstrating his commitment to give evidence for what seem like timeless observations about the nature of economics.

Books I and II focus on developing the idea of the division of labor, and describing how this division adds to the opulence of a given society by creating enormous surpluses, which can be exchanged among members. The division of labor also fuels technological innovation, by giving intense focus to certain tasks, and allowing workers to brainstorm ways to make these tasks more efficient. This, again, adds to efficiency and grows surpluses. Surpluses, Smith writes, may be either traded or re-invested. In the latter case, technologies are likely to improve, leading to even greater efficiencies.

Book III considers Great Britain in the context of the the social evolution of society in general, which begins, according to Smith, with hunting and gathering societies and progresses through agricultural stages to arrive at a state of international commerce. According to Smith, the fall of Rome and the rise of feudalism retarded this progression by creating a system of decreased efficiency.

Book IV goes on to criticize the “mercantile commerce” that characterized much of Smith's Europe. Smith's first major criticism of mercantilism is that it conflates value and wealth with precious metals. According to Smith, the real measure of the wealth of a nation is the stream of goods and services that the nation creates. In making this point, Smith invents the idea of gross domestic product, which has become central to modern economics. The wealth of a nation is increased not by hoarding metals, but by increasing the productive capacity by expanding the market—by increasing trade.

An important theme that persists throughout the work is the idea that the economic system is automatic, and, when left with substantial freedom, able to regulate itself. This is often referred to as the “invisible hand.” The ability to self-regulate and to ensure maximum efficiency, however, is threatened by monopolies, tax preferences, lobbying groups, and other “privileges” extended to certain members of the economy at the expense of others.

Finally, in the last book of The Wealth of Nations, Smith describes what he considers to be the appropriate roles of government, namely defense, justice, the creation and maintenance of public works that contribute to commerce, education, the maintenance of the “dignity of the sovereign,”—activities that are to be financed by fair and clear taxation.

Different ideologies. A love story. A country’s movement and lives spanning over decades, deciphering the map of the human heart. This could be in short the plot of The Lowland, the latest by Jhumpa Lahiri. And yet is a lot more than this. Jhumpa Lahiri’s books are never easy. They may seem an easy read on the surface, however a lot of complex emotions seethe underneath and that is just the case with “The Lowland”.

Jhumpa’s writing is not only surreal but also very high on the emotional factor. At the same time it isn’t overdone. The emotions are as subtle as the characters. The writing needs to be spoken more about – it is almost like every sentence had to be written or else the novel would be incomplete.

All one can say is that it is only befitting for her to be on the long and short list of the Booker Prize. If there is one book you must read this year, it has to be this one.

The ghosts of Grey’s past constantly tested the affair and although Ana knew the complexity of her ‘fifty shades’ there is no easy way to tackle a fascinating man with repulsive tastes. As she demands more than what Grey wills her to have, they grow apart only to be consumed further into their relationship which now must brave the trials that loving another involves.

Fifty Shades Freed opens with Ana and Grey finally together after the tumultuous affair they shared in the last two books are consummated. Ana is prepared to brave every battle for her part in this relationship but sometimes when fate deals a bad hand, there is really little chance in braving its trials. With Grey acquiring a company called SIP, Ana is still struggling with Christian’s past and his controlling behavior, the couple is battling more than anyone’s fair share of woes.

But there is more to this love affair than meets the eye of any common spectator or reader, as these two young adults believe in the power of their commitment. And this tides them across to better times. Although it might seem that their love survives the perils of life, they are tested yet again and this time, it is much worse than anything that both of them had anticipated, much less prepared for. The plot takes another turn when Mia is kidnapped and held for ransom.

E. L. James delivers a powerful close to the immensely popular trilogy through this book. Fifty Shades Freed engages the themes of past trauma in a most engaging manner in which both Ana and Christian are embroiled in and conflicted with. It was published in 2012 and opened to commercial acclaim.

Harris was looking for ways to transcend the limited results and slow processes involved in conventional psychiatry. He wanted to offer people a unique, accessible, and affordable solution to resolve their life problems. The method of Transactional Analysis (TA), pioneered by Eric Berne, lent itself very well to be that solution.

Transactional Analysis is a psychotherapy model that is based on the idea that adults always carry remnants of emotionally intense childhood experiences. Harris uses this model to link it to the work of a brain surgeon named Wilder Penfield. The latter conducted pioneering experiments to uncover the neurological basis of memory.

Drawing from the work of Berne and Wilder, Harris proceeds to introduce readers to a simplified version of TA or what he calls the Parent, Adult, Child (P-A-C) Model. According to this simplified model, in any given situation, a person switches between one of three psychological states, namely the Parent, the Adult, the Child.

The model further explores how, over the transition from childhood to adulthood, an individual’s opinions take shape, either through conditioning by rules or through his/her own examination of the world around. The book also puts forth a set of four ‘life positions’, any of which an individual assumes depending on a particular situation.

After detailing the P-A-C model, Harris goes on to explain how this model can form the basis for a positive, improved future for any individual, regardless of what has or has not transpired in his/her past. He presents invaluable techniques to help readers achieve mastery over themselves, their relationships, and their future.

I’m OK, You’re OK was first published in 1967. Its popularity soared continuously and it stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for two years. It has been translated into more than twelve languages and has sold more than 15 million copies.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done will teach readers how to master the art of execution by understanding strategy, operations, and how to link people together. These three processes are at the center of every business.

The book clearly points out that top leaders give too much importance to creating a vision, devising strategies, and formulating plans. After doing so, they remove themselves from the picture and delegate tasks to their subordinates. This methodology is frowned upon in this book. Instead, it is recommended that leaders should adopt a hands-on approach. According to the authors, it very important to be passionate and deeply involved in one’s organization. Having robust dialogues about individuals, operations, and strategies, results in a business culture that is based on realism and honesty. Therefore actually “running” a business depends on carrying out these processes and not necessarily having a vision and leaving the responsibility of execution on others.

The authors also maintain that one important job that a leader must execute is choosing and evaluating people. A task that should not be passed on to others. This entails personally checking references for key candidates and ensures that the right people will be selected for the right job. A gene pool with leadership is able to conceive and select strategies for execution that are in alignment with the economy, competition, and marketplace. When the right individual and strategy are selected, an operating procedure is chosen. This results in specific programs getting implemented and assigning accountability. The methodology outlined in this book is effective because it spells out an operating process which transcends the usual way of looking at budget and goals.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done was published in 2011.

Can decline be detected early and avoided? How far can a company fall before the path toward doom becomes inevitable and unshakable? How can companies reverse course?\n\nIn How the Mighty Fall, Collins confronts these questions, offering leaders the well-founded hope that they can learn how to stave off decline and, if they find themselves falling, reverse their course. Collins? research project?more than four years in duration?uncovered five step-wise stages of decline: \n\nStage 1: Hubris Born of Success\nStage 2: Undisciplined Pursuit of More\nStage 3: Denial of Risk and Peril\nStage 4: Grasping for Salvation\nStage 5: Capitulation to Irrelevance or Death\n\nBy understanding these stages of decline, leaders can substantially reduce their chances of falling all the way to the bottom.\n\nGreat companies can stumble, badly, and recover.\n\nEvery institution, no matter how great, is vulnerable to decline. There is no law of nature that the most powerful will inevitably remain at the top. Anyone can fall and most eventually do. But, as Collins? research emphasizes, some companies do indeed recover?in some cases, coming back even stronger?even after having crashed into the depths of Stage 4.\n\nDecline, it turns out, is largely self-inflicted, and the path to recovery lies largely within our own hands. We are not imprisoned by our circumstances, our history, or even our staggering defeats along the way. As long as we never get entirely knocked out of the game, hope always remains. The mighty can fall, but they can often rise again.

So why can we not solve them? According to Edward de Bono, world thinking cannot solve world problems because world thinking is itself the problem. And this is getting worse: we are so accustomed to readily available information online that we search immediately for the answers rather than thinking about them. Our minds function like trying to drive a car using only one wheel. There's nothing wrong with that one wheel - conventional thinking - but we could all get a lot further if we used all four... De Bono examines why we think the way we do from a historical perspective and uses some of his famous thinking techniques combined with new ideas to show us how to change the way we think. If we strengthen our ability and raise our thinking level, other areas of our life - both personal and business success - will improve.

What happens when there is almost unlimited choice? When everything becomes available to everyone? And when the combined value of the millions of items that only sell in small quantities equals or even exceeds the value of a handful of best-sellers?

In this ground-breaking book, Chris Anderson shows that the future of business does not lie in hits - the high-volume end of a traditional demand curve - but in what used to be regarded as misses - the endlessly long tail of that same curve. As our world is transformed by the Internet and the near infinite choice it offers consumers, so traditional business models are being overturned and new truths revealed about what consumers want and how they want to get it.

Chris Anderson first explored the Long Tail in an article in Wired magazine that has become one of the most influential business essays of our time. Now, in this eagerly anticipated book, he takes a closer look at the new economics of the Internet age, showing where business is going and exploring the huge opportunities that exist: for new producers, new e-tailers, and new tastemakers. He demonstrates how long tail economics apply to industries ranging from the toy business to advertising to kitchen appliances. He sets down the rules for operating in a long tail economy. And he provides a glimpse of a future that's already here.",The Long Tail: How Endless Choice is Creating Unlimited Demand,Chris Anderson, , ,Random House,9781847940360,"1st Edition,2009",267,India,English

In Who Moved My Cheese?: An Amazing Way To Deal With Change In Your Work And In Your Life, Spencer Johnson reveals how people can adapt to change in a positive manner. Beginning with an introduction by Kenneth Blanchard, the book reveals the story behind the main story. Johnson, in this book, employs the parable form to give readers insight on change and how to cope with it.

The book narrates the tale of four creatures, two mice and two tiny humans who are on a hunt for cheese. The author encapsulates the four predictable and typical reactions when the cheese is moved. Sniff and Scurry, the mice, and Hem and Haw, the humans, are initially happy with the seemingly unending supply at Cheese Station C, but are discontent when the supply starts getting depleted. Who Moved My Cheese takes this situation and discusses the best ways to react in such a situation. Instead of blaming others or resisting change, Spencer advises the readers to anticipate, monitor, adapt and enjoy the change. This short tale reminds readers that change should not hinder progress.

This tale of the four characters in the maze is similar to that of all the people who are hunting for good jobs, money, stable relationships and success. Spencer Johnson shows us how we can successfully deal with the inevitable changes in life. First published in 1998, the book has remained popular among readers of all ages. The book was on the New York Times business bestseller list for five years and has sold over 26 million copies and translated to many languages.

In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us into the thrilling and surprising world of the scientific study of habits.
He examines why some people and companies struggle to change,
despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. He visits laboratories where neuroscientists explore how
habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. And he uncovers how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and
civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr.
The result is a compelling argument and an empowering discovery: the key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive or even building revolutionary companies is understanding how habits work. By harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities,
and our lives.

How do you go about it? Billions of government dollars, and thousands of charitable organizations and NGOs, are dedicated to helping the worlds poor.

Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo have pioneered the use of randomized control trials (RCTs) in development economics through their award-winning Poverty Action Lab. They argue that by using RCTs and, more generally, by paying careful attention to the evidence, it is possible to make accurate and often startling assessments on what really impacts the poor and what doesnt.

Revelatory and impassioned, Poor Economics is a pathbreaking book that will help you to understand the real causes of poverty and how to end it.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life explores the history of human efforts to unravel the puzzles of the Universe. It starts with the Greeks. Particularly the Ionian Greeks and their contention that the the Universe had to have a cause based on the laws of science.

It covers landmark discoveries, like that of Copernicus who showed that the Earth was not the center of the Universe. It explains the various laws of physics that have provided answers to so many things that have puzzled people for long. The authors show that the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Physics have together helped humans understand many of the deep mysteries about the Universe. But the quest to find a single theory, a unified theory that will explain everything about everything has been elusive.

This Theory of Everything was a dream of Einstein, and other scientists have continued the quest. The Theory of Everything has had several candidates, and the latest is the M-Theory which the authors present as the most likely solution. They contend that the new discoveries make God unnecessary. They say that the laws of physics show that the Universe is a result of spontaneous creation.

They also explore the M-Theory further and explain that just like ours is not the only galaxy in the Universe, our Universe is not the only one out there. In fact, there might be one universe for each possible outcome of a situation, so the Universe that a person sees is a perception of reality from their viewpoint. They also propose that these universes could be so vastly different, some may not be capable of supporting life forms.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life is an intriguing exploration of all the discoveries that revealed the secrets of the Universe, and where science could proceed from now. It explains how physics could soon provide the ultimate answers to all the mysteries of the Universe.

The narrative begins with Obama’s life in Harvard Law School. Born in Hawaii, he led a difficult life having to deal with his parents’ divorce when he was only two. The absence of his father who was too busy finishing his Ph.D. in Harvard, led him to create an imaginary father figure for himself.

Obama’s mother remarried and the whole family moved to Jakarta. However, Obama returned to his grandparents in Hawaii for pursuing his education. Being the only black kid in his high school, things were rough on young Barack. Yet, he connected with the African-American community in Hawaii. This influenced him to a great extent.

In Occidental College, Obama described a different and carefree kind of life. After this, he moved to New York and majored in political science in Columbia University.

This book does not merely iterate the biographic details of the life led. The author emphasizes the pain, the emotions, and the jubilation he felt at every challenge he faced and eventually overcame.

At one point of the narrative, the author describes his journey to Kenya and meeting his relatives for the first time. This book stresses on the importance of race-relations and the need to obliterate racial divide.

Smith's seminal work, The Wealth of Nations, aims to create a new understanding of economics. Smith writes largely against the mercantile system that existed at the time of writing, but, along the way, gives a complicated but brilliant account of an economic system based in human nature and deeply rooted social dynamics. The text is characterized by fact-heavy digressions, tables, and appendices that blend hard research with broad generalities, demonstrating his commitment to give evidence for what seem like timeless observations about the nature of economics.

Books I and II focus on developing the idea of the division of labor, and describing how this division adds to the opulence of a given society by creating enormous surpluses, which can be exchanged among members. The division of labor also fuels technological innovation, by giving intense focus to certain tasks, and allowing workers to brainstorm ways to make these tasks more efficient. This, again, adds to efficiency and grows surpluses. Surpluses, Smith writes, may be either traded or re-invested. In the latter case, technologies are likely to improve, leading to even greater efficiencies.

Book III considers Great Britain in the context of the the social evolution of society in general, which begins, according to Smith, with hunting and gathering societies and progresses through agricultural stages to arrive at a state of international commerce. According to Smith, the fall of Rome and the rise of feudalism retarded this progression by creating a system of decreased efficiency.

Book IV goes on to criticize the “mercantile commerce” that characterized much of Smith's Europe. Smith's first major criticism of mercantilism is that it conflates value and wealth with precious metals. According to Smith, the real measure of the wealth of a nation is the stream of goods and services that the nation creates. In making this point, Smith invents the idea of gross domestic product, which has become central to modern economics. The wealth of a nation is increased not by hoarding metals, but by increasing the productive capacity by expanding the market—by increasing trade.

An important theme that persists throughout the work is the idea that the economic system is automatic, and, when left with substantial freedom, able to regulate itself. This is often referred to as the “invisible hand.” The ability to self-regulate and to ensure maximum efficiency, however, is threatened by monopolies, tax preferences, lobbying groups, and other “privileges” extended to certain members of the economy at the expense of others.

Different ideologies. A love story. A country’s movement and lives spanning over decades, deciphering the map of the human heart. This could be in short the plot of The Lowland, the latest by Jhumpa Lahiri. And yet is a lot more than this. Jhumpa Lahiri’s books are never easy. They may seem an easy read on the surface, however a lot of complex emotions seethe underneath and that is just the case with “The Lowland”.

Jhumpa’s writing is not only surreal but also very high on the emotional factor. At the same time it isn’t overdone. The emotions are as subtle as the characters. The writing needs to be spoken more about – it is almost like every sentence had to be written or else the novel would be incomplete.

All one can say is that it is only befitting for her to be on the long and short list of the Booker Prize. If there is one book you must read this year, it has to be this one.

The ghosts of Grey’s past constantly tested the affair and although Ana knew the complexity of her ‘fifty shades’ there is no easy way to tackle a fascinating man with repulsive tastes. As she demands more than what Grey wills her to have, they grow apart only to be consumed further into their relationship which now must brave the trials that loving another involves.

Fifty Shades Freed opens with Ana and Grey finally together after the tumultuous affair they shared in the last two books are consummated. Ana is prepared to brave every battle for her part in this relationship but sometimes when fate deals a bad hand, there is really little chance in braving its trials. With Grey acquiring a company called SIP, Ana is still struggling with Christian’s past and his controlling behavior, the couple is battling more than anyone’s fair share of woes.

But there is more to this love affair than meets the eye of any common spectator or reader, as these two young adults believe in the power of their commitment. And this tides them across to better times. Although it might seem that their love survives the perils of life, they are tested yet again and this time, it is much worse than anything that both of them had anticipated, much less prepared for. The plot takes another turn when Mia is kidnapped and held for ransom.

E. L. James delivers a powerful close to the immensely popular trilogy through this book. Fifty Shades Freed engages the themes of past trauma in a most engaging manner in which both Ana and Christian are embroiled in and conflicted with. It was published in 2012 and opened to commercial acclaim.

Harris was looking for ways to transcend the limited results and slow processes involved in conventional psychiatry. He wanted to offer people a unique, accessible, and affordable solution to resolve their life problems. The method of Transactional Analysis (TA), pioneered by Eric Berne, lent itself very well to be that solution.

Transactional Analysis is a psychotherapy model that is based on the idea that adults always carry remnants of emotionally intense childhood experiences. Harris uses this model to link it to the work of a brain surgeon named Wilder Penfield. The latter conducted pioneering experiments to uncover the neurological basis of memory.

Drawing from the work of Berne and Wilder, Harris proceeds to introduce readers to a simplified version of TA or what he calls the Parent, Adult, Child (P-A-C) Model. According to this simplified model, in any given situation, a person switches between one of three psychological states, namely the Parent, the Adult, the Child.

The model further explores how, over the transition from childhood to adulthood, an individual’s opinions take shape, either through conditioning by rules or through his/her own examination of the world around. The book also puts forth a set of four ‘life positions’, any of which an individual assumes depending on a particular situation.

After detailing the P-A-C model, Harris goes on to explain how this model can form the basis for a positive, improved future for any individual, regardless of what has or has not transpired in his/her past. He presents invaluable techniques to help readers achieve mastery over themselves, their relationships, and their future.

I’m OK, You’re OK was first published in 1967. Its popularity soared continuously and it stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for two years. It has been translated into more than twelve languages and has sold more than 15 million copies.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done will teach readers how to master the art of execution by understanding strategy, operations, and how to link people together. These three processes are at the center of every business.

The book clearly points out that top leaders give too much importance to creating a vision, devising strategies, and formulating plans. After doing so, they remove themselves from the picture and delegate tasks to their subordinates. This methodology is frowned upon in this book. Instead, it is recommended that leaders should adopt a hands-on approach. According to the authors, it very important to be passionate and deeply involved in one’s organization. Having robust dialogues about individuals, operations, and strategies, results in a business culture that is based on realism and honesty. Therefore actually “running” a business depends on carrying out these processes and not necessarily having a vision and leaving the responsibility of execution on others.

The authors also maintain that one important job that a leader must execute is choosing and evaluating people. A task that should not be passed on to others. This entails personally checking references for key candidates and ensures that the right people will be selected for the right job. A gene pool with leadership is able to conceive and select strategies for execution that are in alignment with the economy, competition, and marketplace. When the right individual and strategy are selected, an operating procedure is chosen. This results in specific programs getting implemented and assigning accountability. The methodology outlined in this book is effective because it spells out an operating process which transcends the usual way of looking at budget and goals.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done was published in 2011.

How can companies reverse course?\n\nIn How the Mighty Fall, Collins confronts these questions, offering leaders the well-founded hope that they can learn how to stave off decline and, if they find themselves falling, reverse their course. Collins? research project?more than four years in duration?uncovered five step-wise stages of decline: \n\nStage 1: Hubris Born of Success\nStage 2: Undisciplined Pursuit of More\nStage 3: Denial of Risk and Peril\nStage 4: Grasping for Salvation\nStage 5: Capitulation to Irrelevance or Death\n\nBy understanding these stages of decline, leaders can substantially reduce their chances of falling all the way to the bottom.\n\nGreat companies can stumble, badly, and recover.\n\nEvery institution, no matter how great, is vulnerable to decline. There is no law of nature that the most powerful will inevitably remain at the top. Anyone can fall and most eventually do. But, as Collins? research emphasizes, some companies do indeed recover?in some cases, coming back even stronger?even after having crashed into the depths of Stage 4.\n\nDecline, it turns out, is largely self-inflicted, and the path to recovery lies largely within our own hands. We are not imprisoned by our circumstances, our history, or even our staggering defeats along the way. As long as we never get entirely knocked out of the game, hope always remains. The mighty can fall, but they can often rise again.

So why can we not solve them? According to Edward de Bono, world thinking cannot solve world problems because world thinking is itself the problem. And this is getting worse: we are so accustomed to readily available information online that we search immediately for the answers rather than thinking about them. Our minds function like trying to drive a car using only one wheel. There's nothing wrong with that one wheel - conventional thinking - but we could all get a lot further if we used all four... De Bono examines why we think the way we do from a historical perspective and uses some of his famous thinking techniques combined with new ideas to show us how to change the way we think. If we strengthen our ability and raise our thinking level, other areas of our life - both personal and business success - will improve. De Bono is the master of the original big 'concept' book and his enticement to us to use our minds as constructively as possible should appeal to a whole new generation of fans",Think!

What happens when there is almost unlimited choice? When everything becomes available to everyone? And when the combined value of the millions of items that only sell in small quantities equals or even exceeds the value of a handful of best-sellers?

In this ground-breaking book, Chris Anderson shows that the future of business does not lie in hits - the high-volume end of a traditional demand curve - but in what used to be regarded as misses - the endlessly long tail of that same curve. As our world is transformed by the Internet and the near infinite choice it offers consumers, so traditional business models are being overturned and new truths revealed about what consumers want and how they want to get it.

Chris Anderson first explored the Long Tail in an article in Wired magazine that has become one of the most influential business essays of our time. Now, in this eagerly anticipated book, he takes a closer look at the new economics of the Internet age, showing where business is going and exploring the huge opportunities that exist: for new producers, new e-tailers, and new tastemakers. He demonstrates how long tail economics apply to industries ranging from the toy business to advertising to kitchen appliances. He sets down the rules for operating in a long tail economy. And he provides a glimpse of a future that's already here.",The Long Tail: How Endless Choice is Creating Unlimited Demand,Chris Anderson, , ,Random House,9781847940360,"1st Edition,2009",267,India,English

For the multimillionaire Hannibal left maimed, for a corrupt Italian policeman, and for FBI agent Clarice Starling, who once stood before Lecter and who has never been the same, the final hunt for Hannibal Lecter has begun. All of them, in their separate ways, want to find Dr. Lecter. And all three will get their wish.

In Who Moved My Cheese?: An Amazing Way To Deal With Change In Your Work And In Your Life, Spencer Johnson reveals how people can adapt to change in a positive manner. Beginning with an introduction by Kenneth Blanchard, the book reveals the story behind the main story. Johnson, in this book, employs the parable form to give readers insight on change and how to cope with it.

The book narrates the tale of four creatures, two mice and two tiny humans who are on a hunt for cheese. The author encapsulates the four predictable and typical reactions when the cheese is moved. Sniff and Scurry, the mice, and Hem and Haw, the humans, are initially happy with the seemingly unending supply at Cheese Station C, but are discontent when the supply starts getting depleted. Who Moved My Cheese takes this situation and discusses the best ways to react in such a situation. Instead of blaming others or resisting change, Spencer advises the readers to anticipate, monitor, adapt and enjoy the change. This short tale reminds readers that change should not hinder progress.

This tale of the four characters in the maze is similar to that of all the people who are hunting for good jobs, money, stable relationships and success. Spencer Johnson shows us how we can successfully deal with the inevitable changes in life. First published in 1998, the book has remained popular among readers of all ages. The book was on the New York Times business bestseller list for five years and has sold over 26 million copies and translated to many languages.

In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us into the thrilling and surprising world of the scientific study of habits.
He examines why some people and companies struggle to change,
despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. He visits laboratories where neuroscientists explore how
habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. And he uncovers how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and
civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr.
The result is a compelling argument and an empowering discovery: the key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive or even building revolutionary companies is understanding how habits work. By harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities,
and our lives.

How do you go about it? Billions of government dollars, and thousands of charitable organizations and NGOs, are dedicated to helping the worlds poor. But much of their work is based on assumptions about the poor and the world that are untested generalizations at best, harmful misperceptions at worst.

Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo have pioneered the use of randomized control trials (RCTs) in development economics through their award-winning Poverty Action Lab. They argue that by using RCTs and, more generally, by paying careful attention to the evidence, it is possible to make accurate and often startling assessments on what really impacts the poor and what doesnt.

Revelatory and impassioned, Poor Economics is a pathbreaking book that will help you to understand the real causes of poverty and how to end it.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life explores the history of human efforts to unravel the puzzles of the Universe. It starts with the Greeks. Particularly the Ionian Greeks and their contention that the the Universe had to have a cause based on the laws of science.

It covers landmark discoveries, like that of Copernicus who showed that the Earth was not the center of the Universe. It explains the various laws of physics that have provided answers to so many things that have puzzled people for long. The authors show that the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Physics have together helped humans understand many of the deep mysteries about the Universe. But the quest to find a single theory, a unified theory that will explain everything about everything has been elusive.

This Theory of Everything was a dream of Einstein, and other scientists have continued the quest. The Theory of Everything has had several candidates, and the latest is the M-Theory which the authors present as the most likely solution. They contend that the new discoveries make God unnecessary. They say that the laws of physics show that the Universe is a result of spontaneous creation.

They also explore the M-Theory further and explain that just like ours is not the only galaxy in the Universe, our Universe is not the only one out there. In fact, there might be one universe for each possible outcome of a situation, so the Universe that a person sees is a perception of reality from their viewpoint. They also propose that these universes could be so vastly different, some may not be capable of supporting life forms.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life is an intriguing exploration of all the discoveries that revealed the secrets of the Universe, and where science could proceed from now. It explains how physics could soon provide the ultimate answers to all the mysteries of the Universe.

Smith's seminal work, The Wealth of Nations, aims to create a new understanding of economics. Smith writes largely against the mercantile system that existed at the time of writing, but, along the way, gives a complicated but brilliant account of an economic system based in human nature and deeply rooted social dynamics. The text is characterized by fact-heavy digressions, tables, and appendices that blend hard research with broad generalities, demonstrating his commitment to give evidence for what seem like timeless observations about the nature of economics.

Books I and II focus on developing the idea of the division of labor, and describing how this division adds to the opulence of a given society by creating enormous surpluses, which can be exchanged among members. The division of labor also fuels technological innovation, by giving intense focus to certain tasks, and allowing workers to brainstorm ways to make these tasks more efficient. This, again, adds to efficiency and grows surpluses. Surpluses, Smith writes, may be either traded or re-invested. In the latter case, technologies are likely to improve, leading to even greater efficiencies.

Book III considers Great Britain in the context of the the social evolution of society in general, which begins, according to Smith, with hunting and gathering societies and progresses through agricultural stages to arrive at a state of international commerce. According to Smith, the fall of Rome and the rise of feudalism retarded this progression by creating a system of decreased efficiency.

Book IV goes on to criticize the “mercantile commerce” that characterized much of Smith's Europe. Smith's first major criticism of mercantilism is that it conflates value and wealth with precious metals. According to Smith, the real measure of the wealth of a nation is the stream of goods and services that the nation creates. In making this point, Smith invents the idea of gross domestic product, which has become central to modern economics. The wealth of a nation is increased not by hoarding metals, but by increasing the productive capacity by expanding the market—by increasing trade.

An important theme that persists throughout the work is the idea that the economic system is automatic, and, when left with substantial freedom, able to regulate itself. This is often referred to as the “invisible hand.” The ability to self-regulate and to ensure maximum efficiency, however, is threatened by monopolies, tax preferences, lobbying groups, and other “privileges” extended to certain members of the economy at the expense of others.

Finally, in the last book of The Wealth of Nations, Smith describes what he considers to be the appropriate roles of government, namely defense, justice, the creation and maintenance of public works that contribute to commerce, education, the maintenance of the “dignity of the sovereign,”—activities that are to be financed by fair and clear taxation.

Different ideologies. A love story. A country’s movement and lives spanning over decades, deciphering the map of the human heart. This could be in short the plot of The Lowland, the latest by Jhumpa Lahiri. And yet is a lot more than this. Jhumpa Lahiri’s books are never easy. They may seem an easy read on the surface, however a lot of complex emotions seethe underneath and that is just the case with “The Lowland”.

Jhumpa’s writing is not only surreal but also very high on the emotional factor. At the same time it isn’t overdone. The emotions are as subtle as the characters. The writing needs to be spoken more about – it is almost like every sentence had to be written or else the novel would be incomplete.

All one can say is that it is only befitting for her to be on the long and short list of the Booker Prize. If there is one book you must read this year, it has to be this one.

The ghosts of Grey’s past constantly tested the affair and although Ana knew the complexity of her ‘fifty shades’ there is no easy way to tackle a fascinating man with repulsive tastes. As she demands more than what Grey wills her to have, they grow apart only to be consumed further into their relationship which now must brave the trials that loving another involves.

Fifty Shades Freed opens with Ana and Grey finally together after the tumultuous affair they shared in the last two books are consummated. Ana is prepared to brave every battle for her part in this relationship but sometimes when fate deals a bad hand, there is really little chance in braving its trials. With Grey acquiring a company called SIP, Ana is still struggling with Christian’s past and his controlling behavior, the couple is battling more than anyone’s fair share of woes.

But there is more to this love affair than meets the eye of any common spectator or reader, as these two young adults believe in the power of their commitment. And this tides them across to better times. Although it might seem that their love survives the perils of life, they are tested yet again and this time, it is much worse than anything that both of them had anticipated, much less prepared for. The plot takes another turn when Mia is kidnapped and held for ransom.

E. L. James delivers a powerful close to the immensely popular trilogy through this book. Fifty Shades Freed engages the themes of past trauma in a most engaging manner in which both Ana and Christian are embroiled in and conflicted with. It was published in 2012 and opened to commercial acclaim.

Harris was looking for ways to transcend the limited results and slow processes involved in conventional psychiatry. He wanted to offer people a unique, accessible, and affordable solution to resolve their life problems. The method of Transactional Analysis (TA), pioneered by Eric Berne, lent itself very well to be that solution.

Transactional Analysis is a psychotherapy model that is based on the idea that adults always carry remnants of emotionally intense childhood experiences. Harris uses this model to link it to the work of a brain surgeon named Wilder Penfield. The latter conducted pioneering experiments to uncover the neurological basis of memory.

Drawing from the work of Berne and Wilder, Harris proceeds to introduce readers to a simplified version of TA or what he calls the Parent, Adult, Child (P-A-C) Model. According to this simplified model, in any given situation, a person switches between one of three psychological states, namely the Parent, the Adult, the Child.

The model further explores how, over the transition from childhood to adulthood, an individual’s opinions take shape, either through conditioning by rules or through his/her own examination of the world around. The book also puts forth a set of four ‘life positions’, any of which an individual assumes depending on a particular situation.

After detailing the P-A-C model, Harris goes on to explain how this model can form the basis for a positive, improved future for any individual, regardless of what has or has not transpired in his/her past. He presents invaluable techniques to help readers achieve mastery over themselves, their relationships, and their future.

I’m OK, You’re OK was first published in 1967. Its popularity soared continuously and it stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for two years. It has been translated into more than twelve languages and has sold more than 15 million copies.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done will teach readers how to master the art of execution by understanding strategy, operations, and how to link people together. These three processes are at the center of every business.

The book clearly points out that top leaders give too much importance to creating a vision, devising strategies, and formulating plans. After doing so, they remove themselves from the picture and delegate tasks to their subordinates. This methodology is frowned upon in this book. Instead, it is recommended that leaders should adopt a hands-on approach. According to the authors, it very important to be passionate and deeply involved in one’s organization. Having robust dialogues about individuals, operations, and strategies, results in a business culture that is based on realism and honesty. Therefore actually “running” a business depends on carrying out these processes and not necessarily having a vision and leaving the responsibility of execution on others.

The authors also maintain that one important job that a leader must execute is choosing and evaluating people. A task that should not be passed on to others. This entails personally checking references for key candidates and ensures that the right people will be selected for the right job. A gene pool with leadership is able to conceive and select strategies for execution that are in alignment with the economy, competition, and marketplace. When the right individual and strategy are selected, an operating procedure is chosen. This results in specific programs getting implemented and assigning accountability. The methodology outlined in this book is effective because it spells out an operating process which transcends the usual way of looking at budget and goals.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done was published in 2011.

The book offers an interesting and different take on the similarities between the struggles of the beloved superheroes and the rest of mankind. Drawing parallels between the internal struggles of the Incredible Hulk and Batman, Chopra explains how the readers can incorporate the laws towards the betterment of their self and the world.

Chopra has tried to project the essential qualities that go into making a superhero. The book explains the never ending battle between good and evil, dark and light. The Law of Balance, The Law of Transformation, The Law of Power, The Law of Love, The Law of Intention and The Law of Transcendence, form the major content of the book.

We are not imprisoned by our circumstances, our history, or even our staggering defeats along the way. As long as we never get entirely knocked out of the game, hope always remains. The mighty can fall, but they can often rise again.

So why can we not solve them? According to Edward de Bono, world thinking cannot solve world problems because world thinking is itself the problem. And this is getting worse: we are so accustomed to readily available information online that we search immediately for the answers rather than thinking about them. Our minds function like trying to drive a car using only one wheel. There's nothing wrong with that one wheel - conventional thinking - but we could all get a lot further if we used all four... De Bono examines why we think the way we do from a historical perspective and uses some of his famous thinking techniques combined with new ideas to show us how to change the way we think. If we strengthen our ability and raise our thinking level, other areas of our life - both personal and business success - will improve. De Bono is the master of the original big 'concept' book and his enticement to us to use our minds as constructively as possible should appeal to a whole new generation of fans",Think!

What happens when there is almost unlimited choice? When everything becomes available to everyone? And when the combined value of the millions of items that only sell in small quantities equals or even exceeds the value of a handful of best-sellers?

In this ground-breaking book, Chris Anderson shows that the future of business does not lie in hits - the high-volume end of a traditional demand curve - but in what used to be regarded as misses - the endlessly long tail of that same curve. As our world is transformed by the Internet and the near infinite choice it offers consumers, so traditional business models are being overturned and new truths revealed about what consumers want and how they want to get it.

Chris Anderson first explored the Long Tail in an article in Wired magazine that has become one of the most influential business essays of our time. Now, in this eagerly anticipated book, he takes a closer look at the new economics of the Internet age, showing where business is going and exploring the huge opportunities that exist: for new producers, new e-tailers, and new tastemakers. He demonstrates how long tail economics apply to industries ranging from the toy business to advertising to kitchen appliances. He sets down the rules for operating in a long tail economy. And he provides a glimpse of a future that's already here.",The Long Tail: How Endless Choice is Creating Unlimited Demand,Chris Anderson, , ,Random House,9781847940360,"1st Edition,2009",267,India,English

In Who Moved My Cheese?: An Amazing Way To Deal With Change In Your Work And In Your Life, Spencer Johnson reveals how people can adapt to change in a positive manner. Beginning with an introduction by Kenneth Blanchard, the book reveals the story behind the main story. Johnson, in this book, employs the parable form to give readers insight on change and how to cope with it.

The book narrates the tale of four creatures, two mice and two tiny humans who are on a hunt for cheese. The author encapsulates the four predictable and typical reactions when the cheese is moved. Sniff and Scurry, the mice, and Hem and Haw, the humans, are initially happy with the seemingly unending supply at Cheese Station C, but are discontent when the supply starts getting depleted. Who Moved My Cheese takes this situation and discusses the best ways to react in such a situation. Instead of blaming others or resisting change, Spencer advises the readers to anticipate, monitor, adapt and enjoy the change. This short tale reminds readers that change should not hinder progress.

This tale of the four characters in the maze is similar to that of all the people who are hunting for good jobs, money, stable relationships and success. Spencer Johnson shows us how we can successfully deal with the inevitable changes in life. First published in 1998, the book has remained popular among readers of all ages. The book was on the New York Times business bestseller list for five years and has sold over 26 million copies and translated to many languages.

In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us into the thrilling and surprising world of the scientific study of habits.
He examines why some people and companies struggle to change,
despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. He visits laboratories where neuroscientists explore how
habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. And he uncovers how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and
civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr.
The result is a compelling argument and an empowering discovery: the key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive or even building revolutionary companies is understanding how habits work. By harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities,
and our lives.

How do you go about it? Billions of government dollars, and thousands of charitable organizations and NGOs, are dedicated to helping the worlds poor. But much of their work is based on assumptions about the poor and the world that are untested generalizations at best, harmful misperceptions at worst.

Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo have pioneered the use of randomized control trials (RCTs) in development economics through their award-winning Poverty Action Lab. They argue that by using RCTs and, more generally, by paying careful attention to the evidence, it is possible to make accurate and often startling assessments on what really impacts the poor and what doesnt.

Revelatory and impassioned, Poor Economics is a pathbreaking book that will help you to understand the real causes of poverty and how to end it.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life explores the history of human efforts to unravel the puzzles of the Universe. It starts with the Greeks. Particularly the Ionian Greeks and their contention that the the Universe had to have a cause based on the laws of science.

It covers landmark discoveries, like that of Copernicus who showed that the Earth was not the center of the Universe. It explains the various laws of physics that have provided answers to so many things that have puzzled people for long. The authors show that the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Physics have together helped humans understand many of the deep mysteries about the Universe. But the quest to find a single theory, a unified theory that will explain everything about everything has been elusive.

This Theory of Everything was a dream of Einstein, and other scientists have continued the quest. The Theory of Everything has had several candidates, and the latest is the M-Theory which the authors present as the most likely solution. They contend that the new discoveries make God unnecessary. They say that the laws of physics show that the Universe is a result of spontaneous creation.

They also explore the M-Theory further and explain that just like ours is not the only galaxy in the Universe, our Universe is not the only one out there. In fact, there might be one universe for each possible outcome of a situation, so the Universe that a person sees is a perception of reality from their viewpoint. They also propose that these universes could be so vastly different, some may not be capable of supporting life forms.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life is an intriguing exploration of all the discoveries that revealed the secrets of the Universe, and where science could proceed from now. It explains how physics could soon provide the ultimate answers to all the mysteries of the Universe.

Smith's seminal work, The Wealth of Nations, aims to create a new understanding of economics. Smith writes largely against the mercantile system that existed at the time of writing, but, along the way, gives a complicated but brilliant account of an economic system based in human nature and deeply rooted social dynamics. The text is characterized by fact-heavy digressions, tables, and appendices that blend hard research with broad generalities, demonstrating his commitment to give evidence for what seem like timeless observations about the nature of economics.

Books I and II focus on developing the idea of the division of labor, and describing how this division adds to the opulence of a given society by creating enormous surpluses, which can be exchanged among members. The division of labor also fuels technological innovation, by giving intense focus to certain tasks, and allowing workers to brainstorm ways to make these tasks more efficient. This, again, adds to efficiency and grows surpluses. Surpluses, Smith writes, may be either traded or re-invested. In the latter case, technologies are likely to improve, leading to even greater efficiencies.

Book III considers Great Britain in the context of the the social evolution of society in general, which begins, according to Smith, with hunting and gathering societies and progresses through agricultural stages to arrive at a state of international commerce. According to Smith, the fall of Rome and the rise of feudalism retarded this progression by creating a system of decreased efficiency.

Book IV goes on to criticize the “mercantile commerce” that characterized much of Smith's Europe. Smith's first major criticism of mercantilism is that it conflates value and wealth with precious metals. According to Smith, the real measure of the wealth of a nation is the stream of goods and services that the nation creates. In making this point, Smith invents the idea of gross domestic product, which has become central to modern economics. The wealth of a nation is increased not by hoarding metals, but by increasing the productive capacity by expanding the market—by increasing trade.

An important theme that persists throughout the work is the idea that the economic system is automatic, and, when left with substantial freedom, able to regulate itself. This is often referred to as the “invisible hand.” The ability to self-regulate and to ensure maximum efficiency, however, is threatened by monopolies, tax preferences, lobbying groups, and other “privileges” extended to certain members of the economy at the expense of others.

Finally, in the last book of The Wealth of Nations, Smith describes what he considers to be the appropriate roles of government, namely defense, justice, the creation and maintenance of public works that contribute to commerce, education, the maintenance of the “dignity of the sovereign,”—activities that are to be financed by fair and clear taxation.

Children are flawed, because nature isn’t perfect. So why put up with the inefficiencies of nature in the first place? In this world where people are born in test tubes, everything is controlled by drug traffickers. Everyone is in on it, and genetic engineering, brainwashing and recreational sex and drugs are all the rage. No one is complaining, except for Bernard Marx. He alone wants to break free, and his only escape might be to go to one of the few remaining Savage Reservations, where the old way of life still survives.

Different ideologies. A love story. A country’s movement and lives spanning over decades, deciphering the map of the human heart. This could be in short the plot of The Lowland, the latest by Jhumpa Lahiri. And yet is a lot more than this. Jhumpa Lahiri’s books are never easy. They may seem an easy read on the surface, however a lot of complex emotions seethe underneath and that is just the case with “The Lowland”.

Jhumpa’s writing is not only surreal but also very high on the emotional factor. At the same time it isn’t overdone. The emotions are as subtle as the characters. The writing needs to be spoken more about – it is almost like every sentence had to be written or else the novel would be incomplete.

All one can say is that it is only befitting for her to be on the long and short list of the Booker Prize. If there is one book you must read this year, it has to be this one.


Subhash and Udhayan are brothers who were close as children, but begin to grow apart as they grow older. However, despite the fact that they end up living in two different countries across the globe, their lives are still somehow entwined to each other’s.

The ghosts of Grey’s past constantly tested the affair and although Ana knew the complexity of her ‘fifty shades’ there is no easy way to tackle a fascinating man with repulsive tastes. As she demands more than what Grey wills her to have, they grow apart only to be consumed further into their relationship which now must brave the trials that loving another involves.

Fifty Shades Freed opens with Ana and Grey finally together after the tumultuous affair they shared in the last two books are consummated. Ana is prepared to brave every battle for her part in this relationship but sometimes when fate deals a bad hand, there is really little chance in braving its trials. With Grey acquiring a company called SIP, Ana is still struggling with Christian’s past and his controlling behavior, the couple is battling more than anyone’s fair share of woes.

But there is more to this love affair than meets the eye of any common spectator or reader, as these two young adults believe in the power of their commitment. And this tides them across to better times. Although it might seem that their love survives the perils of life, they are tested yet again and this time, it is much worse than anything that both of them had anticipated, much less prepared for. The plot takes another turn when Mia is kidnapped and held for ransom.

E. L. James delivers a powerful close to the immensely popular trilogy through this book. Fifty Shades Freed engages the themes of past trauma in a most engaging manner in which both Ana and Christian are embroiled in and conflicted with. It was published in 2012 and opened to commercial acclaim.

Harris was looking for ways to transcend the limited results and slow processes involved in conventional psychiatry. He wanted to offer people a unique, accessible, and affordable solution to resolve their life problems. The method of Transactional Analysis (TA), pioneered by Eric Berne, lent itself very well to be that solution.

Transactional Analysis is a psychotherapy model that is based on the idea that adults always carry remnants of emotionally intense childhood experiences. Harris uses this model to link it to the work of a brain surgeon named Wilder Penfield. The latter conducted pioneering experiments to uncover the neurological basis of memory.

Drawing from the work of Berne and Wilder, Harris proceeds to introduce readers to a simplified version of TA or what he calls the Parent, Adult, Child (P-A-C) Model. According to this simplified model, in any given situation, a person switches between one of three psychological states, namely the Parent, the Adult, the Child.

The model further explores how, over the transition from childhood to adulthood, an individual’s opinions take shape, either through conditioning by rules or through his/her own examination of the world around. The book also puts forth a set of four ‘life positions’, any of which an individual assumes depending on a particular situation.

After detailing the P-A-C model, Harris goes on to explain how this model can form the basis for a positive, improved future for any individual, regardless of what has or has not transpired in his/her past. He presents invaluable techniques to help readers achieve mastery over themselves, their relationships, and their future.

I’m OK, You’re OK was first published in 1967. Its popularity soared continuously and it stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for two years. It has been translated into more than twelve languages and has sold more than 15 million copies.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done will teach readers how to master the art of execution by understanding strategy, operations, and how to link people together. These three processes are at the center of every business.

The book clearly points out that top leaders give too much importance to creating a vision, devising strategies, and formulating plans. After doing so, they remove themselves from the picture and delegate tasks to their subordinates. This methodology is frowned upon in this book. Instead, it is recommended that leaders should adopt a hands-on approach. According to the authors, it very important to be passionate and deeply involved in one’s organization. Having robust dialogues about individuals, operations, and strategies, results in a business culture that is based on realism and honesty. Therefore actually “running” a business depends on carrying out these processes and not necessarily having a vision and leaving the responsibility of execution on others.

The authors also maintain that one important job that a leader must execute is choosing and evaluating people. A task that should not be passed on to others. This entails personally checking references for key candidates and ensures that the right people will be selected for the right job. A gene pool with leadership is able to conceive and select strategies for execution that are in alignment with the economy, competition, and marketplace. When the right individual and strategy are selected, an operating procedure is chosen. This results in specific programs getting implemented and assigning accountability. The methodology outlined in this book is effective because it spells out an operating process which transcends the usual way of looking at budget and goals.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done was published in 2011.

The book encompasses examples of superheroes from movies, comics, mythology and history.

The book explores the teachings of religious heroes like Buddha and Jesus, along with the popular comic book and movie heroes like Wolverine and Batman.

The book offers an interesting and different take on the similarities between the struggles of the beloved superheroes and the rest of mankind. Drawing parallels between the internal struggles of the Incredible Hulk and Batman, Chopra explains how the readers can incorporate the laws towards the betterment of their self and the world.

Chopra has tried to project the essential qualities that go into making a superhero. The book explains the never ending battle between good and evil, dark and light. The Law of Balance, The Law of Transformation, The Law of Power, The Law of Love, The Law of Intention and The Law of Transcendence, form the major content of the book. It is a unique attempt at self discovery and spiritualism.

Can decline be detected early and avoided? How far can a company fall before the path toward doom becomes inevitable and unshakable? How can companies reverse course?\n\nIn How the Mighty Fall, Collins confronts these questions, offering leaders the well-founded hope that they can learn how to stave off decline and, if they find themselves falling, reverse their course. Collins? research project?more than four years in duration?uncovered five step-wise stages of decline: \n\nStage 1: Hubris Born of Success\nStage 2: Undisciplined Pursuit of More\nStage 3: Denial of Risk and Peril\nStage 4: Grasping for Salvation\nStage 5: Capitulation to Irrelevance or Death\n\nBy understanding these stages of decline, leaders can substantially reduce their chances of falling all the way to the bottom.\n\nGreat companies can stumble, badly, and recover.\n\nEvery institution, no matter how great, is vulnerable to decline. There is no law of nature that the most powerful will inevitably remain at the top. Anyone can fall and most eventually do. But, as Collins? research emphasizes, some companies do indeed recover?in some cases, coming back even stronger?even after having crashed into the depths of Stage 4.\n\nDecline, it turns out, is largely self-inflicted, and the path to recovery lies largely within our own hands. We are not imprisoned by our circumstances, our history, or even our staggering defeats along the way. As long as we never get entirely knocked out of the game, hope always remains.

So why can we not solve them? According to Edward de Bono, world thinking cannot solve world problems because world thinking is itself the problem. And this is getting worse: we are so accustomed to readily available information online that we search immediately for the answers rather than thinking about them. Our minds function like trying to drive a car using only one wheel. There's nothing wrong with that one wheel - conventional thinking - but we could all get a lot further if we used all four... De Bono examines why we think the way we do from a historical perspective and uses some of his famous thinking techniques combined with new ideas to show us how to change the way we think. If we strengthen our ability and raise our thinking level, other areas of our life - both personal and business success - will improve. De Bono is the master of the original big 'concept' book and his enticement to us to use our minds as constructively as possible should appeal to a whole new generation of fans",Think!

What happens when there is almost unlimited choice? When everything becomes available to everyone? And when the combined value of the millions of items that only sell in small quantities equals or even exceeds the value of a handful of best-sellers?

In this ground-breaking book, Chris Anderson shows that the future of business does not lie in hits - the high-volume end of a traditional demand curve - but in what used to be regarded as misses - the endlessly long tail of that same curve. As our world is transformed by the Internet and the near infinite choice it offers consumers, so traditional business models are being overturned and new truths revealed about what consumers want and how they want to get it.

Chris Anderson first explored the Long Tail in an article in Wired magazine that has become one of the most influential business essays of our time. Now, in this eagerly anticipated book, he takes a closer look at the new economics of the Internet age, showing where business is going and exploring the huge opportunities that exist: for new producers, new e-tailers, and new tastemakers. He demonstrates how long tail economics apply to industries ranging from the toy business to advertising to kitchen appliances. He sets down the rules for operating in a long tail economy. And he provides a glimpse of a future that's already here.",The Long Tail: How Endless Choice is Creating Unlimited Demand,Chris Anderson, , ,Random House,9781847940360,"1st Edition,2009",267,India,English

In Who Moved My Cheese?: An Amazing Way To Deal With Change In Your Work And In Your Life, Spencer Johnson reveals how people can adapt to change in a positive manner. Beginning with an introduction by Kenneth Blanchard, the book reveals the story behind the main story. Johnson, in this book, employs the parable form to give readers insight on change and how to cope with it.

The book narrates the tale of four creatures, two mice and two tiny humans who are on a hunt for cheese. The author encapsulates the four predictable and typical reactions when the cheese is moved. Sniff and Scurry, the mice, and Hem and Haw, the humans, are initially happy with the seemingly unending supply at Cheese Station C, but are discontent when the supply starts getting depleted. Who Moved My Cheese takes this situation and discusses the best ways to react in such a situation. Instead of blaming others or resisting change, Spencer advises the readers to anticipate, monitor, adapt and enjoy the change. This short tale reminds readers that change should not hinder progress.

This tale of the four characters in the maze is similar to that of all the people who are hunting for good jobs, money, stable relationships and success. Spencer Johnson shows us how we can successfully deal with the inevitable changes in life. First published in 1998, the book has remained popular among readers of all ages. The book was on the New York Times business bestseller list for five years and has sold over 26 million copies and translated to many languages.

In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us into the thrilling and surprising world of the scientific study of habits.
He examines why some people and companies struggle to change,
despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. He visits laboratories where neuroscientists explore how
habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. And he uncovers how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and
civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr.
The result is a compelling argument and an empowering discovery: the key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive or even building revolutionary companies is understanding how habits work. By harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities,
and our lives.

How do you go about it? Billions of government dollars, and thousands of charitable organizations and NGOs, are dedicated to helping the worlds poor. But much of their work is based on assumptions about the poor and the world that are untested generalizations at best, harmful misperceptions at worst.

Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo have pioneered the use of randomized control trials (RCTs) in development economics through their award-winning Poverty Action Lab. They argue that by using RCTs and, more generally, by paying careful attention to the evidence, it is possible to make accurate and often startling assessments on what really impacts the poor and what doesnt.

Revelatory and impassioned, Poor Economics is a pathbreaking book that will help you to understand the real causes of poverty and how to end it.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life explores the history of human efforts to unravel the puzzles of the Universe. It starts with the Greeks. Particularly the Ionian Greeks and their contention that the the Universe had to have a cause based on the laws of science.

It covers landmark discoveries, like that of Copernicus who showed that the Earth was not the center of the Universe. It explains the various laws of physics that have provided answers to so many things that have puzzled people for long. The authors show that the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Physics have together helped humans understand many of the deep mysteries about the Universe. But the quest to find a single theory, a unified theory that will explain everything about everything has been elusive.

This Theory of Everything was a dream of Einstein, and other scientists have continued the quest. The Theory of Everything has had several candidates, and the latest is the M-Theory which the authors present as the most likely solution. They contend that the new discoveries make God unnecessary. They say that the laws of physics show that the Universe is a result of spontaneous creation.

They also explore the M-Theory further and explain that just like ours is not the only galaxy in the Universe, our Universe is not the only one out there. In fact, there might be one universe for each possible outcome of a situation, so the Universe that a person sees is a perception of reality from their viewpoint. They also propose that these universes could be so vastly different, some may not be capable of supporting life forms.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life is an intriguing exploration of all the discoveries that revealed the secrets of the Universe, and where science could proceed from now. It explains how physics could soon provide the ultimate answers to all the mysteries of the Universe.

Smith's seminal work, The Wealth of Nations, aims to create a new understanding of economics. Smith writes largely against the mercantile system that existed at the time of writing, but, along the way, gives a complicated but brilliant account of an economic system based in human nature and deeply rooted social dynamics. The text is characterized by fact-heavy digressions, tables, and appendices that blend hard research with broad generalities, demonstrating his commitment to give evidence for what seem like timeless observations about the nature of economics.

Books I and II focus on developing the idea of the division of labor, and describing how this division adds to the opulence of a given society by creating enormous surpluses, which can be exchanged among members. The division of labor also fuels technological innovation, by giving intense focus to certain tasks, and allowing workers to brainstorm ways to make these tasks more efficient. This, again, adds to efficiency and grows surpluses. Surpluses, Smith writes, may be either traded or re-invested. In the latter case, technologies are likely to improve, leading to even greater efficiencies.

Book III considers Great Britain in the context of the the social evolution of society in general, which begins, according to Smith, with hunting and gathering societies and progresses through agricultural stages to arrive at a state of international commerce. According to Smith, the fall of Rome and the rise of feudalism retarded this progression by creating a system of decreased efficiency.

Book IV goes on to criticize the “mercantile commerce” that characterized much of Smith's Europe. Smith's first major criticism of mercantilism is that it conflates value and wealth with precious metals. According to Smith, the real measure of the wealth of a nation is the stream of goods and services that the nation creates. In making this point, Smith invents the idea of gross domestic product, which has become central to modern economics. The wealth of a nation is increased not by hoarding metals, but by increasing the productive capacity by expanding the market—by increasing trade.

An important theme that persists throughout the work is the idea that the economic system is automatic, and, when left with substantial freedom, able to regulate itself. This is often referred to as the “invisible hand.” The ability to self-regulate and to ensure maximum efficiency, however, is threatened by monopolies, tax preferences, lobbying groups, and other “privileges” extended to certain members of the economy at the expense of others.

Finally, in the last book of The Wealth of Nations, Smith describes what he considers to be the appropriate roles of government, namely defense, justice, the creation and maintenance of public works that contribute to commerce, education, the maintenance of the “dignity of the sovereign,”—activities that are to be financed by fair and clear taxation.

He alone wants to break free, and his only escape might be to go to one of the few remaining Savage Reservations, where the old way of life still survives. But is this imperfect life really what Marx wants or is it just his quest to find a cure for his distress? This is Aldous Huxley’s most famous novel, and considered to be the definitive dystopian novel.

Different ideologies. A love story. A country’s movement and lives spanning over decades, deciphering the map of the human heart. This could be in short the plot of The Lowland, the latest by Jhumpa Lahiri. And yet is a lot more than this. Jhumpa Lahiri’s books are never easy. They may seem an easy read on the surface, however a lot of complex emotions seethe underneath and that is just the case with “The Lowland”.

Jhumpa’s writing is not only surreal but also very high on the emotional factor. At the same time it isn’t overdone. The emotions are as subtle as the characters. The writing needs to be spoken more about – it is almost like every sentence had to be written or else the novel would be incomplete.

All one can say is that it is only befitting for her to be on the long and short list of the Booker Prize. If there is one book you must read this year, it has to be this one.


Subhash and Udhayan are brothers who were close as children, but begin to grow apart as they grow older. However, despite the fact that they end up living in two different countries across the globe, their lives are still somehow entwined to each other’s.

The ghosts of Grey’s past constantly tested the affair and although Ana knew the complexity of her ‘fifty shades’ there is no easy way to tackle a fascinating man with repulsive tastes. As she demands more than what Grey wills her to have, they grow apart only to be consumed further into their relationship which now must brave the trials that loving another involves.

Fifty Shades Freed opens with Ana and Grey finally together after the tumultuous affair they shared in the last two books are consummated. Ana is prepared to brave every battle for her part in this relationship but sometimes when fate deals a bad hand, there is really little chance in braving its trials. With Grey acquiring a company called SIP, Ana is still struggling with Christian’s past and his controlling behavior, the couple is battling more than anyone’s fair share of woes.

But there is more to this love affair than meets the eye of any common spectator or reader, as these two young adults believe in the power of their commitment. And this tides them across to better times. Although it might seem that their love survives the perils of life, they are tested yet again and this time, it is much worse than anything that both of them had anticipated, much less prepared for. The plot takes another turn when Mia is kidnapped and held for ransom.

E. L. James delivers a powerful close to the immensely popular trilogy through this book. Fifty Shades Freed engages the themes of past trauma in a most engaging manner in which both Ana and Christian are embroiled in and conflicted with. It was published in 2012 and opened to commercial acclaim.

Harris was looking for ways to transcend the limited results and slow processes involved in conventional psychiatry. He wanted to offer people a unique, accessible, and affordable solution to resolve their life problems. The method of Transactional Analysis (TA), pioneered by Eric Berne, lent itself very well to be that solution.

Transactional Analysis is a psychotherapy model that is based on the idea that adults always carry remnants of emotionally intense childhood experiences. Harris uses this model to link it to the work of a brain surgeon named Wilder Penfield. The latter conducted pioneering experiments to uncover the neurological basis of memory.

Drawing from the work of Berne and Wilder, Harris proceeds to introduce readers to a simplified version of TA or what he calls the Parent, Adult, Child (P-A-C) Model. According to this simplified model, in any given situation, a person switches between one of three psychological states, namely the Parent, the Adult, the Child.

The model further explores how, over the transition from childhood to adulthood, an individual’s opinions take shape, either through conditioning by rules or through his/her own examination of the world around. The book also puts forth a set of four ‘life positions’, any of which an individual assumes depending on a particular situation.

After detailing the P-A-C model, Harris goes on to explain how this model can form the basis for a positive, improved future for any individual, regardless of what has or has not transpired in his/her past. He presents invaluable techniques to help readers achieve mastery over themselves, their relationships, and their future.

I’m OK, You’re OK was first published in 1967. Its popularity soared continuously and it stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for two years. It has been translated into more than twelve languages and has sold more than 15 million copies.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done will teach readers how to master the art of execution by understanding strategy, operations, and how to link people together. These three processes are at the center of every business.

The book clearly points out that top leaders give too much importance to creating a vision, devising strategies, and formulating plans. After doing so, they remove themselves from the picture and delegate tasks to their subordinates. This methodology is frowned upon in this book. Instead, it is recommended that leaders should adopt a hands-on approach. According to the authors, it very important to be passionate and deeply involved in one’s organization. Having robust dialogues about individuals, operations, and strategies, results in a business culture that is based on realism and honesty. Therefore actually “running” a business depends on carrying out these processes and not necessarily having a vision and leaving the responsibility of execution on others.

The authors also maintain that one important job that a leader must execute is choosing and evaluating people. A task that should not be passed on to others. This entails personally checking references for key candidates and ensures that the right people will be selected for the right job. A gene pool with leadership is able to conceive and select strategies for execution that are in alignment with the economy, competition, and marketplace. When the right individual and strategy are selected, an operating procedure is chosen. This results in specific programs getting implemented and assigning accountability. The methodology outlined in this book is effective because it spells out an operating process which transcends the usual way of looking at budget and goals.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done was published in 2011.

The book encompasses examples of superheroes from movies, comics, mythology and history.

The book explores the teachings of religious heroes like Buddha and Jesus, along with the popular comic book and movie heroes like Wolverine and Batman.

The book offers an interesting and different take on the similarities between the struggles of the beloved superheroes and the rest of mankind. Drawing parallels between the internal struggles of the Incredible Hulk and Batman, Chopra explains how the readers can incorporate the laws towards the betterment of their self and the world.

Chopra has tried to project the essential qualities that go into making a superhero. The book explains the never ending battle between good and evil, dark and light. The Law of Balance, The Law of Transformation, The Law of Power, The Law of Love, The Law of Intention and The Law of Transcendence, form the major content of the book. It is a unique attempt at self discovery and spiritualism.

Can decline be detected early and avoided? How far can a company fall before the path toward doom becomes inevitable and unshakable? How can companies reverse course?\n\nIn How the Mighty Fall, Collins confronts these questions, offering leaders the well-founded hope that they can learn how to stave off decline and, if they find themselves falling, reverse their course. Collins? research project?more than four years in duration?uncovered five step-wise stages of decline: \n\nStage 1: Hubris Born of Success\nStage 2: Undisciplined Pursuit of More\nStage 3: Denial of Risk and Peril\nStage 4: Grasping for Salvation\nStage 5: Capitulation to Irrelevance or Death\n\nBy understanding these stages of decline, leaders can substantially reduce their chances of falling all the way to the bottom.\n\nGreat companies can stumble, badly, and recover.\n\nEvery institution, no matter how great, is vulnerable to decline. There is no law of nature that the most powerful will inevitably remain at the top. Anyone can fall and most eventually do.

Our minds function like trying to drive a car using only one wheel. There's nothing wrong with that one wheel - conventional thinking - but we could all get a lot further if we used all four... De Bono examines why we think the way we do from a historical perspective and uses some of his famous thinking techniques combined with new ideas to show us how to change the way we think. If we strengthen our ability and raise our thinking level, other areas of our life - both personal and business success - will improve. De Bono is the master of the original big 'concept' book and his enticement to us to use our minds as constructively as possible should appeal to a whole new generation of fans",Think!

Shirer provides personal insights into how absolute dictatorship was formed in Germany. There are extensive references made to all the sources which may or may not be speculative.

On publication in 1960, The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich sold over one million copies worldwide. This book won the National Book Award for Nonfiction in 1961. The Reader’s Digest in 1962 reported that there were over 12 million readers of this book.

What happens when there is almost unlimited choice? When everything becomes available to everyone? And when the combined value of the millions of items that only sell in small quantities equals or even exceeds the value of a handful of best-sellers?

In this ground-breaking book, Chris Anderson shows that the future of business does not lie in hits - the high-volume end of a traditional demand curve - but in what used to be regarded as misses - the endlessly long tail of that same curve. As our world is transformed by the Internet and the near infinite choice it offers consumers, so traditional business models are being overturned and new truths revealed about what consumers want and how they want to get it.

Chris Anderson first explored the Long Tail in an article in Wired magazine that has become one of the most influential business essays of our time. Now, in this eagerly anticipated book, he takes a closer look at the new economics of the Internet age, showing where business is going and exploring the huge opportunities that exist: for new producers, new e-tailers, and new tastemakers. He demonstrates how long tail economics apply to industries ranging from the toy business to advertising to kitchen appliances. He sets down the rules for operating in a long tail economy. And he provides a glimpse of a future that's already here.",The Long Tail: How Endless Choice is Creating Unlimited Demand,Chris Anderson, , ,Random House,9781847940360,"1st Edition,2009",267,India,English

The book narrates the tale of four creatures, two mice and two tiny humans who are on a hunt for cheese. The author encapsulates the four predictable and typical reactions when the cheese is moved. Sniff and Scurry, the mice, and Hem and Haw, the humans, are initially happy with the seemingly unending supply at Cheese Station C, but are discontent when the supply starts getting depleted. Who Moved My Cheese takes this situation and discusses the best ways to react in such a situation. Instead of blaming others or resisting change, Spencer advises the readers to anticipate, monitor, adapt and enjoy the change. This short tale reminds readers that change should not hinder progress.

This tale of the four characters in the maze is similar to that of all the people who are hunting for good jobs, money, stable relationships and success. Spencer Johnson shows us how we can successfully deal with the inevitable changes in life. First published in 1998, the book has remained popular among readers of all ages. The book was on the New York Times business bestseller list for five years and has sold over 26 million copies and translated to many languages.

In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us into the thrilling and surprising world of the scientific study of habits.
He examines why some people and companies struggle to change,
despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. He visits laboratories where neuroscientists explore how
habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. And he uncovers how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and
civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr.
The result is a compelling argument and an empowering discovery: the key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive or even building revolutionary companies is understanding how habits work. By harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities,
and our lives.

How do you go about it? Billions of government dollars, and thousands of charitable organizations and NGOs, are dedicated to helping the worlds poor.

Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo have pioneered the use of randomized control trials (RCTs) in development economics through their award-winning Poverty Action Lab. They argue that by using RCTs and, more generally, by paying careful attention to the evidence, it is possible to make accurate and often startling assessments on what really impacts the poor and what doesnt.

Revelatory and impassioned, Poor Economics is a pathbreaking book that will help you to understand the real causes of poverty and how to end it.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life explores the history of human efforts to unravel the puzzles of the Universe. It starts with the Greeks. Particularly the Ionian Greeks and their contention that the the Universe had to have a cause based on the laws of science.

It covers landmark discoveries, like that of Copernicus who showed that the Earth was not the center of the Universe. It explains the various laws of physics that have provided answers to so many things that have puzzled people for long. The authors show that the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Physics have together helped humans understand many of the deep mysteries about the Universe. But the quest to find a single theory, a unified theory that will explain everything about everything has been elusive.

This Theory of Everything was a dream of Einstein, and other scientists have continued the quest. The Theory of Everything has had several candidates, and the latest is the M-Theory which the authors present as the most likely solution. They contend that the new discoveries make God unnecessary. They say that the laws of physics show that the Universe is a result of spontaneous creation.

They also explore the M-Theory further and explain that just like ours is not the only galaxy in the Universe, our Universe is not the only one out there. In fact, there might be one universe for each possible outcome of a situation, so the Universe that a person sees is a perception of reality from their viewpoint. They also propose that these universes could be so vastly different, some may not be capable of supporting life forms.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life is an intriguing exploration of all the discoveries that revealed the secrets of the Universe, and where science could proceed from now. It explains how physics could soon provide the ultimate answers to all the mysteries of the Universe.

Smith's seminal work, The Wealth of Nations, aims to create a new understanding of economics. Smith writes largely against the mercantile system that existed at the time of writing, but, along the way, gives a complicated but brilliant account of an economic system based in human nature and deeply rooted social dynamics. The text is characterized by fact-heavy digressions, tables, and appendices that blend hard research with broad generalities, demonstrating his commitment to give evidence for what seem like timeless observations about the nature of economics.

Books I and II focus on developing the idea of the division of labor, and describing how this division adds to the opulence of a given society by creating enormous surpluses, which can be exchanged among members. The division of labor also fuels technological innovation, by giving intense focus to certain tasks, and allowing workers to brainstorm ways to make these tasks more efficient. This, again, adds to efficiency and grows surpluses. Surpluses, Smith writes, may be either traded or re-invested. In the latter case, technologies are likely to improve, leading to even greater efficiencies.

Book III considers Great Britain in the context of the the social evolution of society in general, which begins, according to Smith, with hunting and gathering societies and progresses through agricultural stages to arrive at a state of international commerce. According to Smith, the fall of Rome and the rise of feudalism retarded this progression by creating a system of decreased efficiency.

Book IV goes on to criticize the “mercantile commerce” that characterized much of Smith's Europe. Smith's first major criticism of mercantilism is that it conflates value and wealth with precious metals. According to Smith, the real measure of the wealth of a nation is the stream of goods and services that the nation creates. In making this point, Smith invents the idea of gross domestic product, which has become central to modern economics. The wealth of a nation is increased not by hoarding metals, but by increasing the productive capacity by expanding the market—by increasing trade.

An important theme that persists throughout the work is the idea that the economic system is automatic, and, when left with substantial freedom, able to regulate itself. This is often referred to as the “invisible hand.” The ability to self-regulate and to ensure maximum efficiency, however, is threatened by monopolies, tax preferences, lobbying groups, and other “privileges” extended to certain members of the economy at the expense of others.

Finally, in the last book of The Wealth of Nations, Smith describes what he considers to be the appropriate roles of government, namely defense, justice, the creation and maintenance of public works that contribute to commerce, education, the maintenance of the “dignity of the sovereign,”—activities that are to be financed by fair and clear taxation.

Different ideologies. A love story. A country’s movement and lives spanning over decades, deciphering the map of the human heart. This could be in short the plot of The Lowland, the latest by Jhumpa Lahiri. And yet is a lot more than this. Jhumpa Lahiri’s books are never easy. They may seem an easy read on the surface, however a lot of complex emotions seethe underneath and that is just the case with “The Lowland”.

Jhumpa’s writing is not only surreal but also very high on the emotional factor. At the same time it isn’t overdone. The emotions are as subtle as the characters. The writing needs to be spoken more about – it is almost like every sentence had to be written or else the novel would be incomplete.

All one can say is that it is only befitting for her to be on the long and short list of the Booker Prize. If there is one book you must read this year, it has to be this one.

The ghosts of Grey’s past constantly tested the affair and although Ana knew the complexity of her ‘fifty shades’ there is no easy way to tackle a fascinating man with repulsive tastes. As she demands more than what Grey wills her to have, they grow apart only to be consumed further into their relationship which now must brave the trials that loving another involves.

Fifty Shades Freed opens with Ana and Grey finally together after the tumultuous affair they shared in the last two books are consummated. Ana is prepared to brave every battle for her part in this relationship but sometimes when fate deals a bad hand, there is really little chance in braving its trials. With Grey acquiring a company called SIP, Ana is still struggling with Christian’s past and his controlling behavior, the couple is battling more than anyone’s fair share of woes.

But there is more to this love affair than meets the eye of any common spectator or reader, as these two young adults believe in the power of their commitment. And this tides them across to better times. Although it might seem that their love survives the perils of life, they are tested yet again and this time, it is much worse than anything that both of them had anticipated, much less prepared for. The plot takes another turn when Mia is kidnapped and held for ransom.

E. L. James delivers a powerful close to the immensely popular trilogy through this book. Fifty Shades Freed engages the themes of past trauma in a most engaging manner in which both Ana and Christian are embroiled in and conflicted with. It was published in 2012 and opened to commercial acclaim.

Harris was looking for ways to transcend the limited results and slow processes involved in conventional psychiatry. He wanted to offer people a unique, accessible, and affordable solution to resolve their life problems. The method of Transactional Analysis (TA), pioneered by Eric Berne, lent itself very well to be that solution.

Transactional Analysis is a psychotherapy model that is based on the idea that adults always carry remnants of emotionally intense childhood experiences. Harris uses this model to link it to the work of a brain surgeon named Wilder Penfield. The latter conducted pioneering experiments to uncover the neurological basis of memory.

Drawing from the work of Berne and Wilder, Harris proceeds to introduce readers to a simplified version of TA or what he calls the Parent, Adult, Child (P-A-C) Model. According to this simplified model, in any given situation, a person switches between one of three psychological states, namely the Parent, the Adult, the Child.

The model further explores how, over the transition from childhood to adulthood, an individual’s opinions take shape, either through conditioning by rules or through his/her own examination of the world around. The book also puts forth a set of four ‘life positions’, any of which an individual assumes depending on a particular situation.

After detailing the P-A-C model, Harris goes on to explain how this model can form the basis for a positive, improved future for any individual, regardless of what has or has not transpired in his/her past. He presents invaluable techniques to help readers achieve mastery over themselves, their relationships, and their future.

I’m OK, You’re OK was first published in 1967. Its popularity soared continuously and it stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for two years. It has been translated into more than twelve languages and has sold more than 15 million copies.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done will teach readers how to master the art of execution by understanding strategy, operations, and how to link people together. These three processes are at the center of every business.

The book clearly points out that top leaders give too much importance to creating a vision, devising strategies, and formulating plans. After doing so, they remove themselves from the picture and delegate tasks to their subordinates. This methodology is frowned upon in this book. Instead, it is recommended that leaders should adopt a hands-on approach. According to the authors, it very important to be passionate and deeply involved in one’s organization. Having robust dialogues about individuals, operations, and strategies, results in a business culture that is based on realism and honesty. Therefore actually “running” a business depends on carrying out these processes and not necessarily having a vision and leaving the responsibility of execution on others.

The authors also maintain that one important job that a leader must execute is choosing and evaluating people. A task that should not be passed on to others. This entails personally checking references for key candidates and ensures that the right people will be selected for the right job. A gene pool with leadership is able to conceive and select strategies for execution that are in alignment with the economy, competition, and marketplace. When the right individual and strategy are selected, an operating procedure is chosen. This results in specific programs getting implemented and assigning accountability. The methodology outlined in this book is effective because it spells out an operating process which transcends the usual way of looking at budget and goals.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done was published in 2011.

The book offers an interesting and different take on the similarities between the struggles of the beloved superheroes and the rest of mankind. Drawing parallels between the internal struggles of the Incredible Hulk and Batman, Chopra explains how the readers can incorporate the laws towards the betterment of their self and the world.

Chopra has tried to project the essential qualities that go into making a superhero. The book explains the never ending battle between good and evil, dark and light. The Law of Balance, The Law of Transformation, The Law of Power, The Law of Love, The Law of Intention and The Law of Transcendence, form the major content of the book. It is a unique attempt at self discovery and spiritualism.

Can decline be detected early and avoided? How far can a company fall before the path toward doom becomes inevitable and unshakable? How can companies reverse course?\n\nIn How the Mighty Fall, Collins confronts these questions, offering leaders the well-founded hope that they can learn how to stave off decline and, if they find themselves falling, reverse their course. Collins? research project?more than four years in duration?uncovered five step-wise stages of decline: \n\nStage 1: Hubris Born of Success\nStage 2: Undisciplined Pursuit of More\nStage 3: Denial of Risk and Peril\nStage 4: Grasping for Salvation\nStage 5: Capitulation to Irrelevance or Death\n\nBy understanding these stages of decline, leaders can substantially reduce their chances of falling all the way to the bottom.\n\nGreat companies can stumble, badly, and recover.\n\nEvery institution, no matter how great, is vulnerable to decline.

This book also provides testimonies from the reports of the British Foreign Office, the Nuremberg trials, and other newspaper reports on the Third Reich. Despite the censorship laws imposed on CBS Radio and the United Press International, the author manages to get hold of these accounts and details them in this work.

The author does not merely report but provides his own take of the Nazi era which ranges from Martin Luther’s revolution to Adolf Hitler’s rise in political power. Shirer provides personal insights into how absolute dictatorship was formed in Germany. There are extensive references made to all the sources which may or may not be speculative.

On publication in 1960, The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich sold over one million copies worldwide. This book won the National Book Award for Nonfiction in 1961. The Reader’s Digest in 1962 reported that there were over 12 million readers of this book. This work was well praised for its journalistic approach in exposing the internal policies and discrepancies of the Nazi regime.

What happens when there is almost unlimited choice? When everything becomes available to everyone? And when the combined value of the millions of items that only sell in small quantities equals or even exceeds the value of a handful of best-sellers?

In this ground-breaking book, Chris Anderson shows that the future of business does not lie in hits - the high-volume end of a traditional demand curve - but in what used to be regarded as misses - the endlessly long tail of that same curve. As our world is transformed by the Internet and the near infinite choice it offers consumers, so traditional business models are being overturned and new truths revealed about what consumers want and how they want to get it.

Chris Anderson first explored the Long Tail in an article in Wired magazine that has become one of the most influential business essays of our time. Now, in this eagerly anticipated book, he takes a closer look at the new economics of the Internet age, showing where business is going and exploring the huge opportunities that exist: for new producers, new e-tailers, and new tastemakers. He demonstrates how long tail economics apply to industries ranging from the toy business to advertising to kitchen appliances. He sets down the rules for operating in a long tail economy. And he provides a glimpse of a future that's already here.",The Long Tail: How Endless Choice is Creating Unlimited Demand,Chris Anderson, , ,Random House,9781847940360,"1st Edition,2009",267,India,English

In Who Moved My Cheese?: An Amazing Way To Deal With Change In Your Work And In Your Life, Spencer Johnson reveals how people can adapt to change in a positive manner. Beginning with an introduction by Kenneth Blanchard, the book reveals the story behind the main story. Johnson, in this book, employs the parable form to give readers insight on change and how to cope with it.

The book narrates the tale of four creatures, two mice and two tiny humans who are on a hunt for cheese. The author encapsulates the four predictable and typical reactions when the cheese is moved. Sniff and Scurry, the mice, and Hem and Haw, the humans, are initially happy with the seemingly unending supply at Cheese Station C, but are discontent when the supply starts getting depleted. Who Moved My Cheese takes this situation and discusses the best ways to react in such a situation. Instead of blaming others or resisting change, Spencer advises the readers to anticipate, monitor, adapt and enjoy the change. This short tale reminds readers that change should not hinder progress.

This tale of the four characters in the maze is similar to that of all the people who are hunting for good jobs, money, stable relationships and success. Spencer Johnson shows us how we can successfully deal with the inevitable changes in life. First published in 1998, the book has remained popular among readers of all ages.

In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us into the thrilling and surprising world of the scientific study of habits.
He examines why some people and companies struggle to change,
despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. He visits laboratories where neuroscientists explore how
habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. And he uncovers how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and
civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr.
The result is a compelling argument and an empowering discovery: the key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive or even building revolutionary companies is understanding how habits work. By harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities,
and our lives.

How do you go about it? Billions of government dollars, and thousands of charitable organizations and NGOs, are dedicated to helping the worlds poor. But much of their work is based on assumptions about the poor and the world that are untested generalizations at best, harmful misperceptions at worst.

Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo have pioneered the use of randomized control trials (RCTs) in development economics through their award-winning Poverty Action Lab. They argue that by using RCTs and, more generally, by paying careful attention to the evidence, it is possible to make accurate and often startling assessments on what really impacts the poor and what doesnt.

Revelatory and impassioned, Poor Economics is a pathbreaking book that will help you to understand the real causes of poverty and how to end it.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life explores the history of human efforts to unravel the puzzles of the Universe. It starts with the Greeks. Particularly the Ionian Greeks and their contention that the the Universe had to have a cause based on the laws of science.

It covers landmark discoveries, like that of Copernicus who showed that the Earth was not the center of the Universe. It explains the various laws of physics that have provided answers to so many things that have puzzled people for long. The authors show that the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Physics have together helped humans understand many of the deep mysteries about the Universe. But the quest to find a single theory, a unified theory that will explain everything about everything has been elusive.

This Theory of Everything was a dream of Einstein, and other scientists have continued the quest. The Theory of Everything has had several candidates, and the latest is the M-Theory which the authors present as the most likely solution. They contend that the new discoveries make God unnecessary. They say that the laws of physics show that the Universe is a result of spontaneous creation.

They also explore the M-Theory further and explain that just like ours is not the only galaxy in the Universe, our Universe is not the only one out there. In fact, there might be one universe for each possible outcome of a situation, so the Universe that a person sees is a perception of reality from their viewpoint. They also propose that these universes could be so vastly different, some may not be capable of supporting life forms.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life is an intriguing exploration of all the discoveries that revealed the secrets of the Universe, and where science could proceed from now. It explains how physics could soon provide the ultimate answers to all the mysteries of the Universe.

This book does not merely iterate the biographic details of the life led. The author emphasizes the pain, the emotions, and the jubilation he felt at every challenge he faced and eventually overcame.

Smith's seminal work, The Wealth of Nations, aims to create a new understanding of economics. Smith writes largely against the mercantile system that existed at the time of writing, but, along the way, gives a complicated but brilliant account of an economic system based in human nature and deeply rooted social dynamics. The text is characterized by fact-heavy digressions, tables, and appendices that blend hard research with broad generalities, demonstrating his commitment to give evidence for what seem like timeless observations about the nature of economics.

Books I and II focus on developing the idea of the division of labor, and describing how this division adds to the opulence of a given society by creating enormous surpluses, which can be exchanged among members. The division of labor also fuels technological innovation, by giving intense focus to certain tasks, and allowing workers to brainstorm ways to make these tasks more efficient. This, again, adds to efficiency and grows surpluses. Surpluses, Smith writes, may be either traded or re-invested. In the latter case, technologies are likely to improve, leading to even greater efficiencies.

Book III considers Great Britain in the context of the the social evolution of society in general, which begins, according to Smith, with hunting and gathering societies and progresses through agricultural stages to arrive at a state of international commerce. According to Smith, the fall of Rome and the rise of feudalism retarded this progression by creating a system of decreased efficiency.

Book IV goes on to criticize the “mercantile commerce” that characterized much of Smith's Europe. Smith's first major criticism of mercantilism is that it conflates value and wealth with precious metals. According to Smith, the real measure of the wealth of a nation is the stream of goods and services that the nation creates. In making this point, Smith invents the idea of gross domestic product, which has become central to modern economics. The wealth of a nation is increased not by hoarding metals, but by increasing the productive capacity by expanding the market—by increasing trade.

An important theme that persists throughout the work is the idea that the economic system is automatic, and, when left with substantial freedom, able to regulate itself. This is often referred to as the “invisible hand.” The ability to self-regulate and to ensure maximum efficiency, however, is threatened by monopolies, tax preferences, lobbying groups, and other “privileges” extended to certain members of the economy at the expense of others.

Finally, in the last book of The Wealth of Nations, Smith describes what he considers to be the appropriate roles of government, namely defense, justice, the creation and maintenance of public works that contribute to commerce, education, the maintenance of the “dignity of the sovereign,”—activities that are to be financed by fair and clear taxation.

Different ideologies. A love story. A country’s movement and lives spanning over decades, deciphering the map of the human heart. This could be in short the plot of The Lowland, the latest by Jhumpa Lahiri. And yet is a lot more than this. Jhumpa Lahiri’s books are never easy. They may seem an easy read on the surface, however a lot of complex emotions seethe underneath and that is just the case with “The Lowland”.

Jhumpa’s writing is not only surreal but also very high on the emotional factor. At the same time it isn’t overdone. The emotions are as subtle as the characters. The writing needs to be spoken more about – it is almost like every sentence had to be written or else the novel would be incomplete.

All one can say is that it is only befitting for her to be on the long and short list of the Booker Prize. If there is one book you must read this year, it has to be this one.

The ghosts of Grey’s past constantly tested the affair and although Ana knew the complexity of her ‘fifty shades’ there is no easy way to tackle a fascinating man with repulsive tastes. As she demands more than what Grey wills her to have, they grow apart only to be consumed further into their relationship which now must brave the trials that loving another involves.

Fifty Shades Freed opens with Ana and Grey finally together after the tumultuous affair they shared in the last two books are consummated. Ana is prepared to brave every battle for her part in this relationship but sometimes when fate deals a bad hand, there is really little chance in braving its trials. With Grey acquiring a company called SIP, Ana is still struggling with Christian’s past and his controlling behavior, the couple is battling more than anyone’s fair share of woes.

But there is more to this love affair than meets the eye of any common spectator or reader, as these two young adults believe in the power of their commitment. And this tides them across to better times. Although it might seem that their love survives the perils of life, they are tested yet again and this time, it is much worse than anything that both of them had anticipated, much less prepared for. The plot takes another turn when Mia is kidnapped and held for ransom.

E. L. James delivers a powerful close to the immensely popular trilogy through this book. Fifty Shades Freed engages the themes of past trauma in a most engaging manner in which both Ana and Christian are embroiled in and conflicted with. It was published in 2012 and opened to commercial acclaim.

Harris was looking for ways to transcend the limited results and slow processes involved in conventional psychiatry. He wanted to offer people a unique, accessible, and affordable solution to resolve their life problems. The method of Transactional Analysis (TA), pioneered by Eric Berne, lent itself very well to be that solution.

Transactional Analysis is a psychotherapy model that is based on the idea that adults always carry remnants of emotionally intense childhood experiences. Harris uses this model to link it to the work of a brain surgeon named Wilder Penfield. The latter conducted pioneering experiments to uncover the neurological basis of memory.

Drawing from the work of Berne and Wilder, Harris proceeds to introduce readers to a simplified version of TA or what he calls the Parent, Adult, Child (P-A-C) Model. According to this simplified model, in any given situation, a person switches between one of three psychological states, namely the Parent, the Adult, the Child.

The model further explores how, over the transition from childhood to adulthood, an individual’s opinions take shape, either through conditioning by rules or through his/her own examination of the world around. The book also puts forth a set of four ‘life positions’, any of which an individual assumes depending on a particular situation.

After detailing the P-A-C model, Harris goes on to explain how this model can form the basis for a positive, improved future for any individual, regardless of what has or has not transpired in his/her past. He presents invaluable techniques to help readers achieve mastery over themselves, their relationships, and their future.

I’m OK, You’re OK was first published in 1967. Its popularity soared continuously and it stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for two years. It has been translated into more than twelve languages and has sold more than 15 million copies.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done will teach readers how to master the art of execution by understanding strategy, operations, and how to link people together. These three processes are at the center of every business.

The book clearly points out that top leaders give too much importance to creating a vision, devising strategies, and formulating plans. After doing so, they remove themselves from the picture and delegate tasks to their subordinates. This methodology is frowned upon in this book. Instead, it is recommended that leaders should adopt a hands-on approach. According to the authors, it very important to be passionate and deeply involved in one’s organization. Having robust dialogues about individuals, operations, and strategies, results in a business culture that is based on realism and honesty. Therefore actually “running” a business depends on carrying out these processes and not necessarily having a vision and leaving the responsibility of execution on others.

The authors also maintain that one important job that a leader must execute is choosing and evaluating people. A task that should not be passed on to others. This entails personally checking references for key candidates and ensures that the right people will be selected for the right job. A gene pool with leadership is able to conceive and select strategies for execution that are in alignment with the economy, competition, and marketplace. When the right individual and strategy are selected, an operating procedure is chosen. This results in specific programs getting implemented and assigning accountability. The methodology outlined in this book is effective because it spells out an operating process which transcends the usual way of looking at budget and goals.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done was published in 2011.

Can decline be detected early and avoided? How far can a company fall before the path toward doom becomes inevitable and unshakable? How can companies reverse course?\n\nIn How the Mighty Fall, Collins confronts these questions, offering leaders the well-founded hope that they can learn how to stave off decline and, if they find themselves falling, reverse their course. Collins? research project?more than four years in duration?uncovered five step-wise stages of decline: \n\nStage 1: Hubris Born of Success\nStage 2: Undisciplined Pursuit of More\nStage 3: Denial of Risk and Peril\nStage 4: Grasping for Salvation\nStage 5: Capitulation to Irrelevance or Death\n\nBy understanding these stages of decline, leaders can substantially reduce their chances of falling all the way to the bottom.\n\nGreat companies can stumble, badly, and recover.\n\nEvery institution, no matter how great, is vulnerable to decline.

Despite the censorship laws imposed on CBS Radio and the United Press International, the author manages to get hold of these accounts and details them in this work.

The author does not merely report but provides his own take of the Nazi era which ranges from Martin Luther’s revolution to Adolf Hitler’s rise in political power. Shirer provides personal insights into how absolute dictatorship was formed in Germany. There are extensive references made to all the sources which may or may not be speculative.

On publication in 1960, The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich sold over one million copies worldwide. This book won the National Book Award for Nonfiction in 1961. The Reader’s Digest in 1962 reported that there were over 12 million readers of this book. This work was well praised for its journalistic approach in exposing the internal policies and discrepancies of the Nazi regime.

Noah disembarks from his ark but he and his Voyage are not forgotten: they are revisited in on other centuries and other climes - by a Victorian spinster mourning her father, by an American astronaut on an obsessive personal mission. We journey to the Titanic, to the Amazon, to the raft of the Medusa, and to an ecclesiastical court in medieval France where a bizarre case is about to begin...

What happens when there is almost unlimited choice? When everything becomes available to everyone? And when the combined value of the millions of items that only sell in small quantities equals or even exceeds the value of a handful of best-sellers?

In this ground-breaking book, Chris Anderson shows that the future of business does not lie in hits - the high-volume end of a traditional demand curve - but in what used to be regarded as misses - the endlessly long tail of that same curve. As our world is transformed by the Internet and the near infinite choice it offers consumers, so traditional business models are being overturned and new truths revealed about what consumers want and how they want to get it.

Chris Anderson first explored the Long Tail in an article in Wired magazine that has become one of the most influential business essays of our time. Now, in this eagerly anticipated book, he takes a closer look at the new economics of the Internet age, showing where business is going and exploring the huge opportunities that exist: for new producers, new e-tailers, and new tastemakers. He demonstrates how long tail economics apply to industries ranging from the toy business to advertising to kitchen appliances. He sets down the rules for operating in a long tail economy. And he provides a glimpse of a future that's already here.",The Long Tail: How Endless Choice is Creating Unlimited Demand,Chris Anderson, , ,Random House,9781847940360,"1st Edition,2009",267,India,English

In Who Moved My Cheese?: An Amazing Way To Deal With Change In Your Work And In Your Life, Spencer Johnson reveals how people can adapt to change in a positive manner. Beginning with an introduction by Kenneth Blanchard, the book reveals the story behind the main story. Johnson, in this book, employs the parable form to give readers insight on change and how to cope with it.

The book narrates the tale of four creatures, two mice and two tiny humans who are on a hunt for cheese. The author encapsulates the four predictable and typical reactions when the cheese is moved. Sniff and Scurry, the mice, and Hem and Haw, the humans, are initially happy with the seemingly unending supply at Cheese Station C, but are discontent when the supply starts getting depleted. Who Moved My Cheese takes this situation and discusses the best ways to react in such a situation. Instead of blaming others or resisting change, Spencer advises the readers to anticipate, monitor, adapt and enjoy the change. This short tale reminds readers that change should not hinder progress.

This tale of the four characters in the maze is similar to that of all the people who are hunting for good jobs, money, stable relationships and success. Spencer Johnson shows us how we can successfully deal with the inevitable changes in life. First published in 1998, the book has remained popular among readers of all ages. The book was on the New York Times business bestseller list for five years and has sold over 26 million copies and translated to many languages.

In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us into the thrilling and surprising world of the scientific study of habits.
He examines why some people and companies struggle to change,
despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. He visits laboratories where neuroscientists explore how
habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. And he uncovers how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and
civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr.
The result is a compelling argument and an empowering discovery: the key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive or even building revolutionary companies is understanding how habits work. By harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities,
and our lives.

How do you go about it? Billions of government dollars, and thousands of charitable organizations and NGOs, are dedicated to helping the worlds poor. But much of their work is based on assumptions about the poor and the world that are untested generalizations at best, harmful misperceptions at worst.

Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo have pioneered the use of randomized control trials (RCTs) in development economics through their award-winning Poverty Action Lab. They argue that by using RCTs and, more generally, by paying careful attention to the evidence, it is possible to make accurate and often startling assessments on what really impacts the poor and what doesnt.

Revelatory and impassioned, Poor Economics is a pathbreaking book that will help you to understand the real causes of poverty and how to end it.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life explores the history of human efforts to unravel the puzzles of the Universe. It starts with the Greeks. Particularly the Ionian Greeks and their contention that the the Universe had to have a cause based on the laws of science.

It covers landmark discoveries, like that of Copernicus who showed that the Earth was not the center of the Universe. It explains the various laws of physics that have provided answers to so many things that have puzzled people for long. The authors show that the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Physics have together helped humans understand many of the deep mysteries about the Universe. But the quest to find a single theory, a unified theory that will explain everything about everything has been elusive.

This Theory of Everything was a dream of Einstein, and other scientists have continued the quest. The Theory of Everything has had several candidates, and the latest is the M-Theory which the authors present as the most likely solution. They contend that the new discoveries make God unnecessary. They say that the laws of physics show that the Universe is a result of spontaneous creation.

They also explore the M-Theory further and explain that just like ours is not the only galaxy in the Universe, our Universe is not the only one out there. In fact, there might be one universe for each possible outcome of a situation, so the Universe that a person sees is a perception of reality from their viewpoint. They also propose that these universes could be so vastly different, some may not be capable of supporting life forms.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life is an intriguing exploration of all the discoveries that revealed the secrets of the Universe, and where science could proceed from now. It explains how physics could soon provide the ultimate answers to all the mysteries of the Universe.

In Occidental College, Obama described a different and carefree kind of life. After this, he moved to New York and majored in political science in Columbia University.

This book does not merely iterate the biographic details of the life led. The author emphasizes the pain, the emotions, and the jubilation he felt at every challenge he faced and eventually overcame.

At one point of the narrative, the author describes his journey to Kenya and meeting his relatives for the first time. This book stresses on the importance of race-relations and the need to obliterate racial divide.

Smith's seminal work, The Wealth of Nations, aims to create a new understanding of economics. Smith writes largely against the mercantile system that existed at the time of writing, but, along the way, gives a complicated but brilliant account of an economic system based in human nature and deeply rooted social dynamics. The text is characterized by fact-heavy digressions, tables, and appendices that blend hard research with broad generalities, demonstrating his commitment to give evidence for what seem like timeless observations about the nature of economics.

Books I and II focus on developing the idea of the division of labor, and describing how this division adds to the opulence of a given society by creating enormous surpluses, which can be exchanged among members. The division of labor also fuels technological innovation, by giving intense focus to certain tasks, and allowing workers to brainstorm ways to make these tasks more efficient. This, again, adds to efficiency and grows surpluses. Surpluses, Smith writes, may be either traded or re-invested. In the latter case, technologies are likely to improve, leading to even greater efficiencies.

Book III considers Great Britain in the context of the the social evolution of society in general, which begins, according to Smith, with hunting and gathering societies and progresses through agricultural stages to arrive at a state of international commerce. According to Smith, the fall of Rome and the rise of feudalism retarded this progression by creating a system of decreased efficiency.

Book IV goes on to criticize the “mercantile commerce” that characterized much of Smith's Europe. Smith's first major criticism of mercantilism is that it conflates value and wealth with precious metals. According to Smith, the real measure of the wealth of a nation is the stream of goods and services that the nation creates. In making this point, Smith invents the idea of gross domestic product, which has become central to modern economics. The wealth of a nation is increased not by hoarding metals, but by increasing the productive capacity by expanding the market—by increasing trade.

An important theme that persists throughout the work is the idea that the economic system is automatic, and, when left with substantial freedom, able to regulate itself. This is often referred to as the “invisible hand.” The ability to self-regulate and to ensure maximum efficiency, however, is threatened by monopolies, tax preferences, lobbying groups, and other “privileges” extended to certain members of the economy at the expense of others.

Finally, in the last book of The Wealth of Nations, Smith describes what he considers to be the appropriate roles of government, namely defense, justice, the creation and maintenance of public works that contribute to commerce, education, the maintenance of the “dignity of the sovereign,”—activities that are to be financed by fair and clear taxation.

They both share a close bond since their kindergarten days but are forced apart when Hajime moves away.

A decade later, we meet Hajime who lives in Tokyo. He has become a successful businessman and is married and has two wonderful children. The story takes a turn with the reappearance of Shimamoto.

Different ideologies. A love story. A country’s movement and lives spanning over decades, deciphering the map of the human heart. This could be in short the plot of The Lowland, the latest by Jhumpa Lahiri. And yet is a lot more than this. Jhumpa Lahiri’s books are never easy. They may seem an easy read on the surface, however a lot of complex emotions seethe underneath and that is just the case with “The Lowland”.

Jhumpa’s writing is not only surreal but also very high on the emotional factor. At the same time it isn’t overdone. The emotions are as subtle as the characters. The writing needs to be spoken more about – it is almost like every sentence had to be written or else the novel would be incomplete.

All one can say is that it is only befitting for her to be on the long and short list of the Booker Prize. If there is one book you must read this year, it has to be this one.

The ghosts of Grey’s past constantly tested the affair and although Ana knew the complexity of her ‘fifty shades’ there is no easy way to tackle a fascinating man with repulsive tastes. As she demands more than what Grey wills her to have, they grow apart only to be consumed further into their relationship which now must brave the trials that loving another involves.

Fifty Shades Freed opens with Ana and Grey finally together after the tumultuous affair they shared in the last two books are consummated. Ana is prepared to brave every battle for her part in this relationship but sometimes when fate deals a bad hand, there is really little chance in braving its trials. With Grey acquiring a company called SIP, Ana is still struggling with Christian’s past and his controlling behavior, the couple is battling more than anyone’s fair share of woes.

But there is more to this love affair than meets the eye of any common spectator or reader, as these two young adults believe in the power of their commitment. And this tides them across to better times. Although it might seem that their love survives the perils of life, they are tested yet again and this time, it is much worse than anything that both of them had anticipated, much less prepared for. The plot takes another turn when Mia is kidnapped and held for ransom.

E. L. James delivers a powerful close to the immensely popular trilogy through this book. Fifty Shades Freed engages the themes of past trauma in a most engaging manner in which both Ana and Christian are embroiled in and conflicted with. It was published in 2012 and opened to commercial acclaim.

Harris was looking for ways to transcend the limited results and slow processes involved in conventional psychiatry. He wanted to offer people a unique, accessible, and affordable solution to resolve their life problems. The method of Transactional Analysis (TA), pioneered by Eric Berne, lent itself very well to be that solution.

Transactional Analysis is a psychotherapy model that is based on the idea that adults always carry remnants of emotionally intense childhood experiences. Harris uses this model to link it to the work of a brain surgeon named Wilder Penfield. The latter conducted pioneering experiments to uncover the neurological basis of memory.

Drawing from the work of Berne and Wilder, Harris proceeds to introduce readers to a simplified version of TA or what he calls the Parent, Adult, Child (P-A-C) Model. According to this simplified model, in any given situation, a person switches between one of three psychological states, namely the Parent, the Adult, the Child.

The model further explores how, over the transition from childhood to adulthood, an individual’s opinions take shape, either through conditioning by rules or through his/her own examination of the world around. The book also puts forth a set of four ‘life positions’, any of which an individual assumes depending on a particular situation.

After detailing the P-A-C model, Harris goes on to explain how this model can form the basis for a positive, improved future for any individual, regardless of what has or has not transpired in his/her past. He presents invaluable techniques to help readers achieve mastery over themselves, their relationships, and their future.

I’m OK, You’re OK was first published in 1967. Its popularity soared continuously and it stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for two years. It has been translated into more than twelve languages and has sold more than 15 million copies.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done will teach readers how to master the art of execution by understanding strategy, operations, and how to link people together. These three processes are at the center of every business.

The book clearly points out that top leaders give too much importance to creating a vision, devising strategies, and formulating plans. After doing so, they remove themselves from the picture and delegate tasks to their subordinates. This methodology is frowned upon in this book. Instead, it is recommended that leaders should adopt a hands-on approach. According to the authors, it very important to be passionate and deeply involved in one’s organization. Having robust dialogues about individuals, operations, and strategies, results in a business culture that is based on realism and honesty. Therefore actually “running” a business depends on carrying out these processes and not necessarily having a vision and leaving the responsibility of execution on others.

The authors also maintain that one important job that a leader must execute is choosing and evaluating people. A task that should not be passed on to others. This entails personally checking references for key candidates and ensures that the right people will be selected for the right job. A gene pool with leadership is able to conceive and select strategies for execution that are in alignment with the economy, competition, and marketplace. When the right individual and strategy are selected, an operating procedure is chosen. This results in specific programs getting implemented and assigning accountability. The methodology outlined in this book is effective because it spells out an operating process which transcends the usual way of looking at budget and goals.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done was published in 2011.

What happens when there is almost unlimited choice? When everything becomes available to everyone? And when the combined value of the millions of items that only sell in small quantities equals or even exceeds the value of a handful of best-sellers?

In this ground-breaking book, Chris Anderson shows that the future of business does not lie in hits - the high-volume end of a traditional demand curve - but in what used to be regarded as misses - the endlessly long tail of that same curve. As our world is transformed by the Internet and the near infinite choice it offers consumers, so traditional business models are being overturned and new truths revealed about what consumers want and how they want to get it.

Chris Anderson first explored the Long Tail in an article in Wired magazine that has become one of the most influential business essays of our time. Now, in this eagerly anticipated book, he takes a closer look at the new economics of the Internet age, showing where business is going and exploring the huge opportunities that exist: for new producers, new e-tailers, and new tastemakers. He demonstrates how long tail economics apply to industries ranging from the toy business to advertising to kitchen appliances. He sets down the rules for operating in a long tail economy. And he provides a glimpse of a future that's already here.",The Long Tail: How Endless Choice is Creating Unlimited Demand,Chris Anderson, , ,Random House,9781847940360,"1st Edition,2009",267,India,English

In Who Moved My Cheese?: An Amazing Way To Deal With Change In Your Work And In Your Life, Spencer Johnson reveals how people can adapt to change in a positive manner. Beginning with an introduction by Kenneth Blanchard, the book reveals the story behind the main story. Johnson, in this book, employs the parable form to give readers insight on change and how to cope with it.

The book narrates the tale of four creatures, two mice and two tiny humans who are on a hunt for cheese. The author encapsulates the four predictable and typical reactions when the cheese is moved. Sniff and Scurry, the mice, and Hem and Haw, the humans, are initially happy with the seemingly unending supply at Cheese Station C, but are discontent when the supply starts getting depleted. Who Moved My Cheese takes this situation and discusses the best ways to react in such a situation. Instead of blaming others or resisting change, Spencer advises the readers to anticipate, monitor, adapt and enjoy the change. This short tale reminds readers that change should not hinder progress.

This tale of the four characters in the maze is similar to that of all the people who are hunting for good jobs, money, stable relationships and success. Spencer Johnson shows us how we can successfully deal with the inevitable changes in life. First published in 1998, the book has remained popular among readers of all ages. The book was on the New York Times business bestseller list for five years and has sold over 26 million copies and translated to many languages.

In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us into the thrilling and surprising world of the scientific study of habits.
He examines why some people and companies struggle to change,
despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. He visits laboratories where neuroscientists explore how
habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. And he uncovers how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and
civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr.
The result is a compelling argument and an empowering discovery: the key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive or even building revolutionary companies is understanding how habits work. By harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities,
and our lives.

How do you go about it? Billions of government dollars, and thousands of charitable organizations and NGOs, are dedicated to helping the worlds poor. But much of their work is based on assumptions about the poor and the world that are untested generalizations at best, harmful misperceptions at worst.

Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo have pioneered the use of randomized control trials (RCTs) in development economics through their award-winning Poverty Action Lab. They argue that by using RCTs and, more generally, by paying careful attention to the evidence, it is possible to make accurate and often startling assessments on what really impacts the poor and what doesnt.

Revelatory and impassioned, Poor Economics is a pathbreaking book that will help you to understand the real causes of poverty and how to end it.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life explores the history of human efforts to unravel the puzzles of the Universe. It starts with the Greeks. Particularly the Ionian Greeks and their contention that the the Universe had to have a cause based on the laws of science.

It covers landmark discoveries, like that of Copernicus who showed that the Earth was not the center of the Universe. It explains the various laws of physics that have provided answers to so many things that have puzzled people for long. The authors show that the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Physics have together helped humans understand many of the deep mysteries about the Universe. But the quest to find a single theory, a unified theory that will explain everything about everything has been elusive.

This Theory of Everything was a dream of Einstein, and other scientists have continued the quest. The Theory of Everything has had several candidates, and the latest is the M-Theory which the authors present as the most likely solution. They contend that the new discoveries make God unnecessary. They say that the laws of physics show that the Universe is a result of spontaneous creation.

They also explore the M-Theory further and explain that just like ours is not the only galaxy in the Universe, our Universe is not the only one out there. In fact, there might be one universe for each possible outcome of a situation, so the Universe that a person sees is a perception of reality from their viewpoint. They also propose that these universes could be so vastly different, some may not be capable of supporting life forms.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life is an intriguing exploration of all the discoveries that revealed the secrets of the Universe, and where science could proceed from now. It explains how physics could soon provide the ultimate answers to all the mysteries of the Universe.

The narrative begins with Obama’s life in Harvard Law School. Born in Hawaii, he led a difficult life having to deal with his parents’ divorce when he was only two. The absence of his father who was too busy finishing his Ph.D. in Harvard, led him to create an imaginary father figure for himself.

In Occidental College, Obama described a different and carefree kind of life. After this, he moved to New York and majored in political science in Columbia University.

This book does not merely iterate the biographic details of the life led. The author emphasizes the pain, the emotions, and the jubilation he felt at every challenge he faced and eventually overcame.

At one point of the narrative, the author describes his journey to Kenya and meeting his relatives for the first time. This book stresses on the importance of race-relations and the need to obliterate racial divide.

Smith's seminal work, The Wealth of Nations, aims to create a new understanding of economics. Smith writes largely against the mercantile system that existed at the time of writing, but, along the way, gives a complicated but brilliant account of an economic system based in human nature and deeply rooted social dynamics. The text is characterized by fact-heavy digressions, tables, and appendices that blend hard research with broad generalities, demonstrating his commitment to give evidence for what seem like timeless observations about the nature of economics.

Books I and II focus on developing the idea of the division of labor, and describing how this division adds to the opulence of a given society by creating enormous surpluses, which can be exchanged among members. The division of labor also fuels technological innovation, by giving intense focus to certain tasks, and allowing workers to brainstorm ways to make these tasks more efficient. This, again, adds to efficiency and grows surpluses. Surpluses, Smith writes, may be either traded or re-invested. In the latter case, technologies are likely to improve, leading to even greater efficiencies.

Book III considers Great Britain in the context of the the social evolution of society in general, which begins, according to Smith, with hunting and gathering societies and progresses through agricultural stages to arrive at a state of international commerce. According to Smith, the fall of Rome and the rise of feudalism retarded this progression by creating a system of decreased efficiency.

Book IV goes on to criticize the “mercantile commerce” that characterized much of Smith's Europe. Smith's first major criticism of mercantilism is that it conflates value and wealth with precious metals. According to Smith, the real measure of the wealth of a nation is the stream of goods and services that the nation creates. In making this point, Smith invents the idea of gross domestic product, which has become central to modern economics. The wealth of a nation is increased not by hoarding metals, but by increasing the productive capacity by expanding the market—by increasing trade.

An important theme that persists throughout the work is the idea that the economic system is automatic, and, when left with substantial freedom, able to regulate itself. This is often referred to as the “invisible hand.” The ability to self-regulate and to ensure maximum efficiency, however, is threatened by monopolies, tax preferences, lobbying groups, and other “privileges” extended to certain members of the economy at the expense of others.

Finally, in the last book of The Wealth of Nations, Smith describes what he considers to be the appropriate roles of government, namely defense, justice, the creation and maintenance of public works that contribute to commerce, education, the maintenance of the “dignity of the sovereign,”—activities that are to be financed by fair and clear taxation.

Jhumpa’s writing is not only surreal but also very high on the emotional factor. At the same time it isn’t overdone. The emotions are as subtle as the characters. The writing needs to be spoken more about – it is almost like every sentence had to be written or else the novel would be incomplete.

All one can say is that it is only befitting for her to be on the long and short list of the Booker Prize. If there is one book you must read this year, it has to be this one.

The ghosts of Grey’s past constantly tested the affair and although Ana knew the complexity of her ‘fifty shades’ there is no easy way to tackle a fascinating man with repulsive tastes. As she demands more than what Grey wills her to have, they grow apart only to be consumed further into their relationship which now must brave the trials that loving another involves.

Fifty Shades Freed opens with Ana and Grey finally together after the tumultuous affair they shared in the last two books are consummated. Ana is prepared to brave every battle for her part in this relationship but sometimes when fate deals a bad hand, there is really little chance in braving its trials. With Grey acquiring a company called SIP, Ana is still struggling with Christian’s past and his controlling behavior, the couple is battling more than anyone’s fair share of woes.

But there is more to this love affair than meets the eye of any common spectator or reader, as these two young adults believe in the power of their commitment. And this tides them across to better times. Although it might seem that their love survives the perils of life, they are tested yet again and this time, it is much worse than anything that both of them had anticipated, much less prepared for. The plot takes another turn when Mia is kidnapped and held for ransom.

E. L. James delivers a powerful close to the immensely popular trilogy through this book. Fifty Shades Freed engages the themes of past trauma in a most engaging manner in which both Ana and Christian are embroiled in and conflicted with. It was published in 2012 and opened to commercial acclaim.

Harris was looking for ways to transcend the limited results and slow processes involved in conventional psychiatry. He wanted to offer people a unique, accessible, and affordable solution to resolve their life problems. The method of Transactional Analysis (TA), pioneered by Eric Berne, lent itself very well to be that solution.

Transactional Analysis is a psychotherapy model that is based on the idea that adults always carry remnants of emotionally intense childhood experiences. Harris uses this model to link it to the work of a brain surgeon named Wilder Penfield. The latter conducted pioneering experiments to uncover the neurological basis of memory.

Drawing from the work of Berne and Wilder, Harris proceeds to introduce readers to a simplified version of TA or what he calls the Parent, Adult, Child (P-A-C) Model. According to this simplified model, in any given situation, a person switches between one of three psychological states, namely the Parent, the Adult, the Child.

The model further explores how, over the transition from childhood to adulthood, an individual’s opinions take shape, either through conditioning by rules or through his/her own examination of the world around. The book also puts forth a set of four ‘life positions’, any of which an individual assumes depending on a particular situation.

After detailing the P-A-C model, Harris goes on to explain how this model can form the basis for a positive, improved future for any individual, regardless of what has or has not transpired in his/her past. He presents invaluable techniques to help readers achieve mastery over themselves, their relationships, and their future.

I’m OK, You’re OK was first published in 1967. Its popularity soared continuously and it stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for two years. It has been translated into more than twelve languages and has sold more than 15 million copies.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done will teach readers how to master the art of execution by understanding strategy, operations, and how to link people together. These three processes are at the center of every business.

The book clearly points out that top leaders give too much importance to creating a vision, devising strategies, and formulating plans. After doing so, they remove themselves from the picture and delegate tasks to their subordinates. This methodology is frowned upon in this book. Instead, it is recommended that leaders should adopt a hands-on approach. According to the authors, it very important to be passionate and deeply involved in one’s organization. Having robust dialogues about individuals, operations, and strategies, results in a business culture that is based on realism and honesty. Therefore actually “running” a business depends on carrying out these processes and not necessarily having a vision and leaving the responsibility of execution on others.

The authors also maintain that one important job that a leader must execute is choosing and evaluating people. A task that should not be passed on to others. This entails personally checking references for key candidates and ensures that the right people will be selected for the right job. A gene pool with leadership is able to conceive and select strategies for execution that are in alignment with the economy, competition, and marketplace. When the right individual and strategy are selected, an operating procedure is chosen. This results in specific programs getting implemented and assigning accountability. The methodology outlined in this book is effective because it spells out an operating process which transcends the usual way of looking at budget and goals.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done was published in 2011.

My novel of the year' Nadime Gordimer

Beginning with an unlikely stowaway’s account of life on board Noah’s Ark, A History of the World in 10½ Chapters presents a surprising, subversive, fictional history of earth told from several kaleidoscopic perspectives. Noah disembarks from his ark but he and his Voyage are not forgotten: they are revisited in on other centuries and other climes - by a Victorian spinster mourning her father, by an American astronaut on an obsessive personal mission. We journey to the Titanic, to the Amazon, to the raft of the Medusa, and to an ecclesiastical court in medieval France where a bizarre case is about to begin...

What happens when there is almost unlimited choice? When everything becomes available to everyone? And when the combined value of the millions of items that only sell in small quantities equals or even exceeds the value of a handful of best-sellers?

In this ground-breaking book, Chris Anderson shows that the future of business does not lie in hits - the high-volume end of a traditional demand curve - but in what used to be regarded as misses - the endlessly long tail of that same curve. As our world is transformed by the Internet and the near infinite choice it offers consumers, so traditional business models are being overturned and new truths revealed about what consumers want and how they want to get it.

Chris Anderson first explored the Long Tail in an article in Wired magazine that has become one of the most influential business essays of our time. Now, in this eagerly anticipated book, he takes a closer look at the new economics of the Internet age, showing where business is going and exploring the huge opportunities that exist: for new producers, new e-tailers, and new tastemakers. He demonstrates how long tail economics apply to industries ranging from the toy business to advertising to kitchen appliances. He sets down the rules for operating in a long tail economy. And he provides a glimpse of a future that's already here.",The Long Tail: How Endless Choice is Creating Unlimited Demand,Chris Anderson, , ,Random House,9781847940360,"1st Edition,2009",267,India,English

In Who Moved My Cheese?: An Amazing Way To Deal With Change In Your Work And In Your Life, Spencer Johnson reveals how people can adapt to change in a positive manner. Beginning with an introduction by Kenneth Blanchard, the book reveals the story behind the main story. Johnson, in this book, employs the parable form to give readers insight on change and how to cope with it.

The book narrates the tale of four creatures, two mice and two tiny humans who are on a hunt for cheese. The author encapsulates the four predictable and typical reactions when the cheese is moved. Sniff and Scurry, the mice, and Hem and Haw, the humans, are initially happy with the seemingly unending supply at Cheese Station C, but are discontent when the supply starts getting depleted. Who Moved My Cheese takes this situation and discusses the best ways to react in such a situation. Instead of blaming others or resisting change, Spencer advises the readers to anticipate, monitor, adapt and enjoy the change. This short tale reminds readers that change should not hinder progress.

This tale of the four characters in the maze is similar to that of all the people who are hunting for good jobs, money, stable relationships and success. Spencer Johnson shows us how we can successfully deal with the inevitable changes in life. First published in 1998, the book has remained popular among readers of all ages. The book was on the New York Times business bestseller list for five years and has sold over 26 million copies and translated to many languages.

In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us into the thrilling and surprising world of the scientific study of habits.
He examines why some people and companies struggle to change,
despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. He visits laboratories where neuroscientists explore how
habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. And he uncovers how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and
civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr.
The result is a compelling argument and an empowering discovery: the key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive or even building revolutionary companies is understanding how habits work. By harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities,
and our lives.

How do you go about it? Billions of government dollars, and thousands of charitable organizations and NGOs, are dedicated to helping the worlds poor. But much of their work is based on assumptions about the poor and the world that are untested generalizations at best, harmful misperceptions at worst.

Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo have pioneered the use of randomized control trials (RCTs) in development economics through their award-winning Poverty Action Lab. They argue that by using RCTs and, more generally, by paying careful attention to the evidence, it is possible to make accurate and often startling assessments on what really impacts the poor and what doesnt.

Revelatory and impassioned, Poor Economics is a pathbreaking book that will help you to understand the real causes of poverty and how to end it.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life explores the history of human efforts to unravel the puzzles of the Universe. It starts with the Greeks. Particularly the Ionian Greeks and their contention that the the Universe had to have a cause based on the laws of science.

It covers landmark discoveries, like that of Copernicus who showed that the Earth was not the center of the Universe. It explains the various laws of physics that have provided answers to so many things that have puzzled people for long. The authors show that the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Physics have together helped humans understand many of the deep mysteries about the Universe. But the quest to find a single theory, a unified theory that will explain everything about everything has been elusive.

This Theory of Everything was a dream of Einstein, and other scientists have continued the quest. The Theory of Everything has had several candidates, and the latest is the M-Theory which the authors present as the most likely solution. They contend that the new discoveries make God unnecessary. They say that the laws of physics show that the Universe is a result of spontaneous creation.

They also explore the M-Theory further and explain that just like ours is not the only galaxy in the Universe, our Universe is not the only one out there. In fact, there might be one universe for each possible outcome of a situation, so the Universe that a person sees is a perception of reality from their viewpoint. They also propose that these universes could be so vastly different, some may not be capable of supporting life forms.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life is an intriguing exploration of all the discoveries that revealed the secrets of the Universe, and where science could proceed from now. It explains how physics could soon provide the ultimate answers to all the mysteries of the Universe.

In Occidental College, Obama described a different and carefree kind of life. After this, he moved to New York and majored in political science in Columbia University.

This book does not merely iterate the biographic details of the life led. The author emphasizes the pain, the emotions, and the jubilation he felt at every challenge he faced and eventually overcame.

At one point of the narrative, the author describes his journey to Kenya and meeting his relatives for the first time. This book stresses on the importance of race-relations and the need to obliterate racial divide.

Smith's seminal work, The Wealth of Nations, aims to create a new understanding of economics. Smith writes largely against the mercantile system that existed at the time of writing, but, along the way, gives a complicated but brilliant account of an economic system based in human nature and deeply rooted social dynamics. The text is characterized by fact-heavy digressions, tables, and appendices that blend hard research with broad generalities, demonstrating his commitment to give evidence for what seem like timeless observations about the nature of economics.

Books I and II focus on developing the idea of the division of labor, and describing how this division adds to the opulence of a given society by creating enormous surpluses, which can be exchanged among members. The division of labor also fuels technological innovation, by giving intense focus to certain tasks, and allowing workers to brainstorm ways to make these tasks more efficient. This, again, adds to efficiency and grows surpluses. Surpluses, Smith writes, may be either traded or re-invested. In the latter case, technologies are likely to improve, leading to even greater efficiencies.

Book III considers Great Britain in the context of the the social evolution of society in general, which begins, according to Smith, with hunting and gathering societies and progresses through agricultural stages to arrive at a state of international commerce. According to Smith, the fall of Rome and the rise of feudalism retarded this progression by creating a system of decreased efficiency.

Book IV goes on to criticize the “mercantile commerce” that characterized much of Smith's Europe. Smith's first major criticism of mercantilism is that it conflates value and wealth with precious metals. According to Smith, the real measure of the wealth of a nation is the stream of goods and services that the nation creates. In making this point, Smith invents the idea of gross domestic product, which has become central to modern economics. The wealth of a nation is increased not by hoarding metals, but by increasing the productive capacity by expanding the market—by increasing trade.

An important theme that persists throughout the work is the idea that the economic system is automatic, and, when left with substantial freedom, able to regulate itself. This is often referred to as the “invisible hand.” The ability to self-regulate and to ensure maximum efficiency, however, is threatened by monopolies, tax preferences, lobbying groups, and other “privileges” extended to certain members of the economy at the expense of others.

Finally, in the last book of The Wealth of Nations, Smith describes what he considers to be the appropriate roles of government, namely defense, justice, the creation and maintenance of public works that contribute to commerce, education, the maintenance of the “dignity of the sovereign,”—activities that are to be financed by fair and clear taxation.

They may seem an easy read on the surface, however a lot of complex emotions seethe underneath and that is just the case with “The Lowland”.

Jhumpa’s writing is not only surreal but also very high on the emotional factor. At the same time it isn’t overdone. The emotions are as subtle as the characters. The writing needs to be spoken more about – it is almost like every sentence had to be written or else the novel would be incomplete.

The ghosts of Grey’s past constantly tested the affair and although Ana knew the complexity of her ‘fifty shades’ there is no easy way to tackle a fascinating man with repulsive tastes. As she demands more than what Grey wills her to have, they grow apart only to be consumed further into their relationship which now must brave the trials that loving another involves.

Fifty Shades Freed opens with Ana and Grey finally together after the tumultuous affair they shared in the last two books are consummated. Ana is prepared to brave every battle for her part in this relationship but sometimes when fate deals a bad hand, there is really little chance in braving its trials. With Grey acquiring a company called SIP, Ana is still struggling with Christian’s past and his controlling behavior, the couple is battling more than anyone’s fair share of woes.

But there is more to this love affair than meets the eye of any common spectator or reader, as these two young adults believe in the power of their commitment. And this tides them across to better times. Although it might seem that their love survives the perils of life, they are tested yet again and this time, it is much worse than anything that both of them had anticipated, much less prepared for. The plot takes another turn when Mia is kidnapped and held for ransom.

E. L. James delivers a powerful close to the immensely popular trilogy through this book. Fifty Shades Freed engages the themes of past trauma in a most engaging manner in which both Ana and Christian are embroiled in and conflicted with. It was published in 2012 and opened to commercial acclaim.

Harris was looking for ways to transcend the limited results and slow processes involved in conventional psychiatry. He wanted to offer people a unique, accessible, and affordable solution to resolve their life problems. The method of Transactional Analysis (TA), pioneered by Eric Berne, lent itself very well to be that solution.

Transactional Analysis is a psychotherapy model that is based on the idea that adults always carry remnants of emotionally intense childhood experiences. Harris uses this model to link it to the work of a brain surgeon named Wilder Penfield. The latter conducted pioneering experiments to uncover the neurological basis of memory.

Drawing from the work of Berne and Wilder, Harris proceeds to introduce readers to a simplified version of TA or what he calls the Parent, Adult, Child (P-A-C) Model. According to this simplified model, in any given situation, a person switches between one of three psychological states, namely the Parent, the Adult, the Child.

The model further explores how, over the transition from childhood to adulthood, an individual’s opinions take shape, either through conditioning by rules or through his/her own examination of the world around. The book also puts forth a set of four ‘life positions’, any of which an individual assumes depending on a particular situation.

After detailing the P-A-C model, Harris goes on to explain how this model can form the basis for a positive, improved future for any individual, regardless of what has or has not transpired in his/her past. He presents invaluable techniques to help readers achieve mastery over themselves, their relationships, and their future.

I’m OK, You’re OK was first published in 1967. Its popularity soared continuously and it stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for two years. It has been translated into more than twelve languages and has sold more than 15 million copies.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done will teach readers how to master the art of execution by understanding strategy, operations, and how to link people together. These three processes are at the center of every business.

The book clearly points out that top leaders give too much importance to creating a vision, devising strategies, and formulating plans. After doing so, they remove themselves from the picture and delegate tasks to their subordinates. This methodology is frowned upon in this book. Instead, it is recommended that leaders should adopt a hands-on approach. According to the authors, it very important to be passionate and deeply involved in one’s organization. Having robust dialogues about individuals, operations, and strategies, results in a business culture that is based on realism and honesty. Therefore actually “running” a business depends on carrying out these processes and not necessarily having a vision and leaving the responsibility of execution on others.

The authors also maintain that one important job that a leader must execute is choosing and evaluating people. A task that should not be passed on to others. This entails personally checking references for key candidates and ensures that the right people will be selected for the right job. A gene pool with leadership is able to conceive and select strategies for execution that are in alignment with the economy, competition, and marketplace. When the right individual and strategy are selected, an operating procedure is chosen. This results in specific programs getting implemented and assigning accountability. The methodology outlined in this book is effective because it spells out an operating process which transcends the usual way of looking at budget and goals.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done was published in 2011.

Can decline be detected early and avoided? How far can a company fall before the path toward doom becomes inevitable and unshakable? How can companies reverse course?\n\nIn How the Mighty Fall, Collins confronts these questions, offering leaders the well-founded hope that they can learn how to stave off decline and, if they find themselves falling, reverse their course. Collins? research project?more than four years in duration?uncovered five step-wise stages of decline: \n\nStage 1: Hubris Born of Success\nStage 2: Undisciplined Pursuit of More\nStage 3: Denial of Risk and Peril\nStage 4: Grasping for Salvation\nStage 5: Capitulation to Irrelevance or Death\n\nBy understanding these stages of decline, leaders can substantially reduce their chances of falling all the way to the bottom.\n\nGreat companies can stumble, badly, and recover.\n\nEvery institution, no matter how great, is vulnerable to decline. There is no law of nature that the most powerful will inevitably remain at the top. Anyone can fall and most eventually do. But, as Collins? research emphasizes, some companies do indeed recover?in some cases, coming back even stronger?even after having crashed into the depths of Stage 4.\n\nDecline, it turns out, is largely self-inflicted, and the path to recovery lies largely within our own hands.

My novel of the year' Nadime Gordimer

Beginning with an unlikely stowaway’s account of life on board Noah’s Ark, A History of the World in 10½ Chapters presents a surprising, subversive, fictional history of earth told from several kaleidoscopic perspectives. Noah disembarks from his ark but he and his Voyage are not forgotten: they are revisited in on other centuries and other climes - by a Victorian spinster mourning her father, by an American astronaut on an obsessive personal mission. We journey to the Titanic, to the Amazon, to the raft of the Medusa, and to an ecclesiastical court in medieval France where a bizarre case is about to begin... This is no ordinary history, but something stranger, a challenge and a delight for the reader's imagination.

What happens when there is almost unlimited choice? When everything becomes available to everyone? And when the combined value of the millions of items that only sell in small quantities equals or even exceeds the value of a handful of best-sellers?

In this ground-breaking book, Chris Anderson shows that the future of business does not lie in hits - the high-volume end of a traditional demand curve - but in what used to be regarded as misses - the endlessly long tail of that same curve. As our world is transformed by the Internet and the near infinite choice it offers consumers, so traditional business models are being overturned and new truths revealed about what consumers want and how they want to get it.

Chris Anderson first explored the Long Tail in an article in Wired magazine that has become one of the most influential business essays of our time. Now, in this eagerly anticipated book, he takes a closer look at the new economics of the Internet age, showing where business is going and exploring the huge opportunities that exist: for new producers, new e-tailers, and new tastemakers. He demonstrates how long tail economics apply to industries ranging from the toy business to advertising to kitchen appliances. He sets down the rules for operating in a long tail economy. And he provides a glimpse of a future that's already here.",The Long Tail: How Endless Choice is Creating Unlimited Demand,Chris Anderson, , ,Random House,9781847940360,"1st Edition,2009",267,India,English

In Who Moved My Cheese?: An Amazing Way To Deal With Change In Your Work And In Your Life, Spencer Johnson reveals how people can adapt to change in a positive manner. Beginning with an introduction by Kenneth Blanchard, the book reveals the story behind the main story. Johnson, in this book, employs the parable form to give readers insight on change and how to cope with it.

The book narrates the tale of four creatures, two mice and two tiny humans who are on a hunt for cheese. The author encapsulates the four predictable and typical reactions when the cheese is moved. Sniff and Scurry, the mice, and Hem and Haw, the humans, are initially happy with the seemingly unending supply at Cheese Station C, but are discontent when the supply starts getting depleted. Who Moved My Cheese takes this situation and discusses the best ways to react in such a situation. Instead of blaming others or resisting change, Spencer advises the readers to anticipate, monitor, adapt and enjoy the change. This short tale reminds readers that change should not hinder progress.

This tale of the four characters in the maze is similar to that of all the people who are hunting for good jobs, money, stable relationships and success. Spencer Johnson shows us how we can successfully deal with the inevitable changes in life. First published in 1998, the book has remained popular among readers of all ages. The book was on the New York Times business bestseller list for five years and has sold over 26 million copies and translated to many languages.

In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us into the thrilling and surprising world of the scientific study of habits.
He examines why some people and companies struggle to change,
despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. He visits laboratories where neuroscientists explore how
habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. And he uncovers how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and
civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr.
The result is a compelling argument and an empowering discovery: the key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive or even building revolutionary companies is understanding how habits work. By harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities,
and our lives.

Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with exuberant humour the irrationality of adult attitudes to race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina of one man's struggle for justice. But the Weight of history will only tolerate so much.

How do you go about it? Billions of government dollars, and thousands of charitable organizations and NGOs, are dedicated to helping the worlds poor. But much of their work is based on assumptions about the poor and the world that are untested generalizations at best, harmful misperceptions at worst.

Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo have pioneered the use of randomized control trials (RCTs) in development economics through their award-winning Poverty Action Lab. They argue that by using RCTs and, more generally, by paying careful attention to the evidence, it is possible to make accurate and often startling assessments on what really impacts the poor and what doesnt.

Revelatory and impassioned, Poor Economics is a pathbreaking book that will help you to understand the real causes of poverty and how to end it.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life explores the history of human efforts to unravel the puzzles of the Universe. It starts with the Greeks. Particularly the Ionian Greeks and their contention that the the Universe had to have a cause based on the laws of science.

It covers landmark discoveries, like that of Copernicus who showed that the Earth was not the center of the Universe. It explains the various laws of physics that have provided answers to so many things that have puzzled people for long. The authors show that the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Physics have together helped humans understand many of the deep mysteries about the Universe. But the quest to find a single theory, a unified theory that will explain everything about everything has been elusive.

This Theory of Everything was a dream of Einstein, and other scientists have continued the quest. The Theory of Everything has had several candidates, and the latest is the M-Theory which the authors present as the most likely solution. They contend that the new discoveries make God unnecessary. They say that the laws of physics show that the Universe is a result of spontaneous creation.

They also explore the M-Theory further and explain that just like ours is not the only galaxy in the Universe, our Universe is not the only one out there. In fact, there might be one universe for each possible outcome of a situation, so the Universe that a person sees is a perception of reality from their viewpoint. They also propose that these universes could be so vastly different, some may not be capable of supporting life forms.

The Grand Design: New Answers To The Ultimate Questions Of Life is an intriguing exploration of all the discoveries that revealed the secrets of the Universe, and where science could proceed from now. It explains how physics could soon provide the ultimate answers to all the mysteries of the Universe.

In Occidental College, Obama described a different and carefree kind of life. After this, he moved to New York and majored in political science in Columbia University.

This book does not merely iterate the biographic details of the life led. The author emphasizes the pain, the emotions, and the jubilation he felt at every challenge he faced and eventually overcame.

Smith's seminal work, The Wealth of Nations, aims to create a new understanding of economics. Smith writes largely against the mercantile system that existed at the time of writing, but, along the way, gives a complicated but brilliant account of an economic system based in human nature and deeply rooted social dynamics. The text is characterized by fact-heavy digressions, tables, and appendices that blend hard research with broad generalities, demonstrating his commitment to give evidence for what seem like timeless observations about the nature of economics.

Books I and II focus on developing the idea of the division of labor, and describing how this division adds to the opulence of a given society by creating enormous surpluses, which can be exchanged among members. The division of labor also fuels technological innovation, by giving intense focus to certain tasks, and allowing workers to brainstorm ways to make these tasks more efficient. This, again, adds to efficiency and grows surpluses. Surpluses, Smith writes, may be either traded or re-invested. In the latter case, technologies are likely to improve, leading to even greater efficiencies.

Book III considers Great Britain in the context of the the social evolution of society in general, which begins, according to Smith, with hunting and gathering societies and progresses through agricultural stages to arrive at a state of international commerce. According to Smith, the fall of Rome and the rise of feudalism retarded this progression by creating a system of decreased efficiency.

Book IV goes on to criticize the “mercantile commerce” that characterized much of Smith's Europe. Smith's first major criticism of mercantilism is that it conflates value and wealth with precious metals. According to Smith, the real measure of the wealth of a nation is the stream of goods and services that the nation creates. In making this point, Smith invents the idea of gross domestic product, which has become central to modern economics. The wealth of a nation is increased not by hoarding metals, but by increasing the productive capacity by expanding the market—by increasing trade.

An important theme that persists throughout the work is the idea that the economic system is automatic, and, when left with substantial freedom, able to regulate itself. This is often referred to as the “invisible hand.” The ability to self-regulate and to ensure maximum efficiency, however, is threatened by monopolies, tax preferences, lobbying groups, and other “privileges” extended to certain members of the economy at the expense of others.

Finally, in the last book of The Wealth of Nations, Smith describes what he considers to be the appropriate roles of government, namely defense, justice, the creation and maintenance of public works that contribute to commerce, education, the maintenance of the “dignity of the sovereign,”—activities that are to be financed by fair and clear taxation.

They may seem an easy read on the surface, however a lot of complex emotions seethe underneath and that is just the case with “The Lowland”.

Jhumpa’s writing is not only surreal but also very high on the emotional factor. At the same time it isn’t overdone. The emotions are as subtle as the characters. The writing needs to be spoken more about – it is almost like every sentence had to be written or else the novel would be incomplete.

All one can say is that it is only befitting for her to be on the long and short list of the Booker Prize. If there is one book you must read this year, it has to be this one.

The ghosts of Grey’s past constantly tested the affair and although Ana knew the complexity of her ‘fifty shades’ there is no easy way to tackle a fascinating man with repulsive tastes. As she demands more than what Grey wills her to have, they grow apart only to be consumed further into their relationship which now must brave the trials that loving another involves.

Fifty Shades Freed opens with Ana and Grey finally together after the tumultuous affair they shared in the last two books are consummated. Ana is prepared to brave every battle for her part in this relationship but sometimes when fate deals a bad hand, there is really little chance in braving its trials. With Grey acquiring a company called SIP, Ana is still struggling with Christian’s past and his controlling behavior, the couple is battling more than anyone’s fair share of woes.

But there is more to this love affair than meets the eye of any common spectator or reader, as these two young adults believe in the power of their commitment. And this tides them across to better times. Although it might seem that their love survives the perils of life, they are tested yet again and this time, it is much worse than anything that both of them had anticipated, much less prepared for. The plot takes another turn when Mia is kidnapped and held for ransom.

E. L. James delivers a powerful close to the immensely popular trilogy through this book. Fifty Shades Freed engages the themes of past trauma in a most engaging manner in which both Ana and Christian are embroiled in and conflicted with. It was published in 2012 and opened to commercial acclaim.

Harris was looking for ways to transcend the limited results and slow processes involved in conventional psychiatry. He wanted to offer people a unique, accessible, and affordable solution to resolve their life problems. The method of Transactional Analysis (TA), pioneered by Eric Berne, lent itself very well to be that solution.

Transactional Analysis is a psychotherapy model that is based on the idea that adults always carry remnants of emotionally intense childhood experiences. Harris uses this model to link it to the work of a brain surgeon named Wilder Penfield. The latter conducted pioneering experiments to uncover the neurological basis of memory.

Drawing from the work of Berne and Wilder, Harris proceeds to introduce readers to a simplified version of TA or what he calls the Parent, Adult, Child (P-A-C) Model. According to this simplified model, in any given situation, a person switches between one of three psychological states, namely the Parent, the Adult, the Child.

The model further explores how, over the transition from childhood to adulthood, an individual’s opinions take shape, either through conditioning by rules or through his/her own examination of the world around. The book also puts forth a set of four ‘life positions’, any of which an individual assumes depending on a particular situation.

After detailing the P-A-C model, Harris goes on to explain how this model can form the basis for a positive, improved future for any individual, regardless of what has or has not transpired in his/her past. He presents invaluable techniques to help readers achieve mastery over themselves, their relationships, and their future.

I’m OK, You’re OK was first published in 1967. Its popularity soared continuously and it stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for two years. It has been translated into more than twelve languages and has sold more than 15 million copies.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done will teach readers how to master the art of execution by understanding strategy, operations, and how to link people together. These three processes are at the center of every business.

The book clearly points out that top leaders give too much importance to creating a vision, devising strategies, and formulating plans. After doing so, they remove themselves from the picture and delegate tasks to their subordinates. This methodology is frowned upon in this book. Instead, it is recommended that leaders should adopt a hands-on approach. According to the authors, it very important to be passionate and deeply involved in one’s organization. Having robust dialogues about individuals, operations, and strategies, results in a business culture that is based on realism and honesty. Therefore actually “running” a business depends on carrying out these processes and not necessarily having a vision and leaving the responsibility of execution on others.

The authors also maintain that one important job that a leader must execute is choosing and evaluating people. A task that should not be passed on to others. This entails personally checking references for key candidates and ensures that the right people will be selected for the right job. A gene pool with leadership is able to conceive and select strategies for execution that are in alignment with the economy, competition, and marketplace. When the right individual and strategy are selected, an operating procedure is chosen. This results in specific programs getting implemented and assigning accountability. The methodology outlined in this book is effective because it spells out an operating process which transcends the usual way of looking at budget and goals.

Execution: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done was published in 2011.

Can decline be detected early and avoided? How far can a company fall before the path toward doom becomes inevitable and unshakable? How can companies reverse course?\n\nIn How the Mighty Fall, Collins confronts these questions, offering leaders the well-founded hope that they can learn how to stave off decline and, if they find themselves falling, reverse their course. Collins? research project?more than four years in duration?uncovered five step-wise stages of decline: \n\nStage 1: Hubris Born of Success\nStage 2: Undisciplined Pursuit of More\nStage 3: Denial of Risk and Peril\nStage 4: Grasping for Salvation\nStage 5: Capitulation to Irrelevance or Death\n\nBy understanding these stages of decline, leaders can substantially reduce their chances of falling all the way to the bottom.\n\nGreat companies can stumble, badly, and recover.\n\nEvery institution, no matter how great, is vulnerable to decline. There is no law of nature that the most powerful will inevitably remain at the top. Anyone can fall and most eventually do. But, as Collins? research emphasizes, some companies do indeed recover?in some cases, coming back even stronger?even after having crashed into the depths of Stage 4.\n\nDecline, it turns out, is largely self-inflicted, and the path to recovery lies largely within our own hands.

My novel of the year' Nadime Gordimer

Beginning with an unlikely stowaway’s account of life on board Noah’s Ark, A History of the World in 10½ Chapters presents a surprising, subversive, fictional history of earth told from several kaleidoscopic perspectives. Noah disembarks from his ark but he and his Voyage are not forgotten: they are revisited in on other centuries and other climes - by a Victorian spinster mourning her father, by an American astronaut on an obsessive personal mission. We journey to the Titanic, to the Amazon, to the raft of the Medusa, and to an ecclesiastical court in medieval France where a bizarre case is about to begin... This is no ordinary history, but something stranger, a challenge and a delight for the reader's imagination.

What happens when there is almost unlimited choice? When everything becomes available to everyone? And when the combined value of the millions of items that only sell in small quantities equals or even exceeds the value of a handful of best-sellers?

In this ground-breaking book, Chris Anderson shows that the future of business does not lie in hits - the high-volume end of a traditional demand curve - but in what used to be regarded as misses - the endlessly long tail of that same curve. As our world is transformed by the Internet and the near infinite choice it offers consumers, so traditional business models are being overturned and new truths revealed about what consumers want and how they want to get it.

Chris Anderson first explored the Long Tail in an article in Wired magazine that has become one of the most influential business essays of our time. Now, in this eagerly anticipated book, he takes a closer look at the new economics of the Internet age, showing where business is going and exploring the huge opportunities that exist: for new producers, new e-tailers, and new tastemakers. He demonstrates how long tail economics apply to industries ranging from the toy business to advertising to kitchen appliances. He sets down the rules for operating in a long tail economy. And he provides a glimpse of a future that's already here.",The Long Tail: How Endless Choice is Creating Unlimited Demand,Chris Anderson, , ,Random House,9781847940360,"1st Edition,2009",267,India,English
