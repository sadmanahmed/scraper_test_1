Catch - 22,জোসেফ হেলার,TK. 718,"",https://rokomari.com//book/90987/catch---22,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/rokimg20141031_90987.gif,"Catch-22 has become a common phrase now, and it is used to describe contradictory situations where the solution takes you back in another way to the original problem.

The phrase has its origin in this book. Set in the time of the Second World War, the story of Catch-22 is centered around characters stationed  in an island in the Mediterranean Sea. The island of Pianosa is home to the 256th squadron, which includes the central character, Captain John Yossarian.
The story is told from a third-person perspective, and so it moves from one person to the next, providing different view points according to each person’s character.

Captain Yossarian is a young man who believes very practically that his life is important and the results of a war do not matter to a man who is dead. He tries his best to keep from going on flying missions by faking illness. But his efforts are countered by Colonel Cathcart. He constantly increases the number missions an airman must fly to complete his service.

Yossarian desperately tries to avoid flying more missions because, as he puts it, when he flies to drop bombs on people, so many people he has not even met are trying to kill him.

Catch-22 is a hilariously funny satire about war, the higher command in the military and bureaucracy in general. The books title, Catch-22, is a clause in the military rules. Yossarian sees it with reference to his friend Orr. The rule is self-contradictory and leads to a circular logic that cannot provide a solution.
The rule states that if a person continues to fly on dangerous missions, he is insane and can be relieved of duty. On this premise, Orr is crazy; so he can get grounded. But, there is a catch: the rule also says that a concern for personal safety when faced with dangers that are real and immediate was a reflection of a sane mind. So, if Orr asked to be relieved, he would no longer be considered crazy, and hence will have to continue flying more missions.",Catch - 22,Joseph Heller, , ,Random House Publishing Group,9780099536017,"1st Edition,1994",570,India,English

The plot of The Brothers Karamazov revolves around the murder of Fyodor Karamazov, a grasping Russian landowner with three legitimate children—Dmitri, Ivan, and Alyosha. Each son has a dominant personality trait: Dmitri possesses broad passions, Ivan is a cool intellectual, and Alyosha has a spiritual orientation. Another member of the Karamazov household, a servant named Pavel Smerdyakov, is rumored to be Fyodor’s illegitimate son, and he emanates corrosive malevolence.

As the novel opens, Fyodor and Dmitri are in competition for the affections of a young woman named Grushenka. Although Dmitri is betrothed to Katerina Ivanovna, a proud woman of the gentry, he has fallen madly in love with Grushenka, but Grushenka keeps both Dmitri and Fyodor at a distance because she has hopes of a reunion with her first lover, a Pole who abandoned her years earlier. Discovering that Grushenka has unexpectedly left home one evening, Dmitri suspects that she has gone to Fyodor’s house. Frenzied, he snatches up a pestle and rushes off to his father’s house. Catching sight of him in an open window, Dmitri feels such revulsion that he is on the verge of striking him, but, at the last moment, he restrains himself. Running away from the house, Dmitri is seized by his father’s servant Grigory. Dmitri hits Grigory with the pestle and, believing him to be dead, leaves him behind.

Dmitri learns that Grushenka has gone to an inn in a nearby town to meet her former lover. Dmitri follows her there, planning to see her one more time before he kills himself. Once there, however, he realizes that Grushenka has become disenchanted with the Pole, and she and Dmitri declare their love for each other. Dmitri is torn between joy over his newfound love with Grushenka and grief over the thought that he has killed Grigory. The police arrive and charge Dmitri with murder, not of Grigory but of Fyodor. Grigory’s wound was not fatal, but Fyodor was found brutally murdered. Dmitri is interrogated at length and then is allowed to sleep briefly. He has a vivid dream featuring a mother with a suffering child, and he feels a deep determination to help. He awakens with a new sense of resolve. He declares that he is ready to accept...

Pride and Prejudice is set in rural England in the early 19th century, and it follows the Bennet family, which includes five very different sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious to see all her daughters married, especially as the modest family estate is to be inherited by William Collins when Mr. Bennet dies. At a ball, the wealthy and newly arrived Charles Bingley takes an immediate interest in the eldest Bennet daughter, the beautiful and shy Jane. The encounter between his friend Darcy and Elizabeth is less cordial. Although Austen shows them intrigued by each other, she reverses the convention of first impressions: pride of rank and fortune and prejudice against the social inferiority of Elizabeth’s family hold Darcy aloof, while Elizabeth is equally fired both by the pride of self-respect and by prejudice against Darcy’s snobbery.
The pompous Collins subsequently arrives, hoping to marry one of the Bennet sisters. Elizabeth, however, refuses his offer of marriage, and he instead becomes engaged to her friend Charlotte Lucas. During this time, Elizabeth encounters the charming George Wickham, a military officer. There is a mutual attraction between the two, and he informs her that Darcy has denied him his inheritance.
After Bingley abruptly departs for London, Elizabeth’s dislike of Darcy increases as she becomes convinced that he is discouraging Bingley’s relationship with Jane. Darcy, however, has grown increasingly fond of Elizabeth, admiring her intelligence and vitality. While visiting the now-married Charlotte, Elizabeth sees Darcy, who professes his love for her and proposes. A surprised Elizabeth refuses his offer, and, when Darcy demands an explanation, she accuses him of breaking up Jane and Bingley. Darcy subsequently writes Elizabeth a letter in which he explains that he separated the couple largely because he did not believe Jane returned Bingley’s affection. He also discloses that Wickham, after squandering his inheritance, tried to marry Darcy’s then 15-year-old sister in an attempt to gain possession of her fortune. With these revelations, Elizabeth begins to see Darcy in a new light.
Shortly thereafter the youngest Bennet sister, Lydia, elopes with Wickham. The news is met with great alarm by Elizabeth, since the scandalous affair—which is unlikely to end in marriage—could ruin the reputation of the other Bennet sisters. When she tells Darcy, he persuades Wickham to marry Lydia, offering him money. Despite Darcy’s attempt to keep his intervention a secret, Elizabeth learns of his actions. At the encouragement of Darcy, Bingley subsequently returns, and he and Jane become engaged. Finally, Darcy proposes again to Elizabeth, who this time accepts.",Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen, , ,Random House Publishing Group,9780553213102,"1st Edition,2015", ,India,English

In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.

Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys’s claim to Westeros forever.

Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone—a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.

From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.",A Dance with Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire),George R. R.

Robert and his family are a prime example of a perfect family. However, Robert was unfaithful to his wife on one occasion, and had a brief affair with another woman during his business trip to France. Robert was unaware that his affair resulted in the birth of a baby boy. One day, Robert is contacted by his friend in France, who gave him shocking news about the passing away of the woman he had an affair with. Things get complicated when he is told about Jean-Claude, who is his son from that woman, and is now an orphan.

Robert finds himself in a mess, but somehow manages to confide in his wife Sheila, who takes the matter in her stride, and is willing to have Jean-Claude over for the summer. The couple agree to keep the true identity of the boy a secret. Sheila, who is a journalist, finds herself in a spot where she is tempted to have an affair with an author she was interviewing. In the meantime, their two daughters get to know the truth about Jean-Claude from Robert’s friends’ son, and don’t want to speak to their parents.

When the family decide to send Jean-Claude back to France by flight, he falls ill suddenly and is hospitalized. How will the family react to this? Will they still be at loggerheads with each other or will they accept Jean-Claude for who he is? This book answers these questions and more.

The phrase has its origin in this book. Set in the time of the Second World War, the story of Catch-22 is centered around characters stationed  in an island in the Mediterranean Sea. The island of Pianosa is home to the 256th squadron, which includes the central character, Captain John Yossarian.
The story is told from a third-person perspective, and so it moves from one person to the next, providing different view points according to each person’s character.

Captain Yossarian is a young man who believes very practically that his life is important and the results of a war do not matter to a man who is dead. He tries his best to keep from going on flying missions by faking illness. But his efforts are countered by Colonel Cathcart. He constantly increases the number missions an airman must fly to complete his service.

Yossarian desperately tries to avoid flying more missions because, as he puts it, when he flies to drop bombs on people, so many people he has not even met are trying to kill him.

Catch-22 is a hilariously funny satire about war, the higher command in the military and bureaucracy in general. The books title, Catch-22, is a clause in the military rules. Yossarian sees it with reference to his friend Orr. The rule is self-contradictory and leads to a circular logic that cannot provide a solution.
The rule states that if a person continues to fly on dangerous missions, he is insane and can be relieved of duty. On this premise, Orr is crazy; so he can get grounded. But, there is a catch: the rule also says that a concern for personal safety when faced with dangers that are real and immediate was a reflection of a sane mind. So, if Orr asked to be relieved, he would no longer be considered crazy, and hence will have to continue flying more missions.",Catch - 22,Joseph Heller, , ,Random House Publishing Group,9780099536017,"1st Edition,1994",570,India,English

The plot of The Brothers Karamazov revolves around the murder of Fyodor Karamazov, a grasping Russian landowner with three legitimate children—Dmitri, Ivan, and Alyosha. Each son has a dominant personality trait: Dmitri possesses broad passions, Ivan is a cool intellectual, and Alyosha has a spiritual orientation. Another member of the Karamazov household, a servant named Pavel Smerdyakov, is rumored to be Fyodor’s illegitimate son, and he emanates corrosive malevolence.

As the novel opens, Fyodor and Dmitri are in competition for the affections of a young woman named Grushenka. Although Dmitri is betrothed to Katerina Ivanovna, a proud woman of the gentry, he has fallen madly in love with Grushenka, but Grushenka keeps both Dmitri and Fyodor at a distance because she has hopes of a reunion with her first lover, a Pole who abandoned her years earlier. Discovering that Grushenka has unexpectedly left home one evening, Dmitri suspects that she has gone to Fyodor’s house. Frenzied, he snatches up a pestle and rushes off to his father’s house. Catching sight of him in an open window, Dmitri feels such revulsion that he is on the verge of striking him, but, at the last moment, he restrains himself. Running away from the house, Dmitri is seized by his father’s servant Grigory. Dmitri hits Grigory with the pestle and, believing him to be dead, leaves him behind.

Dmitri learns that Grushenka has gone to an inn in a nearby town to meet her former lover. Dmitri follows her there, planning to see her one more time before he kills himself. Once there, however, he realizes that Grushenka has become disenchanted with the Pole, and she and Dmitri declare their love for each other. Dmitri is torn between joy over his newfound love with Grushenka and grief over the thought that he has killed Grigory. The police arrive and charge Dmitri with murder, not of Grigory but of Fyodor. Grigory’s wound was not fatal, but Fyodor was found brutally murdered. Dmitri is interrogated at length and then is allowed to sleep briefly. He has a vivid dream featuring a mother with a suffering child, and he feels a deep determination to help. He awakens with a new sense of resolve. He declares that he is ready to accept...

Pride and Prejudice is set in rural England in the early 19th century, and it follows the Bennet family, which includes five very different sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious to see all her daughters married, especially as the modest family estate is to be inherited by William Collins when Mr. Bennet dies. At a ball, the wealthy and newly arrived Charles Bingley takes an immediate interest in the eldest Bennet daughter, the beautiful and shy Jane. The encounter between his friend Darcy and Elizabeth is less cordial. Although Austen shows them intrigued by each other, she reverses the convention of first impressions: pride of rank and fortune and prejudice against the social inferiority of Elizabeth’s family hold Darcy aloof, while Elizabeth is equally fired both by the pride of self-respect and by prejudice against Darcy’s snobbery.
The pompous Collins subsequently arrives, hoping to marry one of the Bennet sisters. Elizabeth, however, refuses his offer of marriage, and he instead becomes engaged to her friend Charlotte Lucas. During this time, Elizabeth encounters the charming George Wickham, a military officer. There is a mutual attraction between the two, and he informs her that Darcy has denied him his inheritance.
After Bingley abruptly departs for London, Elizabeth’s dislike of Darcy increases as she becomes convinced that he is discouraging Bingley’s relationship with Jane. Darcy, however, has grown increasingly fond of Elizabeth, admiring her intelligence and vitality. While visiting the now-married Charlotte, Elizabeth sees Darcy, who professes his love for her and proposes. A surprised Elizabeth refuses his offer, and, when Darcy demands an explanation, she accuses him of breaking up Jane and Bingley. Darcy subsequently writes Elizabeth a letter in which he explains that he separated the couple largely because he did not believe Jane returned Bingley’s affection. He also discloses that Wickham, after squandering his inheritance, tried to marry Darcy’s then 15-year-old sister in an attempt to gain possession of her fortune. With these revelations, Elizabeth begins to see Darcy in a new light.
Shortly thereafter the youngest Bennet sister, Lydia, elopes with Wickham. The news is met with great alarm by Elizabeth, since the scandalous affair—which is unlikely to end in marriage—could ruin the reputation of the other Bennet sisters. When she tells Darcy, he persuades Wickham to marry Lydia, offering him money. Despite Darcy’s attempt to keep his intervention a secret, Elizabeth learns of his actions. At the encouragement of Darcy, Bingley subsequently returns, and he and Jane become engaged. Finally, Darcy proposes again to Elizabeth, who this time accepts.",Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen, , ,Random House Publishing Group,9780553213102,"1st Edition,2015", ,India,English

In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.

Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys’s claim to Westeros forever.

Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone—a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.

From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.",A Dance with Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire),George R. R.

Robert and his family are a prime example of a perfect family. However, Robert was unfaithful to his wife on one occasion, and had a brief affair with another woman during his business trip to France. Robert was unaware that his affair resulted in the birth of a baby boy. One day, Robert is contacted by his friend in France, who gave him shocking news about the passing away of the woman he had an affair with. Things get complicated when he is told about Jean-Claude, who is his son from that woman, and is now an orphan.

Robert finds himself in a mess, but somehow manages to confide in his wife Sheila, who takes the matter in her stride, and is willing to have Jean-Claude over for the summer. The couple agree to keep the true identity of the boy a secret. Sheila, who is a journalist, finds herself in a spot where she is tempted to have an affair with an author she was interviewing. In the meantime, their two daughters get to know the truth about Jean-Claude from Robert’s friends’ son, and don’t want to speak to their parents.

When the family decide to send Jean-Claude back to France by flight, he falls ill suddenly and is hospitalized. How will the family react to this? Will they still be at loggerheads with each other or will they accept Jean-Claude for who he is? This book answers these questions and more.

About Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a novelist, poet, physician, and short story writer, who was a native of Edinburgh, Scotland. He has authored numerous literary works. Some of the books written by him are The Lost World, The Poison Belt, The Parasite, and The Maracot Deep. Doyle was a prolific writer, often using elements of fantasy and science fiction in his writing.

Apart from writing, Doyle was also a trained physician and an avid football player. He was also friends with notable people such as Harry Houdini, Joseph McCabe, and Richard Milner. He was married twice, and fathered five children. Following the death of his second wife, a few family members, and his son, Doyle sank into deep depression.

He passed away in 1930 at the age of 71, after suffering a heart attack.","The complete Sherlock Holmes (Box Set)(Volume I,II)",Sir Arthur Connan Doyle, , ,Random House Publishing Group,9780553328257,"1st Edition,1986",1796,India,English

The phrase has its origin in this book. Set in the time of the Second World War, the story of Catch-22 is centered around characters stationed  in an island in the Mediterranean Sea. The island of Pianosa is home to the 256th squadron, which includes the central character, Captain John Yossarian.
The story is told from a third-person perspective, and so it moves from one person to the next, providing different view points according to each person’s character.

Captain Yossarian is a young man who believes very practically that his life is important and the results of a war do not matter to a man who is dead. He tries his best to keep from going on flying missions by faking illness. But his efforts are countered by Colonel Cathcart. He constantly increases the number missions an airman must fly to complete his service.

Yossarian desperately tries to avoid flying more missions because, as he puts it, when he flies to drop bombs on people, so many people he has not even met are trying to kill him.

Catch-22 is a hilariously funny satire about war, the higher command in the military and bureaucracy in general. The books title, Catch-22, is a clause in the military rules. Yossarian sees it with reference to his friend Orr. The rule is self-contradictory and leads to a circular logic that cannot provide a solution.
The rule states that if a person continues to fly on dangerous missions, he is insane and can be relieved of duty. On this premise, Orr is crazy; so he can get grounded. But, there is a catch: the rule also says that a concern for personal safety when faced with dangers that are real and immediate was a reflection of a sane mind. So, if Orr asked to be relieved, he would no longer be considered crazy, and hence will have to continue flying more missions.",Catch - 22,Joseph Heller, , ,Random House Publishing Group,9780099536017,"1st Edition,1994",570,India,English

The plot of The Brothers Karamazov revolves around the murder of Fyodor Karamazov, a grasping Russian landowner with three legitimate children—Dmitri, Ivan, and Alyosha. Each son has a dominant personality trait: Dmitri possesses broad passions, Ivan is a cool intellectual, and Alyosha has a spiritual orientation. Another member of the Karamazov household, a servant named Pavel Smerdyakov, is rumored to be Fyodor’s illegitimate son, and he emanates corrosive malevolence.

As the novel opens, Fyodor and Dmitri are in competition for the affections of a young woman named Grushenka. Although Dmitri is betrothed to Katerina Ivanovna, a proud woman of the gentry, he has fallen madly in love with Grushenka, but Grushenka keeps both Dmitri and Fyodor at a distance because she has hopes of a reunion with her first lover, a Pole who abandoned her years earlier. Discovering that Grushenka has unexpectedly left home one evening, Dmitri suspects that she has gone to Fyodor’s house. Frenzied, he snatches up a pestle and rushes off to his father’s house. Catching sight of him in an open window, Dmitri feels such revulsion that he is on the verge of striking him, but, at the last moment, he restrains himself. Running away from the house, Dmitri is seized by his father’s servant Grigory. Dmitri hits Grigory with the pestle and, believing him to be dead, leaves him behind.

Dmitri learns that Grushenka has gone to an inn in a nearby town to meet her former lover. Dmitri follows her there, planning to see her one more time before he kills himself. Once there, however, he realizes that Grushenka has become disenchanted with the Pole, and she and Dmitri declare their love for each other. Dmitri is torn between joy over his newfound love with Grushenka and grief over the thought that he has killed Grigory. The police arrive and charge Dmitri with murder, not of Grigory but of Fyodor. Grigory’s wound was not fatal, but Fyodor was found brutally murdered. Dmitri is interrogated at length and then is allowed to sleep briefly. He has a vivid dream featuring a mother with a suffering child, and he feels a deep determination to help. He awakens with a new sense of resolve. He declares that he is ready to accept...

Pride and Prejudice is set in rural England in the early 19th century, and it follows the Bennet family, which includes five very different sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious to see all her daughters married, especially as the modest family estate is to be inherited by William Collins when Mr. Bennet dies. At a ball, the wealthy and newly arrived Charles Bingley takes an immediate interest in the eldest Bennet daughter, the beautiful and shy Jane. The encounter between his friend Darcy and Elizabeth is less cordial. Although Austen shows them intrigued by each other, she reverses the convention of first impressions: pride of rank and fortune and prejudice against the social inferiority of Elizabeth’s family hold Darcy aloof, while Elizabeth is equally fired both by the pride of self-respect and by prejudice against Darcy’s snobbery.
The pompous Collins subsequently arrives, hoping to marry one of the Bennet sisters. Elizabeth, however, refuses his offer of marriage, and he instead becomes engaged to her friend Charlotte Lucas. During this time, Elizabeth encounters the charming George Wickham, a military officer. There is a mutual attraction between the two, and he informs her that Darcy has denied him his inheritance.
After Bingley abruptly departs for London, Elizabeth’s dislike of Darcy increases as she becomes convinced that he is discouraging Bingley’s relationship with Jane. Darcy, however, has grown increasingly fond of Elizabeth, admiring her intelligence and vitality. While visiting the now-married Charlotte, Elizabeth sees Darcy, who professes his love for her and proposes. A surprised Elizabeth refuses his offer, and, when Darcy demands an explanation, she accuses him of breaking up Jane and Bingley. Darcy subsequently writes Elizabeth a letter in which he explains that he separated the couple largely because he did not believe Jane returned Bingley’s affection. He also discloses that Wickham, after squandering his inheritance, tried to marry Darcy’s then 15-year-old sister in an attempt to gain possession of her fortune. With these revelations, Elizabeth begins to see Darcy in a new light.
Shortly thereafter the youngest Bennet sister, Lydia, elopes with Wickham. The news is met with great alarm by Elizabeth, since the scandalous affair—which is unlikely to end in marriage—could ruin the reputation of the other Bennet sisters. When she tells Darcy, he persuades Wickham to marry Lydia, offering him money. Despite Darcy’s attempt to keep his intervention a secret, Elizabeth learns of his actions. At the encouragement of Darcy, Bingley subsequently returns, and he and Jane become engaged. Finally, Darcy proposes again to Elizabeth, who this time accepts.",Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen, , ,Random House Publishing Group,9780553213102,"1st Edition,2015", ,India,English

In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.

Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys’s claim to Westeros forever.

Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone—a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.

From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.",A Dance with Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire),George R. R.

The story revolves around three extraordinary characters, Timothy, Daniel, and Deborah. The story is about two people who belong to two different worlds who met in their childhood. After their first meeting, they are destined to cross each other’s path throughout. The leading character of the story, Daniel, is the son of a rabbi. Being a scholar himself, he is fated to follow his father’s footsteps and yet break his father’s heart. Timothy is the one who had been abandoned at birth and yet is lucky enough to find a home at the Catholic Church. At this Church, he is also offered an alluring career but the vows he takes at the Church are not strong enough to hold him back from a soul igniting passion. Deborah, the third main character, has been given an upbringing to be dutiful and obedient. She is supposed to be a perfect rabbi’s wife, and she is until she falls in love, a forbidden love that leads her to another world of rebellion. The book takes the reader through various cities including Brooklyn and Brasilia, and the holy cities of Rome and Jerusalem. The story stretches over a time period of a quarter of a century.

Robert and his family are a prime example of a perfect family. However, Robert was unfaithful to his wife on one occasion, and had a brief affair with another woman during his business trip to France. Robert was unaware that his affair resulted in the birth of a baby boy. One day, Robert is contacted by his friend in France, who gave him shocking news about the passing away of the woman he had an affair with. Things get complicated when he is told about Jean-Claude, who is his son from that woman, and is now an orphan.

Robert finds himself in a mess, but somehow manages to confide in his wife Sheila, who takes the matter in her stride, and is willing to have Jean-Claude over for the summer. The couple agree to keep the true identity of the boy a secret. Sheila, who is a journalist, finds herself in a spot where she is tempted to have an affair with an author she was interviewing. In the meantime, their two daughters get to know the truth about Jean-Claude from Robert’s friends’ son, and don’t want to speak to their parents.

When the family decide to send Jean-Claude back to France by flight, he falls ill suddenly and is hospitalized. How will the family react to this? Will they still be at loggerheads with each other or will they accept Jean-Claude for who he is? This book answers these questions and more.

In 1983, Shekhar Kapur directed the second adaptation of this novel, entitled Masoom. In 1984, Sophan Sophiaan released the third adaptation of this novel, which was in Indonesian.
