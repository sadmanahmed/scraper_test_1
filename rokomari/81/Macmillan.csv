Originally published in 1975, Modern Microeconomics 2e,Koutsoyiannis helps the reader examine the decisions and behaviour of economic units, which influence the supply and demand for goods and services, which in turn, determine prices and vice-versa. The text uses traditional microeconomic theory as a starting point to this analysis before culminating in a study of oligopoly, which is a market form that is dominated by a limited number of sellers.

The book analyses market mechanisms that influence allocation of resources amongst their many uses as well as the factors that influence prices of goods and services by examining the theory of factor pricing, general equilibrium theory, welfare theory, and price theory. Koutsoyiannis uses diagrams extensively to illustrate her explanation of microeconomic theory thereby providing for easy readability and comprehension.

Modern Microeconomics 2e,Koutsoyiannis is considered an important text among standard microeconomic textbooks for its treatment of oligopoly as the norm rather than the exception in the modern industrial world. It is written at an intermediate level and is designed for undergraduate economics courses. It is also of use to postgraduate students and individuals preparing for national competitive exams.

Zamzama is a posh locality in Karachi, Pakistan. Certainly not a place anyone would have expected American journalist Jon Friedland to go missing. But when he does, the government goes into panic. The American President is due to visit in a few weeks and the event could rock the already fragile relations between the countries. When they find themselves at their wit’s end, they make a bargain with Akbar Khan, a Deputy Superintendent of Police who is currently serving a sentence for crimes he didn’t commit. Between Khan ""The Prisoner"" and his friend and former colleague, Constantine D’Souza ""The Jailer,"" the story tells us about their lives in the Pakistan Police Force.

But despite what the press seems to think, Mia has more on her mind than recruiting a new Prince Charming. Like solving a 400-year-old mystery that could mean BIG changes for little Genovia. But is Mia really ready to throw away her tiara especially if it means destroying a dynasty?

About the Author
Meg Cabot was born in Bloomington, Indiana. As a young girl Meg whiled away many hours, reading the complete works of Jane Austen, Judy Blume, and Barbara Cartland.

Armed with a fine arts degree from Indiana University, Meg moved to New York City, intent upon pursuing a career in freelance illustration. Illustrating, however, soon got in the way of Meg's true love, writing, and so she abandoned it and got a job as the assistant manager of an undergraduate dormitory at New York University, writing whenever she had the chance.

The first of her many historical romance novels were written under the name Patricia Cabot.

Film rights to The Princess Diaries were sold to Disney, and a feature length film based on the book was released in August 2001. Film rights to All-American Girl and The Mediatorseries also went to Disney.

Meggin now writes full time, and lives in New York City with her husband and their one-eyed cat, Henrietta.",The Princess Diaries to the Nines,Meg Cabot, , ,Macmillan,9780330448550,"1st Edition,2008",240,India,English

Originally published in 1975, Modern Microeconomics 2e,Koutsoyiannis helps the reader examine the decisions and behaviour of economic units, which influence the supply and demand for goods and services, which in turn, determine prices and vice-versa. The text uses traditional microeconomic theory as a starting point to this analysis before culminating in a study of oligopoly, which is a market form that is dominated by a limited number of sellers.

The book analyses market mechanisms that influence allocation of resources amongst their many uses as well as the factors that influence prices of goods and services by examining the theory of factor pricing, general equilibrium theory, welfare theory, and price theory. Koutsoyiannis uses diagrams extensively to illustrate her explanation of microeconomic theory thereby providing for easy readability and comprehension.

Modern Microeconomics 2e,Koutsoyiannis is considered an important text among standard microeconomic textbooks for its treatment of oligopoly as the norm rather than the exception in the modern industrial world. It is written at an intermediate level and is designed for undergraduate economics courses. It is also of use to postgraduate students and individuals preparing for national competitive exams.

Zamzama is a posh locality in Karachi, Pakistan. Certainly not a place anyone would have expected American journalist Jon Friedland to go missing. But when he does, the government goes into panic. The American President is due to visit in a few weeks and the event could rock the already fragile relations between the countries. When they find themselves at their wit’s end, they make a bargain with Akbar Khan, a Deputy Superintendent of Police who is currently serving a sentence for crimes he didn’t commit. Between Khan ""The Prisoner"" and his friend and former colleague, Constantine D’Souza ""The Jailer,"" the story tells us about their lives in the Pakistan Police Force.

About the Author
Meg Cabot was born in Bloomington, Indiana. As a young girl Meg whiled away many hours, reading the complete works of Jane Austen, Judy Blume, and Barbara Cartland.

Armed with a fine arts degree from Indiana University, Meg moved to New York City, intent upon pursuing a career in freelance illustration. Illustrating, however, soon got in the way of Meg's true love, writing, and so she abandoned it and got a job as the assistant manager of an undergraduate dormitory at New York University, writing whenever she had the chance.

The first of her many historical romance novels were written under the name Patricia Cabot.

Film rights to The Princess Diaries were sold to Disney, and a feature length film based on the book was released in August 2001. Film rights to All-American Girl and The Mediatorseries also went to Disney.

Meggin now writes full time, and lives in New York City with her husband and their one-eyed cat, Henrietta.",The Princess Diaries to the Nines,Meg Cabot, , ,Macmillan,9780330448550,"1st Edition,2008",240,India,English

As a blizzard whips out of the north on Christmas Eve, several people converge on a remote family house. Stanley Oxenford, director of a pharmaceutical research company, has everything riding on a drug he is developing to fight a lethal virus. Several others are interested in his success too: his children, at home for Christmas with their offspring, have their eyes on the money he will make; Toni Gallo, head of his security team and recently forced to resign from the police, is betting her career on keeping it safe; an ambitious local television reporter sniffs a story, even if he has to bend the facts to tell it; and a violent trio of thugs are on their way to steal it, with a client already waiting. As the storm worsens and the group is laid under siege by the elements, the emotional sparks crackle and dark secrets are revealed that threaten to drive Stanley and his family apart for ever. Filled with startling twists, ""Whiteout"" is the ultimate knife-edge drama from an international bestselling author who is in a class by himself. 'Few writers can come up with the thrills more effectively than Ken Follett' - ""Guardian"". 'A new breed of thriller...Follett drags readers to the very edge of their seats and holds them captive until the very last villain is satisfactorily dispatched' - ""Publishers weekly.""",Whiteout,Ken Follett, , ,Macmillan,9780330490696,"1st Edition,2005",400,India,English
