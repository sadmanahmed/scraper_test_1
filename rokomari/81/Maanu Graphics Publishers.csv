There were 118 limited edition copies which were given to many of America's most successful individuals, all of whom had contributed to the content of the book. Orne Publishing used one of these original copies to create a reprinted version of The Law of Success in 2010.The Book of 16 lessons that make up the text:
A Definite Purpose
Lesson 1 ""A Definite Purpose"" teaches readers how to save the wasted effort which the majority of people expend in trying to find their life-work. This lesson aims to show how to do away forever with aimlessness, to fix one's heart, and to land upon some definite, well-conceived purpose as a life-work.

Self-Confidence
Lesson 2 ""Self-Confidence"" describes how to master the six basic fears with which every person is cursed: the fear of Poverty, the fear of Ill Health, the fear of Old Age, the fear of Criticism, the fear of Loss of Love of Someone, and the fear of Death. It teaches the difference between egotism and real self-confidence which is based upon definite, usable knowledge.

Initiative and leadership
Lesson 3 ""Initiative and leadership"" shows how to become a leader instead of a follower in one's chosen field of endeavor. It helps develop in readers the instinct for leadership which will purportedly cause them to gravitate to the top in all undertakings in which they participate.

Imagination
Lesson 4 ""Imagination"" discusses stimulating one's mind so that one will conceive new ideas and develop new plans to help in attaining the object of the reader's Definite Chief Aim. This lesson teaches how to ""build new homes out of old stones"", so to speak. It shows how to create new ideas out of old, well known concepts and how to put old ideas to new uses. This one lesson alone is reportedly the equivalent of a very practical course in salesmanship.

Action
Lesson 5 ""Action"" shows how actions powered with clear purpose and strong leadership yields desired results.

Enthusiasm
Lesson 6 ""Enthusiasm"" allows readers to ""saturate"" all with whom they come in contact with interest in the reader and their ideas. Enthusiasm is the foundation of a Pleasing Personality, and it is important in order to influence others to co-operate.

Self-Control
Lesson 7 ""Self-Control"" is the ""balance wheel"" with which people control their enthusiasm and direct it where they wish it to carry them. This lesson provides practical insights to help readers take control of their lives.

Habit of Performing More Service than Paid For
Lesson 8 
""The Habit Of rendering More Service than Paid For"" is one of the most important lessons of the Law of Success course. The lesson teaches how to take advantage of the Law of Increasing Returns, which will eventually ensure a return in money far out of proportion to the service one renders. It advances the notion that no one may become a real leader in any walk of life without practicing the habit of doing more work and better work than that for which they are paid.

Attractive personality
Lesson 9 ""Attractive Personality"" is the ""fulcrum"" on which it is suggested that readers place the ""crow-bar"" of their efforts, and when so placed, with intelligence, it will enable them to remove mountains of obstacles. This lesson claims to have made scores of Master Salesmen. It teaches how to transform one's personality so that one may adapt oneself to any environment -- or to any other personality -- in such a manner that the reader may easily dominate a situation.

Accurate thought
Lesson 10 ""Accurate Thought"" is described as one of the important foundation stones of all enduring success. This lesson teaches how to separate ""facts"" from mere ""information,"" and also teaches how to organize known facts into two classes: the ""important"" and the ""unimportant."" It teaches how to determine what is an ""important"" fact, and how to build definite working plans in the pursuit of any calling out of facts. It illustrates how the eyes of an accurate thinker see only facts and not delusions of prejudice, hate, or envy. It explains how accurate thought depends on deductive reasoning and creative thought.

Concentration
Lesson 11 ""Concentration"" teaches how to focus attention upon one subject at a time until it is mastered and its knowledge has been put into operation. The lesson gives techniques on how to ensure one's focus remains on one's goals until they are completed.

Tolerance
Lesson 12 ""Tolerance"" teaches how to avoid the disastrous effects of racial and religious prejudices which mean defeat for millions of people who permit themselves to become entangled in foolish argument over these subjects, thereby poisoning their own minds and closing the door to reason and investigation. This lesson is the twin sister of the one on Accurate Thought, for the reason that no one may become an Accurate Thinker without practicing tolerance. Intolerance closes the book of knowledge and writes on the cover, ""Finished, I have learned it all!"" Intolerance makes enemies of those who should be friends. It destroys opportunity and fills the mind with doubt, mistrust and prejudice.

Failure
Lesson 13 ""Failure"" teaches how to make stepping stones out of all of past and future mistakes and failures. It teaches the difference between ""failures"" and ""temporary defeat."" It teaches how to profit by failures and from the failures of other people.

Cooperation
Lesson 14 ""Cooperation"" teaches the value of team-work in all one does. This lesson teaches readers how to apply the law of the ""Master Mind"" described in the Introduction and in Lesson 2 of the course. This lesson shows how to co-ordinate one's own efforts with those of others in such a manner that friction, jealousy, strife, envy, and cupidity will be eliminated. Readers learn how to make use of all that other people have learned about the work in which they are engaged.

Habit of saving
Lesson 15 The ""habit of saving"" is an important law of success. Savings are created when you spend less than you earn. Napoleon believed that saving is only a matter of habit. Habit builds the walls of limitation.

The Golden Rule
Lesson 16 The Golden Rule teaches how to make use of the great universal law of human conduct in such a manner that achieves harmonious co-operation from any individual or group of individuals. Lack of understanding of the law upon which the Golden Rule philosophy is reportedly based is one of the major causes of failure of millions of people who remain in misery, poverty, and want all their lives.",Red Book Of : The Law Of Success,Napoleon Hill, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789380078311,1st Edition,224,India,English

Humans evolved language as a powerful tool and have been using it effectively for long. Body language is a big part of animal communication and humans have it too. They reveal through many gestures, postures and action thoughts that are not revealed in speech.
Body Language: How To Read Others’ Thoughts By Their Gestures shows how these can be noted and interpreted to get a true picture of the other person’s attitudes and intentions. Words can hide as much as they reveal. People have learned to control speech and writing to manipulate the other person’s response.
However, body language is more natural and subconscious. People may not even be aware that they are giving off signs that reveal their true thoughts. Learning to notice these is the key to being a good communicator.
Written by the author after several years of research, the book provides a lot of insights into the subtle signals that the body gives off while talking. He explains how legs might reveal what a person actually wants to do, how handshakes can be used to assert power and control, how a smile can create a good impression.
He also explains the common gestures of liars and the common gestures that each sex uses during courtship. Interestingly, he also discusses the difference gestures used by people in different age groups in the same situation. He says that gestures and postures get more subtle as the person grows older and learns to control their body language.
Body Language: How To Read Others’ Thoughts By Their Gestures also shows how to use body signals and cues to communicate more effectively, how to control them to manipulate other people.

The Work of a Lifetime
Andrew Carnegie, the founder of a steel corporation that later helped form U.S. Steel and a great philanthropist, charged the young Napoleon Hill with what was to be his life's work: the assembling and analyzing of the qualities that had allowed the great figures of the early United States to achieve their lasting success. Armed only with introductions from Carnegie and a fierce determination, Hill set out to interview more than five hundred of these titans and distill their philosophies into a logical framework. 
From men such as Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Woodrow Wilson, and later Franklin Roosevelt, Hill gained invaluable insights. He also learned about the limitations each faced: He found Ford personally insufferable; he encountered and understood Edison's struggles with near deafness; and though he worked hard for FDR during the Great Depression to combat the national malaise, he disagreed strongly with many of the President's programs. Hill believed they placed too little emphasis on individual effort and lured Americans into relying on others, instead of on themselves. But by observing, working, and talking with these people, Hill learned priceless lessons that were much greater than the sum of his subjects' accomplishments. 
Though Hill had already published a number of books which revealed his findings in broad detail and enjoyed commercial success, his crowning achievement was the publication of the all-time best-selling business inspirational book Think and Grow Rich in 1937. 
This clear, concise elucidation of the way to success was an immediate sensation. It lays out the techniques of personal achievement in everyday language, full of examples and exhortations. More than fifty years later, supported by the work of the Napoleon Hill Foundation, Napoleon Hill's masterwork still finds thousands of new admirers every year, people whose lives are infinitely changed for the better. 
Hill continued to refine his philosophy, sharpening his focus as his wisdom grew and as he met even more people whose lives had been built on the ideas he had outlined. The major outlet for his new knowledge was a veritable whirl-wind of speeches, lectures, and articles he prepared over the next thirty years. He spent his life spreading the gospel of success as directly and as personally as he could. 
Unfortunately so much of the additional intelligence that Napoleon Hill developed was not published in book form. While he persisted in speaking all through his vigorous retirement, the hundreds of thousands of people who discovered. Think and Group Rich after Hill's death in 1970 have not had the advantage of his guidance on the many more practical points he pursued after the book was written.
With this in mind, the trustees of the Napoleon Hill Foundation directed that the key elements of Hill's later inspiration be set forth in this book.",13 Keys To Success 13 Steps To Personal Achievement,Napoleon Hill, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789382677246,"1st Edition,2008",192,India,English

The step-by-step scientific approach to attracting financial and spiritual wealth

• This is the 100-year-old book that inspired Rhonda Byrne's bestselling The Secret

• Explains the precise series of practical steps that, if followed, guarantee prosperity

• Reveals the secrets that underlie today’s success and prosperity movements

In his bestselling book, Wallace D. Wattles explains that “universal mind” underlies and permeates all creation. Through the process of visualization we can engage the law of attraction--impressing our thoughts upon “formless substance” and bringing the desired object or circumstances into material form. The author emphasizes the critical importance of attitude: only by aligning ourselves with the positive forces of natural law can we gain unlimited access to the creative mind and its abundant rewards.

The Science of Getting Rich holds the secret to how economic and emotional security can be achieved in a practical, imaginative, and noncompetitive way, while maintaining a loving and harmonious relationship with all of life. By living in accordance with the positive principles outlined in this book, we can find our rightful place in the cosmic scheme and create for ourselves an environment in which to grow in wealth, wisdom, and happiness.


“There is a science of getting rich. It is an exact science, like algebra or arithmetic. There are certain laws which govern the process of acquiring riches. Once a person learns and obeys these laws, he will get rich with mathematical certainty.”

Darwin opens by saying that while on board the HMS Beagle as a naturalist in South America he made observations about the animals and the land which formed the foundation for what would become his theory of natural selection. He hopes this theory, which he will develop in this book sheds light on “the mystery of mysteries”, the origin of species.

Darwin tells how, when he returned home in 1837, he thought that he may have something worth investigating so he spends the next years accumulating and reflecting on information. In 1844 he writes a sketch of the conclusions that his research is pointing towards but he holds off expanding his ideas, instead researching further, for another 15 years.

He calls his work an abstract for a larger book which will take many more years to complete. He notes that he felt compelled to publish his work now after reading the manuscript of Alfred Russel Wallace, who had arrived at similar conclusions as Darwin and was about to publish his findings. As an abstract he notes that it may be incomplete, imperfect and at times lacking references, but that any questions which arise will be answered when he publishes his findings in full.

Darwin acknowledges that other naturalists have observed the relations between similar species but have attributed the cause of these changes exclusively to external conditions such as climate and food. He sees these causes as insufficient to account for the great variation in nature. In order to research what other forces could be at work he will look first at his research with domesticated plants and animals even though this was not a common practice of other naturalists.

The introduction closes with Darwin laying out in the arguments that each of the following chapters will explore in more detail. In particular he explains that traits may pass from one generation to the next, that into each generation more individuals will be born than can possibly survive and the ones that do survive will do so because of slight competitive advantages that they inherit and consequently pass on to their offspring. This natural selection is what, over time, causes some species to evolve, others to diverge and become their own unique species and others to become extinct. This being true, all species are in some manner related to each other and not independently created.

The Prince of Denmark, Hamlet is in Germany in pursuit of education. Suddenly he is called to Denmark to attain the funeral of his father. When he comes home, he is shocked to see his mother Gertrude already to his uncle, Claudius and he himself has declared the king. Claudius has neglected the fact that the rightful heir to the throne is Prince Hamlet. After observing the situation, Hamlet smells a rat and doubts his uncle.
One night, the ghost of his father visits Prince Hamlet and tells him that he was murdered by his uncle Claudius when he was in sleep. He further says that he was poured poison in his ears while in deep sleep. The ghost entrusts Hamlet with a work of revenge the murderer Claudius and leave Gertrude in the hand of Heaven.
Hamlet plans to put on the fake mask of madness in the castle so as to observe the interaction and get to the truth. But he discovers himself in the great confusion and bewilderment. As he is a philosophical Prince, he keeps on thinking and raises the existence of the ghost and its truth. His behavior is changed because of his confusion and becomes moody. He thinks of staging a play putting the same murder scene that the ghost has described to him. He adds the scene of the murder, calling it The Mousetrap, in the middle of the play The Murder of Gonzago. He had expected that if the ghost is right, then it scene would work on the king and he would certainly show some odd behavior. As expected, the king could not breathe and wants the light, so he leaves the room. Now, Hamlet is fully convinced that he is the real killer of his father. He vows to kill him, but the problem with him is that he is too conscious and thinks a lot. His thought and philosophy immobilize him.
His passive and reluctant act of taking revenge takes the lives of six innocent people. When Hamlet and the queen are in the private chamber, Polonius spies on them. Hamlet discovers this fact and stabs him. Hamlet is punished for killing Polonius and he is sent to England. There he is spied by his school friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. When he knows about this, he arranges the hanging of these two friends instead. When Ophelia, whom Hamlet loves, comes to know that Hamlet has killed her father Polonius, she becomes mad and dies singing sad songs. Laertes, her brother comes from France, witnesses the death of his father and sister, gets angry on Hamlet and both fight. Laertes has a poisoned sword with which he cuts Hamlet and Hamlet too gets the same poisoned sword and kills Laertes. Meanwhile, Hamlets gets the message that his mother dies eating the toast form the poisoned bowl that is intended for Hamlet by Claudius. Before Laertes dies, he tells that Claudius is responsible for the death of Queen Gertrude as the poison is kept in the cup by Claudius. In anger, HhhHamlet stabs the poisoned sword and pours the last poisoned drink from the cup on his throat. Hamlet is at the last moment of his life as he is also cut by the poisoned sword. Before e his death, he declares that the throne must be given to the Prince Fortinbras of Norway. At the end of the play, the new appointed king of Denmark orders a royal funeral for the slain Prince Hamlet.",Hamlet,William Shakespeare, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9788190719049,"1st Edition,2012",176,India,English

The tales relate the adventures of several animal friends and neighbours in the English countryside—primarily Mole, Rat, Toad, and Badger. Although the animals converse, philosophize, and behave like humans, each creature also retains its distinctive animal habits. The story begins when Mole decides to go to the riverbank one morning rather than do his spring cleaning. There he comes across his friend Rat, a water rat, and they spend the spring and summer together. One day they visit the irrepressible, generous, and boastful Mr. Toad, owner of Toad Hall, who possesses large amounts of money but not much brain. Toad is given to fads, and Mole and Rat join him in an excursion in his present enthusiasm, a horse-drawn caravan (a cart with beds and cooking equipment), until a speeding automobile frightens the horse and wrecks the caravan. Toad is mesmerized by the car. Mole and Rat later go to the Wild Wood to visit the kindly and responsible Badger, to whom they report that Toad has bought and smashed several automobiles.

The three friends attempt an intervention, to prevent Toad from buying and wrecking more motorcars. Despite their efforts to contain him, Toad escapes, and, when he encounters an unattended car, he steals it. Inevitably, he is caught and sent to prison. However, the jailer’s daughter takes pity on him and helps him escape. After many further adventures, Toad is at last rescued by Rat. He learns that in his absence, Toad Hall has been taken over by weasels and stoats, but Badger knows that Toad Hall has a secret tunnel entrance, and the interlopers are evicted in a climactic battle, followed by a celebratory banquet.

Between Toad’s adventures, the other three main characters experience quieter events, notably in the lyrical chapters “The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,” in which the god Pan appears, unnamed, to help Mole and Rat find Otter’s lost child, and “Wayfarers All,” in which Rat is nearly hypnotized by the tales told by a sea rat.",The Wind In The Willows,Kenneth Grahame, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789381753576,"New Edition,2013",208,India,English

Her death barely affects Macbeth, who has received three new prophecies: to beware Macduff, that ""none of woman born"" shall harm him, and that he won't be defeated until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane Hill. Macbeth nearly assumes that he is invincible.


Macduff's forces camouflage themselves with foliage from Birnam Wood as they march on Dunsinane. Macduff, the product of a gruesome c-section, was not ""of woman born"" and thus has the power to defeat Macbeth, who realizes too late that the witches' prophecies foretold his death and not his success. Macduff kills Macbeth in the play's final act.",Macbeth,William Shakespeare, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9788190790512, ,120,India,English

The book Acres of Diamonds is one of the most famous books in the world. The author, Russell Conwell, was asked to give a speech to the 10 year reunion of his Civil War troops. He gave this speech as a result. It was then requested over and over again throughout the years.
It is fair to say this speech was given more times than any other speech in the history of the world. Russell Conwell personally gave this speech over 6,000 times, traveling from city to city. With the proceeds of the speech, he would pay for his room, board and train fare, then send the rest back to Temple University. These funds put nearly 2,000 students through college. 
Discover your very own Acres of Diamonds
The book details story after story of people overlooking riches in their own back yard, only to spend their time looking elsewhere. 
You owe it to yourself to read Acres of Diamonds. 
You can download the book for free by signing up for it in the upper left part of this page. 
I've added a workbook filled with questions on how you can discover your own Acres of Diamonds. 

The workbook grew out of helping hundreds of people look for their Acres of Diamonds.
There are a growing number of case studies as well of up to date examples of people finding or missing their own opportunities. 
In having coached hundreds of people over the years I've discovered some interesting things: 
* Most people under value what they know
* Most people think of themselves as ordinary and accept ordinary incomes and outcomes
* Once people are made aware of the value of what they know, they go on to be much more successful
* Once people wake-up to the possibilities of finding opportunities, they start to see them everywhere
It is not about making people greedy, focused on money. The people that talk about money the most are those that don't have it. 
Way too many people are going through life as paupers when they are standing just a few feet away from limitless wealth and success. Turn on the lights, take off the blinders, discover what diamonds look like in the rough. 
If you have to spend a lifetime working, work for higher wages. If you are going to start a business, find one that people are clamoring for. If you are going to strive to be successful, discover the success that is right in front of you.",Acres of Diamonds : The Brilliant Manifesto That Has Inspired Millions,Russell H.

Egeon, a merchant of Syracuse, is condemned to death in Ephesus for violating the ban against travel between the two rival cities. As he is led to his execution, he tells the Ephesian Duke, Solinus, that he has come to Syracuse in search of his wife and one of his twin sons, who were separated from him 25 years ago in a shipwreck. The other twin, who grew up with Egeon, is also traveling the world in search of the missing half of their family. (The twins, we learn, are identical, and each has an identical twin slave named Dromio.) The Duke is so moved by this story that he grants Egeon a day to raise the thousand-mark ransom that would be necessary to save his life.

Meanwhile, unknown to Egeon, his son Antipholus of Syracuse (and Antipholus' slave Dromio) is also visiting Ephesus--where Antipholus' missing twin, known as Antipholus of Ephesus, is a prosperous citizen of the city. Adriana, Antipholus of Ephesus' wife, mistakes Antipholus of Syracuse for her husband and drags him home for dinner, leaving Dromio of Syracuse to stand guard at the door and admit no one. Shortly thereafter, Antipholus of Ephesus (with his slave Dromio of Ephesus) returns home and is refused entry to his own house. Meanwhile, Antipholus of Syracuse has fallen in love with Luciana, Adriana's sister, who is appalled at the behavior of the man she thinks is her brother-in-law.

The confusion increases when a gold chain ordered by the Ephesian Antipholus is given to Antipholus of Syracuse. Antipholus of Ephesus refuses to pay for the chain (unsurprisingly, since he never received it) and is arrested for debt. His wife, seeing his strange behavior, decides he has gone mad and orders him bound and held in a cellar room. Meanwhile, Antipholus of Syracuse and his slave decide to flee the city, which they believe to be enchanted, as soon as possible--only to be menaced by Adriana and the debt officer. They seek refuge in a nearby abbey.

Adriana now begs the Duke to intervene and remove her ""husband"" from the abbey into her custody. Her real husband, meanwhile, has broken loose and now comes to the Duke and levels charges against his wife. The situation is finally resolved by the Abbess, Emilia, who brings out the set of twins and reveals herself to be Egeon's long-lost wife. Antipholus of Ephesus reconciles with Adriana; Egeon is pardoned by the Duke and reunited with his spouse; Antipholus of Syracuse resumes his romantic pursuit of Luciana, and all ends happily with the two Dromios embracing.",The Comedy Of Errors,William Shakespeare, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,978-9380078861,"1st Edition,2008",120,India,English

The first part narrates incidents of Gandhi's childhood, his experiments with eating meat, smoking, drinking, stealing and subsequent atonement. There are two texts that had a lasting influence on Gandhi, both of which he read in childhood. He records the profound impact of the play Harishchandra and says,""I read it with intense interest...It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number."" Another text he mentions reading that deeply affected him was Shravana Pitrabhakti Nataka, a play about Shravana's devotion to his parents. Gandhi got married at the age of 13. In his words, ""It is my painful duty to have to record here my marriage at the age of thirteen...I can see no moral argument in support of such a preposterously early marriage."" Another important event documented in this part is the demise of Gandhi's father Karamchand Gandhi. Gandhi wrote the book to deal with his experiment for truth. His disdain for physical training at school, particularly gymnastics has also been written about in this part.",An Autobiography Mahatma Gandhi : The Story of My Experiments With Truth,Mahatma Gandhi, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9788190690997, ,464,India,English

They have mastered the art of dealing with people! 

Let this book show you how to: 

*Achieve your goals
*Handle the human ego
*Become a master conversationalist
*Make others feel good about themselves
*And much more!

Skill with people is the one essential ingredient for success and happiness at home and in business. ""The Art of Dealing With People"" gives you the skills to take your people skills to a level that you never thought possible!

Skill in human relations is similar to skill in any other field, in that success depends on understanding and mastering certain basic general principles. You must not only know what to do, but why you're doing it.

As far as basic principles are concerned, people are all the same. Yet each individual person you meet is different. If you attempted to learn some gimmick to deal successfully with each separate individual you met, you would be face with a hopeless task.

Influencing people is an art, not a gimmick. When you apply gimmicks in a superficial, mechanical manner, you go through the same motions as the person who ""has a way,"" but it doesn't work for you.

The purpose of this book is to give you knowledge based upon an understanding of human nature: why people act the way they do. The methods presented in this book have been tested on thousands of people who have attended my human relations seminars. They are not just my pet ideas of how you should deal with people, but ideas that have stood the test of how you must deal with people. That is, if you want to get along with them and get what you want at the same time.

Yes, we all want success and happiness. And the day is long past, if it ever existed, when you could achieve these goals by forcing people to give you what you want. And begging is no better, for no one has respect for, or any desire to help, the person who constantly kowtows and literally goes around with his hand out, begging other people to like him.

The one successful way to get the things you want from life is to acquire skill in dealing with people. Read on and you will learn how.","Skill with people and the Art of Dealing with people (Achieve your goals,Handle the human ego,Become a master conversationalist)",Les Giblin, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789381753750, ,160,India,English

Born 1706 in Boston, Benjamin Franklin was the 15th of his father's 17 children. He went to school as a child with the intent of becoming a minister, as his father, Josiah, intended. However, that idea was dropped after Franklin showed a keen interest in reading and writing. He was apprenticed to his brother, James at a young age, but after fighting with his brother he quit the job and moved to Philadelphia, where he worked for a man named Samuel Keimer. After befriending some prominent political figures, including the royal Governor, Franklin left for England, where he spent 18 months working for a printer with his friend James Ralph, with whom he later became estranged. Shortly after returning to America in 1726, Franklin formed a debating club called the Junto. Two years later, he took over The Pennsylvania Gazette from Keimer and turned it into a successful publication with tools from London. In 1730, Franklin wed his old sweetheart, Deborah Read, with whom he had two children. The first, William Franklin, was born approximately one year later; he is the man to whom the Autobiography is addressed in Part One.

Throughout the 1730s, Franklin held some minor positions doing printing work for the government. In that time, he began Poor Richard's Almanac and became postmaster of Philadelphia. Towards the end of the decade, he invented the Franklin stove. In the 1740s, Franklin worked on several projects, including the fire brigade, the police force, the University of Pennsylvania, the street sweeping service and some other smaller public works projects. He retired from the printing business in 1748 and began to conduct scientific experiments in lightning. In 1753, he was awarded honorary degrees from Harvard and Yale, and he became Postmaster General of America. The following year, when war broke out between England and France (the French and Indian War Franklin began to draft proposals outlining means by which funds could be raised for colonial defense. He succeeded in many of his proposals, and he personally played a large part in organizing the war effort. The Autobiography, however, breaks off in 1757; it is left unfinished.

The Autobiography itself was written in three different times: 1771 in England, 1783-83 in France, and 1788 in America. If Franklin meant to complete it, he died before he got the chance.",The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,Benjamin Franklin, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789380078540, ,231,India,English

ABOUT THE BOOK
How to Live on 24 Hours a Day, written by Arnold Bennett, is part of a larger work entitled How to Live. In this volume, he offers practical advice on how one might live (as opposed to just existing) within the confines of 24 hours a day.
In the book, Bennett addressed the large and growing number of white-collar workers that had accumulated since the advent of the Industrial Revolution. In his view, these workers put in eight hours a day, 40 hours a week, at jobs they did not enjoy, and at worst hated. They worked to make a living, but their daily existence consisted of waking up, getting ready for work, working as little as possible during the work day, going home, unwinding, going to sleep, and repeating the process the next day. In short, he didn't believe they were really living.
Bennett addressed this problem by urging these “salarymen” to seize their extra time, and make the most of it to improve themselves. Extra time could be found at the beginning of the day, by waking up early, and on the ride to work, on the way home from work, in the evening hours, and especially during the weekends. During this time, he prescribed improvement measures such as reading great literature, taking an interest in the arts, reflecting on life, and learning self-discipline.","How To Live On 24 Hours A Day (The Key To a Fuller,Richer Life)",Arnold Bennett, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789381753101,"1st Edition,2013",112,India,English

“10 Day Of Her Life As Seen By David Colberet” Introduction: 
The short life of an ordinary schoolgirl may seem to be an unlikely subject for a biography. Yet when we read about Anne Frank, we defy what Nazi Germany hoped to achieve. The Holocaust was meant to be nameless-the Nazis tattooed numbers on most of their victims instead. Some of the world's first large. Computers, sold to the Nazis by the American company IBM, literally reduced the victims to old style computer punch cards. So the personal story of every Holocaust victim is an act of defiance simply because it's personal.
It's easy to quote statistics: six million Jews murdered-90 percent of the Jewish population of Poland, Germany, and other European countries. More than three million Poles, Slavs, Communists, Socialists, pacifist Christians, Gypsies (Roma), homo-sexuals, disabled, and people of African descent bring the total murdered to perhaps eleven million…",10 Day Of Her Life As Seen By David Colberet,Anne Frank, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789381753781, ,192,India,English

There were 118 limited edition copies which were given to many of America's most successful individuals, all of whom had contributed to the content of the book. Orne Publishing used one of these original copies to create a reprinted version of The Law of Success in 2010.The Book of 16 lessons that make up the text:
A Definite Purpose
Lesson 1 ""A Definite Purpose"" teaches readers how to save the wasted effort which the majority of people expend in trying to find their life-work. This lesson aims to show how to do away forever with aimlessness, to fix one's heart, and to land upon some definite, well-conceived purpose as a life-work.

Self-Confidence
Lesson 2 ""Self-Confidence"" describes how to master the six basic fears with which every person is cursed: the fear of Poverty, the fear of Ill Health, the fear of Old Age, the fear of Criticism, the fear of Loss of Love of Someone, and the fear of Death. It teaches the difference between egotism and real self-confidence which is based upon definite, usable knowledge.

Initiative and leadership
Lesson 3 ""Initiative and leadership"" shows how to become a leader instead of a follower in one's chosen field of endeavor. It helps develop in readers the instinct for leadership which will purportedly cause them to gravitate to the top in all undertakings in which they participate.

Imagination
Lesson 4 ""Imagination"" discusses stimulating one's mind so that one will conceive new ideas and develop new plans to help in attaining the object of the reader's Definite Chief Aim. This lesson teaches how to ""build new homes out of old stones"", so to speak. It shows how to create new ideas out of old, well known concepts and how to put old ideas to new uses. This one lesson alone is reportedly the equivalent of a very practical course in salesmanship.

Action
Lesson 5 ""Action"" shows how actions powered with clear purpose and strong leadership yields desired results.

Enthusiasm
Lesson 6 ""Enthusiasm"" allows readers to ""saturate"" all with whom they come in contact with interest in the reader and their ideas. Enthusiasm is the foundation of a Pleasing Personality, and it is important in order to influence others to co-operate.

Self-Control
Lesson 7 ""Self-Control"" is the ""balance wheel"" with which people control their enthusiasm and direct it where they wish it to carry them. This lesson provides practical insights to help readers take control of their lives.

Habit of Performing More Service than Paid For
Lesson 8 
""The Habit Of rendering More Service than Paid For"" is one of the most important lessons of the Law of Success course. The lesson teaches how to take advantage of the Law of Increasing Returns, which will eventually ensure a return in money far out of proportion to the service one renders. It advances the notion that no one may become a real leader in any walk of life without practicing the habit of doing more work and better work than that for which they are paid.

Attractive personality
Lesson 9 ""Attractive Personality"" is the ""fulcrum"" on which it is suggested that readers place the ""crow-bar"" of their efforts, and when so placed, with intelligence, it will enable them to remove mountains of obstacles. This lesson claims to have made scores of Master Salesmen. It teaches how to transform one's personality so that one may adapt oneself to any environment -- or to any other personality -- in such a manner that the reader may easily dominate a situation.

Accurate thought
Lesson 10 ""Accurate Thought"" is described as one of the important foundation stones of all enduring success. This lesson teaches how to separate ""facts"" from mere ""information,"" and also teaches how to organize known facts into two classes: the ""important"" and the ""unimportant."" It teaches how to determine what is an ""important"" fact, and how to build definite working plans in the pursuit of any calling out of facts. It illustrates how the eyes of an accurate thinker see only facts and not delusions of prejudice, hate, or envy. It explains how accurate thought depends on deductive reasoning and creative thought.

Concentration
Lesson 11 ""Concentration"" teaches how to focus attention upon one subject at a time until it is mastered and its knowledge has been put into operation. The lesson gives techniques on how to ensure one's focus remains on one's goals until they are completed.

Tolerance
Lesson 12 ""Tolerance"" teaches how to avoid the disastrous effects of racial and religious prejudices which mean defeat for millions of people who permit themselves to become entangled in foolish argument over these subjects, thereby poisoning their own minds and closing the door to reason and investigation. This lesson is the twin sister of the one on Accurate Thought, for the reason that no one may become an Accurate Thinker without practicing tolerance. Intolerance closes the book of knowledge and writes on the cover, ""Finished, I have learned it all!"" Intolerance makes enemies of those who should be friends. It destroys opportunity and fills the mind with doubt, mistrust and prejudice.

Failure
Lesson 13 ""Failure"" teaches how to make stepping stones out of all of past and future mistakes and failures. It teaches the difference between ""failures"" and ""temporary defeat."" It teaches how to profit by failures and from the failures of other people.

Cooperation
Lesson 14 ""Cooperation"" teaches the value of team-work in all one does. This lesson teaches readers how to apply the law of the ""Master Mind"" described in the Introduction and in Lesson 2 of the course. This lesson shows how to co-ordinate one's own efforts with those of others in such a manner that friction, jealousy, strife, envy, and cupidity will be eliminated. Readers learn how to make use of all that other people have learned about the work in which they are engaged.

Habit of saving
Lesson 15 The ""habit of saving"" is an important law of success. Savings are created when you spend less than you earn. Napoleon believed that saving is only a matter of habit. Habit builds the walls of limitation.

The Golden Rule
Lesson 16 The Golden Rule teaches how to make use of the great universal law of human conduct in such a manner that achieves harmonious co-operation from any individual or group of individuals. Lack of understanding of the law upon which the Golden Rule philosophy is reportedly based is one of the major causes of failure of millions of people who remain in misery, poverty, and want all their lives.",Red Book Of : The Law Of Success,Napoleon Hill, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789380078311,1st Edition,224,India,English

Humans evolved language as a powerful tool and have been using it effectively for long. Body language is a big part of animal communication and humans have it too. They reveal through many gestures, postures and action thoughts that are not revealed in speech.
Body Language: How To Read Others’ Thoughts By Their Gestures shows how these can be noted and interpreted to get a true picture of the other person’s attitudes and intentions. Words can hide as much as they reveal. People have learned to control speech and writing to manipulate the other person’s response.
However, body language is more natural and subconscious. People may not even be aware that they are giving off signs that reveal their true thoughts. Learning to notice these is the key to being a good communicator.
Written by the author after several years of research, the book provides a lot of insights into the subtle signals that the body gives off while talking. He explains how legs might reveal what a person actually wants to do, how handshakes can be used to assert power and control, how a smile can create a good impression.
He also explains the common gestures of liars and the common gestures that each sex uses during courtship. Interestingly, he also discusses the difference gestures used by people in different age groups in the same situation. He says that gestures and postures get more subtle as the person grows older and learns to control their body language.
Body Language: How To Read Others’ Thoughts By Their Gestures also shows how to use body signals and cues to communicate more effectively, how to control them to manipulate other people.

The Work of a Lifetime
Andrew Carnegie, the founder of a steel corporation that later helped form U.S. Steel and a great philanthropist, charged the young Napoleon Hill with what was to be his life's work: the assembling and analyzing of the qualities that had allowed the great figures of the early United States to achieve their lasting success. Armed only with introductions from Carnegie and a fierce determination, Hill set out to interview more than five hundred of these titans and distill their philosophies into a logical framework. 
From men such as Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Woodrow Wilson, and later Franklin Roosevelt, Hill gained invaluable insights. He also learned about the limitations each faced: He found Ford personally insufferable; he encountered and understood Edison's struggles with near deafness; and though he worked hard for FDR during the Great Depression to combat the national malaise, he disagreed strongly with many of the President's programs. Hill believed they placed too little emphasis on individual effort and lured Americans into relying on others, instead of on themselves. But by observing, working, and talking with these people, Hill learned priceless lessons that were much greater than the sum of his subjects' accomplishments. 
Though Hill had already published a number of books which revealed his findings in broad detail and enjoyed commercial success, his crowning achievement was the publication of the all-time best-selling business inspirational book Think and Grow Rich in 1937. 
This clear, concise elucidation of the way to success was an immediate sensation. It lays out the techniques of personal achievement in everyday language, full of examples and exhortations. More than fifty years later, supported by the work of the Napoleon Hill Foundation, Napoleon Hill's masterwork still finds thousands of new admirers every year, people whose lives are infinitely changed for the better. 
Hill continued to refine his philosophy, sharpening his focus as his wisdom grew and as he met even more people whose lives had been built on the ideas he had outlined. The major outlet for his new knowledge was a veritable whirl-wind of speeches, lectures, and articles he prepared over the next thirty years. He spent his life spreading the gospel of success as directly and as personally as he could. 
Unfortunately so much of the additional intelligence that Napoleon Hill developed was not published in book form. While he persisted in speaking all through his vigorous retirement, the hundreds of thousands of people who discovered. Think and Group Rich after Hill's death in 1970 have not had the advantage of his guidance on the many more practical points he pursued after the book was written.
With this in mind, the trustees of the Napoleon Hill Foundation directed that the key elements of Hill's later inspiration be set forth in this book.",13 Keys To Success 13 Steps To Personal Achievement,Napoleon Hill, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789382677246,"1st Edition,2008",192,India,English

The book does well to highlight the humane and compassionate nature of Lincoln, explaining the way he brought forth the Emancipation Proclamation, which laid the foundation for the Thirteenth Amendment, ultimately abolishing slavery. The role Lincoln played in saving the Union, and the reasons for a number of his actions until his untimely and catastrophic assassination are provided in diligent detail.

The step-by-step scientific approach to attracting financial and spiritual wealth

• This is the 100-year-old book that inspired Rhonda Byrne's bestselling The Secret

• Explains the precise series of practical steps that, if followed, guarantee prosperity

• Reveals the secrets that underlie today’s success and prosperity movements

In his bestselling book, Wallace D. Wattles explains that “universal mind” underlies and permeates all creation. Through the process of visualization we can engage the law of attraction--impressing our thoughts upon “formless substance” and bringing the desired object or circumstances into material form. The author emphasizes the critical importance of attitude: only by aligning ourselves with the positive forces of natural law can we gain unlimited access to the creative mind and its abundant rewards.

The Science of Getting Rich holds the secret to how economic and emotional security can be achieved in a practical, imaginative, and noncompetitive way, while maintaining a loving and harmonious relationship with all of life. By living in accordance with the positive principles outlined in this book, we can find our rightful place in the cosmic scheme and create for ourselves an environment in which to grow in wealth, wisdom, and happiness.


“There is a science of getting rich. It is an exact science, like algebra or arithmetic. There are certain laws which govern the process of acquiring riches. Once a person learns and obeys these laws, he will get rich with mathematical certainty.”

Darwin opens by saying that while on board the HMS Beagle as a naturalist in South America he made observations about the animals and the land which formed the foundation for what would become his theory of natural selection. He hopes this theory, which he will develop in this book sheds light on “the mystery of mysteries”, the origin of species.

Darwin tells how, when he returned home in 1837, he thought that he may have something worth investigating so he spends the next years accumulating and reflecting on information. In 1844 he writes a sketch of the conclusions that his research is pointing towards but he holds off expanding his ideas, instead researching further, for another 15 years.

He calls his work an abstract for a larger book which will take many more years to complete. He notes that he felt compelled to publish his work now after reading the manuscript of Alfred Russel Wallace, who had arrived at similar conclusions as Darwin and was about to publish his findings. As an abstract he notes that it may be incomplete, imperfect and at times lacking references, but that any questions which arise will be answered when he publishes his findings in full.

Darwin acknowledges that other naturalists have observed the relations between similar species but have attributed the cause of these changes exclusively to external conditions such as climate and food. He sees these causes as insufficient to account for the great variation in nature. In order to research what other forces could be at work he will look first at his research with domesticated plants and animals even though this was not a common practice of other naturalists.

The introduction closes with Darwin laying out in the arguments that each of the following chapters will explore in more detail. In particular he explains that traits may pass from one generation to the next, that into each generation more individuals will be born than can possibly survive and the ones that do survive will do so because of slight competitive advantages that they inherit and consequently pass on to their offspring. This natural selection is what, over time, causes some species to evolve, others to diverge and become their own unique species and others to become extinct. This being true, all species are in some manner related to each other and not independently created.

The Prince of Denmark, Hamlet is in Germany in pursuit of education. Suddenly he is called to Denmark to attain the funeral of his father. When he comes home, he is shocked to see his mother Gertrude already to his uncle, Claudius and he himself has declared the king. Claudius has neglected the fact that the rightful heir to the throne is Prince Hamlet. After observing the situation, Hamlet smells a rat and doubts his uncle.
One night, the ghost of his father visits Prince Hamlet and tells him that he was murdered by his uncle Claudius when he was in sleep. He further says that he was poured poison in his ears while in deep sleep. The ghost entrusts Hamlet with a work of revenge the murderer Claudius and leave Gertrude in the hand of Heaven.
Hamlet plans to put on the fake mask of madness in the castle so as to observe the interaction and get to the truth. But he discovers himself in the great confusion and bewilderment. As he is a philosophical Prince, he keeps on thinking and raises the existence of the ghost and its truth. His behavior is changed because of his confusion and becomes moody. He thinks of staging a play putting the same murder scene that the ghost has described to him. He adds the scene of the murder, calling it The Mousetrap, in the middle of the play The Murder of Gonzago. He had expected that if the ghost is right, then it scene would work on the king and he would certainly show some odd behavior. As expected, the king could not breathe and wants the light, so he leaves the room. Now, Hamlet is fully convinced that he is the real killer of his father. He vows to kill him, but the problem with him is that he is too conscious and thinks a lot. His thought and philosophy immobilize him.
His passive and reluctant act of taking revenge takes the lives of six innocent people. When Hamlet and the queen are in the private chamber, Polonius spies on them. Hamlet discovers this fact and stabs him. Hamlet is punished for killing Polonius and he is sent to England. There he is spied by his school friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. When he knows about this, he arranges the hanging of these two friends instead. When Ophelia, whom Hamlet loves, comes to know that Hamlet has killed her father Polonius, she becomes mad and dies singing sad songs. Laertes, her brother comes from France, witnesses the death of his father and sister, gets angry on Hamlet and both fight. Laertes has a poisoned sword with which he cuts Hamlet and Hamlet too gets the same poisoned sword and kills Laertes. Meanwhile, Hamlets gets the message that his mother dies eating the toast form the poisoned bowl that is intended for Hamlet by Claudius. Before Laertes dies, he tells that Claudius is responsible for the death of Queen Gertrude as the poison is kept in the cup by Claudius. In anger, HhhHamlet stabs the poisoned sword and pours the last poisoned drink from the cup on his throat. Hamlet is at the last moment of his life as he is also cut by the poisoned sword. Before e his death, he declares that the throne must be given to the Prince Fortinbras of Norway. At the end of the play, the new appointed king of Denmark orders a royal funeral for the slain Prince Hamlet.",Hamlet,William Shakespeare, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9788190719049,"1st Edition,2012",176,India,English

The tales relate the adventures of several animal friends and neighbours in the English countryside—primarily Mole, Rat, Toad, and Badger. Although the animals converse, philosophize, and behave like humans, each creature also retains its distinctive animal habits. The story begins when Mole decides to go to the riverbank one morning rather than do his spring cleaning. There he comes across his friend Rat, a water rat, and they spend the spring and summer together. One day they visit the irrepressible, generous, and boastful Mr. Toad, owner of Toad Hall, who possesses large amounts of money but not much brain. Toad is given to fads, and Mole and Rat join him in an excursion in his present enthusiasm, a horse-drawn caravan (a cart with beds and cooking equipment), until a speeding automobile frightens the horse and wrecks the caravan. Toad is mesmerized by the car. Mole and Rat later go to the Wild Wood to visit the kindly and responsible Badger, to whom they report that Toad has bought and smashed several automobiles.

The three friends attempt an intervention, to prevent Toad from buying and wrecking more motorcars. Despite their efforts to contain him, Toad escapes, and, when he encounters an unattended car, he steals it. Inevitably, he is caught and sent to prison. However, the jailer’s daughter takes pity on him and helps him escape. After many further adventures, Toad is at last rescued by Rat. He learns that in his absence, Toad Hall has been taken over by weasels and stoats, but Badger knows that Toad Hall has a secret tunnel entrance, and the interlopers are evicted in a climactic battle, followed by a celebratory banquet.

Between Toad’s adventures, the other three main characters experience quieter events, notably in the lyrical chapters “The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,” in which the god Pan appears, unnamed, to help Mole and Rat find Otter’s lost child, and “Wayfarers All,” in which Rat is nearly hypnotized by the tales told by a sea rat.",The Wind In The Willows,Kenneth Grahame, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789381753576,"New Edition,2013",208,India,English

'Think and Grow Rich' Summary of the book
Napoleon Hill, America's most beloved motivational author, devoted 25 years to finding out how the wealthy became that way. After interviewing over 500 of the most affluent men and women of his time, he uncovered the secret to great wealth based on the notion that if we can learn to think like the rich, we can start to behave like them. By understanding and applying the thirteen simple steps that constitute Hill's formula, you can achieve your goals, change your life and join the ranks of the rich and successful. In this updated edition, Dr. Arthur R. Pell provides examples of men and women who, in recent times, exemplify the principles that Hill promulgated. With the success stories of top achievers such as Bill Gates and Steven Spielberg, he proves that Hill's philosophies are as valid today as they were then. If you're looking to become the next Bill Gates, this is the book for you.",Think and Grow Rich (The Secret to Freedom And Success),Napoleon Hill, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789385869761,"1st Edition,2016",224,India,English

Macbeth, Thane of Glamis, receives a prophecy from a trio of witches who predict that he will become Thane of Cawdor and ""king hereafter."" His wife, Lady Macbeth, urges him to seize the opportunity and take the throne. One night, Macbeth murders King Duncan in his sleep and frames the guards for the crime.


Macbeth's best friend, Banquo, was present for the witches' prophecy and realizes that Macbeth is responsible for King Duncan's murder. To protect himself, Macbeth has Banquo killed. Fleance, Banquo's son, escapes and is prophesied to become king.


Duncan's sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, flee Scotland, where they begin plotting against Macbeth. One of their allies, Macduff, poses a serious threat to Macbeth, so the new king has Macduff crowned king. Malcolm and Macduff join forces and prepare for war.


Overcome with remorse over the murder of King Duncan, Lady Macbeth commits suicide. Her death barely affects Macbeth, who has received three new prophecies: to beware Macduff, that ""none of woman born"" shall harm him, and that he won't be defeated until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane Hill. Macbeth nearly assumes that he is invincible.


Macduff's forces camouflage themselves with foliage from Birnam Wood as they march on Dunsinane. Macduff, the product of a gruesome c-section, was not ""of woman born"" and thus has the power to defeat Macbeth, who realizes too late that the witches' prophecies foretold his death and not his success.

The book Acres of Diamonds is one of the most famous books in the world. The author, Russell Conwell, was asked to give a speech to the 10 year reunion of his Civil War troops. He gave this speech as a result. It was then requested over and over again throughout the years.
It is fair to say this speech was given more times than any other speech in the history of the world. Russell Conwell personally gave this speech over 6,000 times, traveling from city to city. With the proceeds of the speech, he would pay for his room, board and train fare, then send the rest back to Temple University. These funds put nearly 2,000 students through college. 
Discover your very own Acres of Diamonds
The book details story after story of people overlooking riches in their own back yard, only to spend their time looking elsewhere. 
You owe it to yourself to read Acres of Diamonds. 
You can download the book for free by signing up for it in the upper left part of this page. 
I've added a workbook filled with questions on how you can discover your own Acres of Diamonds. 

The workbook grew out of helping hundreds of people look for their Acres of Diamonds.
There are a growing number of case studies as well of up to date examples of people finding or missing their own opportunities. 
In having coached hundreds of people over the years I've discovered some interesting things: 
* Most people under value what they know
* Most people think of themselves as ordinary and accept ordinary incomes and outcomes
* Once people are made aware of the value of what they know, they go on to be much more successful
* Once people wake-up to the possibilities of finding opportunities, they start to see them everywhere
It is not about making people greedy, focused on money. The people that talk about money the most are those that don't have it. 
Way too many people are going through life as paupers when they are standing just a few feet away from limitless wealth and success. Turn on the lights, take off the blinders, discover what diamonds look like in the rough. 
If you have to spend a lifetime working, work for higher wages. If you are going to start a business, find one that people are clamoring for. If you are going to strive to be successful, discover the success that is right in front of you.",Acres of Diamonds : The Brilliant Manifesto That Has Inspired Millions,Russell H.

Egeon, a merchant of Syracuse, is condemned to death in Ephesus for violating the ban against travel between the two rival cities. As he is led to his execution, he tells the Ephesian Duke, Solinus, that he has come to Syracuse in search of his wife and one of his twin sons, who were separated from him 25 years ago in a shipwreck. The other twin, who grew up with Egeon, is also traveling the world in search of the missing half of their family. (The twins, we learn, are identical, and each has an identical twin slave named Dromio.) The Duke is so moved by this story that he grants Egeon a day to raise the thousand-mark ransom that would be necessary to save his life.

Meanwhile, unknown to Egeon, his son Antipholus of Syracuse (and Antipholus' slave Dromio) is also visiting Ephesus--where Antipholus' missing twin, known as Antipholus of Ephesus, is a prosperous citizen of the city. Adriana, Antipholus of Ephesus' wife, mistakes Antipholus of Syracuse for her husband and drags him home for dinner, leaving Dromio of Syracuse to stand guard at the door and admit no one. Shortly thereafter, Antipholus of Ephesus (with his slave Dromio of Ephesus) returns home and is refused entry to his own house. Meanwhile, Antipholus of Syracuse has fallen in love with Luciana, Adriana's sister, who is appalled at the behavior of the man she thinks is her brother-in-law.

The confusion increases when a gold chain ordered by the Ephesian Antipholus is given to Antipholus of Syracuse. Antipholus of Ephesus refuses to pay for the chain (unsurprisingly, since he never received it) and is arrested for debt. His wife, seeing his strange behavior, decides he has gone mad and orders him bound and held in a cellar room. Meanwhile, Antipholus of Syracuse and his slave decide to flee the city, which they believe to be enchanted, as soon as possible--only to be menaced by Adriana and the debt officer. They seek refuge in a nearby abbey.

Adriana now begs the Duke to intervene and remove her ""husband"" from the abbey into her custody. Her real husband, meanwhile, has broken loose and now comes to the Duke and levels charges against his wife. The situation is finally resolved by the Abbess, Emilia, who brings out the set of twins and reveals herself to be Egeon's long-lost wife. Antipholus of Ephesus reconciles with Adriana; Egeon is pardoned by the Duke and reunited with his spouse; Antipholus of Syracuse resumes his romantic pursuit of Luciana, and all ends happily with the two Dromios embracing.",The Comedy Of Errors,William Shakespeare, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,978-9380078861,"1st Edition,2008",120,India,English

The first part narrates incidents of Gandhi's childhood, his experiments with eating meat, smoking, drinking, stealing and subsequent atonement. There are two texts that had a lasting influence on Gandhi, both of which he read in childhood. He records the profound impact of the play Harishchandra and says,""I read it with intense interest...It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number."" Another text he mentions reading that deeply affected him was Shravana Pitrabhakti Nataka, a play about Shravana's devotion to his parents. Gandhi got married at the age of 13. In his words, ""It is my painful duty to have to record here my marriage at the age of thirteen...I can see no moral argument in support of such a preposterously early marriage."" Another important event documented in this part is the demise of Gandhi's father Karamchand Gandhi. Gandhi wrote the book to deal with his experiment for truth.

They have mastered the art of dealing with people! 

Let this book show you how to: 

*Achieve your goals
*Handle the human ego
*Become a master conversationalist
*Make others feel good about themselves
*And much more!

Skill with people is the one essential ingredient for success and happiness at home and in business. ""The Art of Dealing With People"" gives you the skills to take your people skills to a level that you never thought possible!

Skill in human relations is similar to skill in any other field, in that success depends on understanding and mastering certain basic general principles. You must not only know what to do, but why you're doing it.

As far as basic principles are concerned, people are all the same. Yet each individual person you meet is different. If you attempted to learn some gimmick to deal successfully with each separate individual you met, you would be face with a hopeless task.

Influencing people is an art, not a gimmick. When you apply gimmicks in a superficial, mechanical manner, you go through the same motions as the person who ""has a way,"" but it doesn't work for you.

The purpose of this book is to give you knowledge based upon an understanding of human nature: why people act the way they do. The methods presented in this book have been tested on thousands of people who have attended my human relations seminars. They are not just my pet ideas of how you should deal with people, but ideas that have stood the test of how you must deal with people. That is, if you want to get along with them and get what you want at the same time.

Yes, we all want success and happiness. And the day is long past, if it ever existed, when you could achieve these goals by forcing people to give you what you want. And begging is no better, for no one has respect for, or any desire to help, the person who constantly kowtows and literally goes around with his hand out, begging other people to like him.

The one successful way to get the things you want from life is to acquire skill in dealing with people. Read on and you will learn how.","Skill with people and the Art of Dealing with people (Achieve your goals,Handle the human ego,Become a master conversationalist)",Les Giblin, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789381753750, ,160,India,English

Born 1706 in Boston, Benjamin Franklin was the 15th of his father's 17 children. He went to school as a child with the intent of becoming a minister, as his father, Josiah, intended. However, that idea was dropped after Franklin showed a keen interest in reading and writing. He was apprenticed to his brother, James at a young age, but after fighting with his brother he quit the job and moved to Philadelphia, where he worked for a man named Samuel Keimer. After befriending some prominent political figures, including the royal Governor, Franklin left for England, where he spent 18 months working for a printer with his friend James Ralph, with whom he later became estranged. Shortly after returning to America in 1726, Franklin formed a debating club called the Junto. Two years later, he took over The Pennsylvania Gazette from Keimer and turned it into a successful publication with tools from London. In 1730, Franklin wed his old sweetheart, Deborah Read, with whom he had two children. The first, William Franklin, was born approximately one year later; he is the man to whom the Autobiography is addressed in Part One.

Throughout the 1730s, Franklin held some minor positions doing printing work for the government. In that time, he began Poor Richard's Almanac and became postmaster of Philadelphia. Towards the end of the decade, he invented the Franklin stove. In the 1740s, Franklin worked on several projects, including the fire brigade, the police force, the University of Pennsylvania, the street sweeping service and some other smaller public works projects. He retired from the printing business in 1748 and began to conduct scientific experiments in lightning. In 1753, he was awarded honorary degrees from Harvard and Yale, and he became Postmaster General of America. The following year, when war broke out between England and France (the French and Indian War Franklin began to draft proposals outlining means by which funds could be raised for colonial defense. He succeeded in many of his proposals, and he personally played a large part in organizing the war effort. The Autobiography, however, breaks off in 1757; it is left unfinished.

The Autobiography itself was written in three different times: 1771 in England, 1783-83 in France, and 1788 in America. If Franklin meant to complete it, he died before he got the chance.",The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,Benjamin Franklin, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789380078540, ,231,India,English

ABOUT THE BOOK
How to Live on 24 Hours a Day, written by Arnold Bennett, is part of a larger work entitled How to Live. In this volume, he offers practical advice on how one might live (as opposed to just existing) within the confines of 24 hours a day.
In the book, Bennett addressed the large and growing number of white-collar workers that had accumulated since the advent of the Industrial Revolution. In his view, these workers put in eight hours a day, 40 hours a week, at jobs they did not enjoy, and at worst hated. They worked to make a living, but their daily existence consisted of waking up, getting ready for work, working as little as possible during the work day, going home, unwinding, going to sleep, and repeating the process the next day. In short, he didn't believe they were really living.
Bennett addressed this problem by urging these “salarymen” to seize their extra time, and make the most of it to improve themselves. Extra time could be found at the beginning of the day, by waking up early, and on the ride to work, on the way home from work, in the evening hours, and especially during the weekends. During this time, he prescribed improvement measures such as reading great literature, taking an interest in the arts, reflecting on life, and learning self-discipline.","How To Live On 24 Hours A Day (The Key To a Fuller,Richer Life)",Arnold Bennett, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789381753101,"1st Edition,2013",112,India,English

“10 Day Of Her Life As Seen By David Colberet” Introduction: 
The short life of an ordinary schoolgirl may seem to be an unlikely subject for a biography. Yet when we read about Anne Frank, we defy what Nazi Germany hoped to achieve. The Holocaust was meant to be nameless-the Nazis tattooed numbers on most of their victims instead. Some of the world's first large. Computers, sold to the Nazis by the American company IBM, literally reduced the victims to old style computer punch cards. So the personal story of every Holocaust victim is an act of defiance simply because it's personal.
It's easy to quote statistics: six million Jews murdered-90 percent of the Jewish population of Poland, Germany, and other European countries. More than three million Poles, Slavs, Communists, Socialists, pacifist Christians, Gypsies (Roma), homo-sexuals, disabled, and people of African descent bring the total murdered to perhaps eleven million…",10 Day Of Her Life As Seen By David Colberet,Anne Frank, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789381753781, ,192,India,English

There were 118 limited edition copies which were given to many of America's most successful individuals, all of whom had contributed to the content of the book. Orne Publishing used one of these original copies to create a reprinted version of The Law of Success in 2010.The Book of 16 lessons that make up the text:
A Definite Purpose
Lesson 1 ""A Definite Purpose"" teaches readers how to save the wasted effort which the majority of people expend in trying to find their life-work. This lesson aims to show how to do away forever with aimlessness, to fix one's heart, and to land upon some definite, well-conceived purpose as a life-work.

Self-Confidence
Lesson 2 ""Self-Confidence"" describes how to master the six basic fears with which every person is cursed: the fear of Poverty, the fear of Ill Health, the fear of Old Age, the fear of Criticism, the fear of Loss of Love of Someone, and the fear of Death. It teaches the difference between egotism and real self-confidence which is based upon definite, usable knowledge.

Initiative and leadership
Lesson 3 ""Initiative and leadership"" shows how to become a leader instead of a follower in one's chosen field of endeavor. It helps develop in readers the instinct for leadership which will purportedly cause them to gravitate to the top in all undertakings in which they participate.

Imagination
Lesson 4 ""Imagination"" discusses stimulating one's mind so that one will conceive new ideas and develop new plans to help in attaining the object of the reader's Definite Chief Aim. This lesson teaches how to ""build new homes out of old stones"", so to speak. It shows how to create new ideas out of old, well known concepts and how to put old ideas to new uses. This one lesson alone is reportedly the equivalent of a very practical course in salesmanship.

Action
Lesson 5 ""Action"" shows how actions powered with clear purpose and strong leadership yields desired results.

Enthusiasm
Lesson 6 ""Enthusiasm"" allows readers to ""saturate"" all with whom they come in contact with interest in the reader and their ideas. Enthusiasm is the foundation of a Pleasing Personality, and it is important in order to influence others to co-operate.

Self-Control
Lesson 7 ""Self-Control"" is the ""balance wheel"" with which people control their enthusiasm and direct it where they wish it to carry them. This lesson provides practical insights to help readers take control of their lives.

Habit of Performing More Service than Paid For
Lesson 8 
""The Habit Of rendering More Service than Paid For"" is one of the most important lessons of the Law of Success course. The lesson teaches how to take advantage of the Law of Increasing Returns, which will eventually ensure a return in money far out of proportion to the service one renders. It advances the notion that no one may become a real leader in any walk of life without practicing the habit of doing more work and better work than that for which they are paid.

Attractive personality
Lesson 9 ""Attractive Personality"" is the ""fulcrum"" on which it is suggested that readers place the ""crow-bar"" of their efforts, and when so placed, with intelligence, it will enable them to remove mountains of obstacles. This lesson claims to have made scores of Master Salesmen. It teaches how to transform one's personality so that one may adapt oneself to any environment -- or to any other personality -- in such a manner that the reader may easily dominate a situation.

Accurate thought
Lesson 10 ""Accurate Thought"" is described as one of the important foundation stones of all enduring success. This lesson teaches how to separate ""facts"" from mere ""information,"" and also teaches how to organize known facts into two classes: the ""important"" and the ""unimportant."" It teaches how to determine what is an ""important"" fact, and how to build definite working plans in the pursuit of any calling out of facts. It illustrates how the eyes of an accurate thinker see only facts and not delusions of prejudice, hate, or envy. It explains how accurate thought depends on deductive reasoning and creative thought.

Concentration
Lesson 11 ""Concentration"" teaches how to focus attention upon one subject at a time until it is mastered and its knowledge has been put into operation. The lesson gives techniques on how to ensure one's focus remains on one's goals until they are completed.

Tolerance
Lesson 12 ""Tolerance"" teaches how to avoid the disastrous effects of racial and religious prejudices which mean defeat for millions of people who permit themselves to become entangled in foolish argument over these subjects, thereby poisoning their own minds and closing the door to reason and investigation. This lesson is the twin sister of the one on Accurate Thought, for the reason that no one may become an Accurate Thinker without practicing tolerance. Intolerance closes the book of knowledge and writes on the cover, ""Finished, I have learned it all!"" Intolerance makes enemies of those who should be friends. It destroys opportunity and fills the mind with doubt, mistrust and prejudice.

Failure
Lesson 13 ""Failure"" teaches how to make stepping stones out of all of past and future mistakes and failures. It teaches the difference between ""failures"" and ""temporary defeat."" It teaches how to profit by failures and from the failures of other people.

Cooperation
Lesson 14 ""Cooperation"" teaches the value of team-work in all one does. This lesson teaches readers how to apply the law of the ""Master Mind"" described in the Introduction and in Lesson 2 of the course. This lesson shows how to co-ordinate one's own efforts with those of others in such a manner that friction, jealousy, strife, envy, and cupidity will be eliminated. Readers learn how to make use of all that other people have learned about the work in which they are engaged.

Habit of saving
Lesson 15 The ""habit of saving"" is an important law of success. Savings are created when you spend less than you earn. Napoleon believed that saving is only a matter of habit. Habit builds the walls of limitation.

The Golden Rule
Lesson 16 The Golden Rule teaches how to make use of the great universal law of human conduct in such a manner that achieves harmonious co-operation from any individual or group of individuals. Lack of understanding of the law upon which the Golden Rule philosophy is reportedly based is one of the major causes of failure of millions of people who remain in misery, poverty, and want all their lives.",Red Book Of : The Law Of Success,Napoleon Hill, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789380078311,1st Edition,224,India,English

Body Language: How To Read Others’ Thoughts By Their Gestures shows how these can be noted and interpreted to get a true picture of the other person’s attitudes and intentions. Words can hide as much as they reveal. People have learned to control speech and writing to manipulate the other person’s response.
However, body language is more natural and subconscious. People may not even be aware that they are giving off signs that reveal their true thoughts. Learning to notice these is the key to being a good communicator.
Written by the author after several years of research, the book provides a lot of insights into the subtle signals that the body gives off while talking. He explains how legs might reveal what a person actually wants to do, how handshakes can be used to assert power and control, how a smile can create a good impression.
He also explains the common gestures of liars and the common gestures that each sex uses during courtship. Interestingly, he also discusses the difference gestures used by people in different age groups in the same situation. He says that gestures and postures get more subtle as the person grows older and learns to control their body language.
Body Language: How To Read Others’ Thoughts By Their Gestures also shows how to use body signals and cues to communicate more effectively, how to control them to manipulate other people. This book is a comprehensive guide on the secret language of the body that mostly speaks the truth even while the mouth is uttering lies.",Body Language,Allan Pease, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789381753408, ,190,India,English

The Work of a Lifetime
Andrew Carnegie, the founder of a steel corporation that later helped form U.S. Steel and a great philanthropist, charged the young Napoleon Hill with what was to be his life's work: the assembling and analyzing of the qualities that had allowed the great figures of the early United States to achieve their lasting success. Armed only with introductions from Carnegie and a fierce determination, Hill set out to interview more than five hundred of these titans and distill their philosophies into a logical framework. 
From men such as Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Woodrow Wilson, and later Franklin Roosevelt, Hill gained invaluable insights. He also learned about the limitations each faced: He found Ford personally insufferable; he encountered and understood Edison's struggles with near deafness; and though he worked hard for FDR during the Great Depression to combat the national malaise, he disagreed strongly with many of the President's programs. Hill believed they placed too little emphasis on individual effort and lured Americans into relying on others, instead of on themselves. But by observing, working, and talking with these people, Hill learned priceless lessons that were much greater than the sum of his subjects' accomplishments. 
Though Hill had already published a number of books which revealed his findings in broad detail and enjoyed commercial success, his crowning achievement was the publication of the all-time best-selling business inspirational book Think and Grow Rich in 1937. 
This clear, concise elucidation of the way to success was an immediate sensation. It lays out the techniques of personal achievement in everyday language, full of examples and exhortations. More than fifty years later, supported by the work of the Napoleon Hill Foundation, Napoleon Hill's masterwork still finds thousands of new admirers every year, people whose lives are infinitely changed for the better. 
Hill continued to refine his philosophy, sharpening his focus as his wisdom grew and as he met even more people whose lives had been built on the ideas he had outlined. The major outlet for his new knowledge was a veritable whirl-wind of speeches, lectures, and articles he prepared over the next thirty years. He spent his life spreading the gospel of success as directly and as personally as he could. 
Unfortunately so much of the additional intelligence that Napoleon Hill developed was not published in book form. While he persisted in speaking all through his vigorous retirement, the hundreds of thousands of people who discovered. Think and Group Rich after Hill's death in 1970 have not had the advantage of his guidance on the many more practical points he pursued after the book was written.
With this in mind, the trustees of the Napoleon Hill Foundation directed that the key elements of Hill's later inspiration be set forth in this book.",13 Keys To Success 13 Steps To Personal Achievement,Napoleon Hill, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789382677246,"1st Edition,2008",192,India,English

An important feature of this book is that it starts well before the Civil War, leading up to it in a precise and lucid manner, which clearly shows all the reasons that actually caused the war in the first place.
The book does well to highlight the humane and compassionate nature of Lincoln, explaining the way he brought forth the Emancipation Proclamation, which laid the foundation for the Thirteenth Amendment, ultimately abolishing slavery. The role Lincoln played in saving the Union, and the reasons for a number of his actions until his untimely and catastrophic assassination are provided in diligent detail.

The step-by-step scientific approach to attracting financial and spiritual wealth

• This is the 100-year-old book that inspired Rhonda Byrne's bestselling The Secret

• Explains the precise series of practical steps that, if followed, guarantee prosperity

• Reveals the secrets that underlie today’s success and prosperity movements

In his bestselling book, Wallace D. Wattles explains that “universal mind” underlies and permeates all creation. Through the process of visualization we can engage the law of attraction--impressing our thoughts upon “formless substance” and bringing the desired object or circumstances into material form. The author emphasizes the critical importance of attitude: only by aligning ourselves with the positive forces of natural law can we gain unlimited access to the creative mind and its abundant rewards.

The Science of Getting Rich holds the secret to how economic and emotional security can be achieved in a practical, imaginative, and noncompetitive way, while maintaining a loving and harmonious relationship with all of life. By living in accordance with the positive principles outlined in this book, we can find our rightful place in the cosmic scheme and create for ourselves an environment in which to grow in wealth, wisdom, and happiness.


“There is a science of getting rich. It is an exact science, like algebra or arithmetic. There are certain laws which govern the process of acquiring riches. Once a person learns and obeys these laws, he will get rich with mathematical certainty.”

Darwin opens by saying that while on board the HMS Beagle as a naturalist in South America he made observations about the animals and the land which formed the foundation for what would become his theory of natural selection. He hopes this theory, which he will develop in this book sheds light on “the mystery of mysteries”, the origin of species.

Darwin tells how, when he returned home in 1837, he thought that he may have something worth investigating so he spends the next years accumulating and reflecting on information. In 1844 he writes a sketch of the conclusions that his research is pointing towards but he holds off expanding his ideas, instead researching further, for another 15 years.

He calls his work an abstract for a larger book which will take many more years to complete. He notes that he felt compelled to publish his work now after reading the manuscript of Alfred Russel Wallace, who had arrived at similar conclusions as Darwin and was about to publish his findings. As an abstract he notes that it may be incomplete, imperfect and at times lacking references, but that any questions which arise will be answered when he publishes his findings in full.

Darwin acknowledges that other naturalists have observed the relations between similar species but have attributed the cause of these changes exclusively to external conditions such as climate and food. He sees these causes as insufficient to account for the great variation in nature. In order to research what other forces could be at work he will look first at his research with domesticated plants and animals even though this was not a common practice of other naturalists.

The introduction closes with Darwin laying out in the arguments that each of the following chapters will explore in more detail. In particular he explains that traits may pass from one generation to the next, that into each generation more individuals will be born than can possibly survive and the ones that do survive will do so because of slight competitive advantages that they inherit and consequently pass on to their offspring. This natural selection is what, over time, causes some species to evolve, others to diverge and become their own unique species and others to become extinct. This being true, all species are in some manner related to each other and not independently created.

The Prince of Denmark, Hamlet is in Germany in pursuit of education. Suddenly he is called to Denmark to attain the funeral of his father. When he comes home, he is shocked to see his mother Gertrude already to his uncle, Claudius and he himself has declared the king. Claudius has neglected the fact that the rightful heir to the throne is Prince Hamlet. After observing the situation, Hamlet smells a rat and doubts his uncle.
One night, the ghost of his father visits Prince Hamlet and tells him that he was murdered by his uncle Claudius when he was in sleep. He further says that he was poured poison in his ears while in deep sleep. The ghost entrusts Hamlet with a work of revenge the murderer Claudius and leave Gertrude in the hand of Heaven.
Hamlet plans to put on the fake mask of madness in the castle so as to observe the interaction and get to the truth. But he discovers himself in the great confusion and bewilderment. As he is a philosophical Prince, he keeps on thinking and raises the existence of the ghost and its truth. His behavior is changed because of his confusion and becomes moody. He thinks of staging a play putting the same murder scene that the ghost has described to him. He adds the scene of the murder, calling it The Mousetrap, in the middle of the play The Murder of Gonzago. He had expected that if the ghost is right, then it scene would work on the king and he would certainly show some odd behavior. As expected, the king could not breathe and wants the light, so he leaves the room. Now, Hamlet is fully convinced that he is the real killer of his father. He vows to kill him, but the problem with him is that he is too conscious and thinks a lot. His thought and philosophy immobilize him.
His passive and reluctant act of taking revenge takes the lives of six innocent people. When Hamlet and the queen are in the private chamber, Polonius spies on them. Hamlet discovers this fact and stabs him. Hamlet is punished for killing Polonius and he is sent to England. There he is spied by his school friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. When he knows about this, he arranges the hanging of these two friends instead. When Ophelia, whom Hamlet loves, comes to know that Hamlet has killed her father Polonius, she becomes mad and dies singing sad songs. Laertes, her brother comes from France, witnesses the death of his father and sister, gets angry on Hamlet and both fight. Laertes has a poisoned sword with which he cuts Hamlet and Hamlet too gets the same poisoned sword and kills Laertes. Meanwhile, Hamlets gets the message that his mother dies eating the toast form the poisoned bowl that is intended for Hamlet by Claudius. Before Laertes dies, he tells that Claudius is responsible for the death of Queen Gertrude as the poison is kept in the cup by Claudius. In anger, HhhHamlet stabs the poisoned sword and pours the last poisoned drink from the cup on his throat. Hamlet is at the last moment of his life as he is also cut by the poisoned sword. Before e his death, he declares that the throne must be given to the Prince Fortinbras of Norway. At the end of the play, the new appointed king of Denmark orders a royal funeral for the slain Prince Hamlet.",Hamlet,William Shakespeare, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9788190719049,"1st Edition,2012",176,India,English

The tales relate the adventures of several animal friends and neighbours in the English countryside—primarily Mole, Rat, Toad, and Badger. Although the animals converse, philosophize, and behave like humans, each creature also retains its distinctive animal habits. The story begins when Mole decides to go to the riverbank one morning rather than do his spring cleaning. There he comes across his friend Rat, a water rat, and they spend the spring and summer together. One day they visit the irrepressible, generous, and boastful Mr. Toad, owner of Toad Hall, who possesses large amounts of money but not much brain. Toad is given to fads, and Mole and Rat join him in an excursion in his present enthusiasm, a horse-drawn caravan (a cart with beds and cooking equipment), until a speeding automobile frightens the horse and wrecks the caravan. Toad is mesmerized by the car. Mole and Rat later go to the Wild Wood to visit the kindly and responsible Badger, to whom they report that Toad has bought and smashed several automobiles.

The three friends attempt an intervention, to prevent Toad from buying and wrecking more motorcars. Despite their efforts to contain him, Toad escapes, and, when he encounters an unattended car, he steals it. Inevitably, he is caught and sent to prison. However, the jailer’s daughter takes pity on him and helps him escape. After many further adventures, Toad is at last rescued by Rat. He learns that in his absence, Toad Hall has been taken over by weasels and stoats, but Badger knows that Toad Hall has a secret tunnel entrance, and the interlopers are evicted in a climactic battle, followed by a celebratory banquet.

Between Toad’s adventures, the other three main characters experience quieter events, notably in the lyrical chapters “The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,” in which the god Pan appears, unnamed, to help Mole and Rat find Otter’s lost child, and “Wayfarers All,” in which Rat is nearly hypnotized by the tales told by a sea rat.",The Wind In The Willows,Kenneth Grahame, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789381753576,"New Edition,2013",208,India,English

'Think and Grow Rich' Summary of the book
Napoleon Hill, America's most beloved motivational author, devoted 25 years to finding out how the wealthy became that way. After interviewing over 500 of the most affluent men and women of his time, he uncovered the secret to great wealth based on the notion that if we can learn to think like the rich, we can start to behave like them. By understanding and applying the thirteen simple steps that constitute Hill's formula, you can achieve your goals, change your life and join the ranks of the rich and successful. In this updated edition, Dr. Arthur R. Pell provides examples of men and women who, in recent times, exemplify the principles that Hill promulgated.

Macbeth, Thane of Glamis, receives a prophecy from a trio of witches who predict that he will become Thane of Cawdor and ""king hereafter."" His wife, Lady Macbeth, urges him to seize the opportunity and take the throne. One night, Macbeth murders King Duncan in his sleep and frames the guards for the crime.


Macbeth's best friend, Banquo, was present for the witches' prophecy and realizes that Macbeth is responsible for King Duncan's murder. To protect himself, Macbeth has Banquo killed. Fleance, Banquo's son, escapes and is prophesied to become king.


Duncan's sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, flee Scotland, where they begin plotting against Macbeth. One of their allies, Macduff, poses a serious threat to Macbeth, so the new king has Macduff crowned king. Malcolm and Macduff join forces and prepare for war.


Overcome with remorse over the murder of King Duncan, Lady Macbeth commits suicide. Her death barely affects Macbeth, who has received three new prophecies: to beware Macduff, that ""none of woman born"" shall harm him, and that he won't be defeated until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane Hill. Macbeth nearly assumes that he is invincible.


Macduff's forces camouflage themselves with foliage from Birnam Wood as they march on Dunsinane. Macduff, the product of a gruesome c-section, was not ""of woman born"" and thus has the power to defeat Macbeth, who realizes too late that the witches' prophecies foretold his death and not his success.

The book Acres of Diamonds is one of the most famous books in the world. The author, Russell Conwell, was asked to give a speech to the 10 year reunion of his Civil War troops. He gave this speech as a result. It was then requested over and over again throughout the years.
It is fair to say this speech was given more times than any other speech in the history of the world. Russell Conwell personally gave this speech over 6,000 times, traveling from city to city. With the proceeds of the speech, he would pay for his room, board and train fare, then send the rest back to Temple University. These funds put nearly 2,000 students through college. 
Discover your very own Acres of Diamonds
The book details story after story of people overlooking riches in their own back yard, only to spend their time looking elsewhere. 
You owe it to yourself to read Acres of Diamonds. 
You can download the book for free by signing up for it in the upper left part of this page. 
I've added a workbook filled with questions on how you can discover your own Acres of Diamonds. 

The workbook grew out of helping hundreds of people look for their Acres of Diamonds.
There are a growing number of case studies as well of up to date examples of people finding or missing their own opportunities. 
In having coached hundreds of people over the years I've discovered some interesting things: 
* Most people under value what they know
* Most people think of themselves as ordinary and accept ordinary incomes and outcomes
* Once people are made aware of the value of what they know, they go on to be much more successful
* Once people wake-up to the possibilities of finding opportunities, they start to see them everywhere
It is not about making people greedy, focused on money. The people that talk about money the most are those that don't have it. 
Way too many people are going through life as paupers when they are standing just a few feet away from limitless wealth and success. Turn on the lights, take off the blinders, discover what diamonds look like in the rough. 
If you have to spend a lifetime working, work for higher wages. If you are going to start a business, find one that people are clamoring for. If you are going to strive to be successful, discover the success that is right in front of you.",Acres of Diamonds : The Brilliant Manifesto That Has Inspired Millions,Russell H.

Egeon, a merchant of Syracuse, is condemned to death in Ephesus for violating the ban against travel between the two rival cities. As he is led to his execution, he tells the Ephesian Duke, Solinus, that he has come to Syracuse in search of his wife and one of his twin sons, who were separated from him 25 years ago in a shipwreck. The other twin, who grew up with Egeon, is also traveling the world in search of the missing half of their family. (The twins, we learn, are identical, and each has an identical twin slave named Dromio.) The Duke is so moved by this story that he grants Egeon a day to raise the thousand-mark ransom that would be necessary to save his life.

Meanwhile, unknown to Egeon, his son Antipholus of Syracuse (and Antipholus' slave Dromio) is also visiting Ephesus--where Antipholus' missing twin, known as Antipholus of Ephesus, is a prosperous citizen of the city. Adriana, Antipholus of Ephesus' wife, mistakes Antipholus of Syracuse for her husband and drags him home for dinner, leaving Dromio of Syracuse to stand guard at the door and admit no one. Shortly thereafter, Antipholus of Ephesus (with his slave Dromio of Ephesus) returns home and is refused entry to his own house. Meanwhile, Antipholus of Syracuse has fallen in love with Luciana, Adriana's sister, who is appalled at the behavior of the man she thinks is her brother-in-law.

The confusion increases when a gold chain ordered by the Ephesian Antipholus is given to Antipholus of Syracuse. Antipholus of Ephesus refuses to pay for the chain (unsurprisingly, since he never received it) and is arrested for debt. His wife, seeing his strange behavior, decides he has gone mad and orders him bound and held in a cellar room. Meanwhile, Antipholus of Syracuse and his slave decide to flee the city, which they believe to be enchanted, as soon as possible--only to be menaced by Adriana and the debt officer. They seek refuge in a nearby abbey.

Adriana now begs the Duke to intervene and remove her ""husband"" from the abbey into her custody. Her real husband, meanwhile, has broken loose and now comes to the Duke and levels charges against his wife. The situation is finally resolved by the Abbess, Emilia, who brings out the set of twins and reveals herself to be Egeon's long-lost wife. Antipholus of Ephesus reconciles with Adriana; Egeon is pardoned by the Duke and reunited with his spouse; Antipholus of Syracuse resumes his romantic pursuit of Luciana, and all ends happily with the two Dromios embracing.",The Comedy Of Errors,William Shakespeare, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,978-9380078861,"1st Edition,2008",120,India,English

The first part narrates incidents of Gandhi's childhood, his experiments with eating meat, smoking, drinking, stealing and subsequent atonement. There are two texts that had a lasting influence on Gandhi, both of which he read in childhood. He records the profound impact of the play Harishchandra and says,""I read it with intense interest...It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number."" Another text he mentions reading that deeply affected him was Shravana Pitrabhakti Nataka, a play about Shravana's devotion to his parents. Gandhi got married at the age of 13. In his words, ""It is my painful duty to have to record here my marriage at the age of thirteen...I can see no moral argument in support of such a preposterously early marriage."" Another important event documented in this part is the demise of Gandhi's father Karamchand Gandhi. Gandhi wrote the book to deal with his experiment for truth.

They have mastered the art of dealing with people! 

Let this book show you how to: 

*Achieve your goals
*Handle the human ego
*Become a master conversationalist
*Make others feel good about themselves
*And much more!

Skill with people is the one essential ingredient for success and happiness at home and in business. ""The Art of Dealing With People"" gives you the skills to take your people skills to a level that you never thought possible!

Skill in human relations is similar to skill in any other field, in that success depends on understanding and mastering certain basic general principles. You must not only know what to do, but why you're doing it.

As far as basic principles are concerned, people are all the same. Yet each individual person you meet is different. If you attempted to learn some gimmick to deal successfully with each separate individual you met, you would be face with a hopeless task.

Influencing people is an art, not a gimmick. When you apply gimmicks in a superficial, mechanical manner, you go through the same motions as the person who ""has a way,"" but it doesn't work for you.

The purpose of this book is to give you knowledge based upon an understanding of human nature: why people act the way they do. The methods presented in this book have been tested on thousands of people who have attended my human relations seminars. They are not just my pet ideas of how you should deal with people, but ideas that have stood the test of how you must deal with people. That is, if you want to get along with them and get what you want at the same time.

Yes, we all want success and happiness. And the day is long past, if it ever existed, when you could achieve these goals by forcing people to give you what you want. And begging is no better, for no one has respect for, or any desire to help, the person who constantly kowtows and literally goes around with his hand out, begging other people to like him.

The one successful way to get the things you want from life is to acquire skill in dealing with people. Read on and you will learn how.","Skill with people and the Art of Dealing with people (Achieve your goals,Handle the human ego,Become a master conversationalist)",Les Giblin, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789381753750, ,160,India,English

Born 1706 in Boston, Benjamin Franklin was the 15th of his father's 17 children. He went to school as a child with the intent of becoming a minister, as his father, Josiah, intended. However, that idea was dropped after Franklin showed a keen interest in reading and writing. He was apprenticed to his brother, James at a young age, but after fighting with his brother he quit the job and moved to Philadelphia, where he worked for a man named Samuel Keimer. After befriending some prominent political figures, including the royal Governor, Franklin left for England, where he spent 18 months working for a printer with his friend James Ralph, with whom he later became estranged. Shortly after returning to America in 1726, Franklin formed a debating club called the Junto. Two years later, he took over The Pennsylvania Gazette from Keimer and turned it into a successful publication with tools from London. In 1730, Franklin wed his old sweetheart, Deborah Read, with whom he had two children. The first, William Franklin, was born approximately one year later; he is the man to whom the Autobiography is addressed in Part One.

Throughout the 1730s, Franklin held some minor positions doing printing work for the government. In that time, he began Poor Richard's Almanac and became postmaster of Philadelphia. Towards the end of the decade, he invented the Franklin stove. In the 1740s, Franklin worked on several projects, including the fire brigade, the police force, the University of Pennsylvania, the street sweeping service and some other smaller public works projects. He retired from the printing business in 1748 and began to conduct scientific experiments in lightning. In 1753, he was awarded honorary degrees from Harvard and Yale, and he became Postmaster General of America. The following year, when war broke out between England and France (the French and Indian War Franklin began to draft proposals outlining means by which funds could be raised for colonial defense. He succeeded in many of his proposals, and he personally played a large part in organizing the war effort. The Autobiography, however, breaks off in 1757; it is left unfinished.

The Autobiography itself was written in three different times: 1771 in England, 1783-83 in France, and 1788 in America. If Franklin meant to complete it, he died before he got the chance.",The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,Benjamin Franklin, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789380078540, ,231,India,English

ABOUT THE BOOK
How to Live on 24 Hours a Day, written by Arnold Bennett, is part of a larger work entitled How to Live. In this volume, he offers practical advice on how one might live (as opposed to just existing) within the confines of 24 hours a day.
In the book, Bennett addressed the large and growing number of white-collar workers that had accumulated since the advent of the Industrial Revolution. In his view, these workers put in eight hours a day, 40 hours a week, at jobs they did not enjoy, and at worst hated. They worked to make a living, but their daily existence consisted of waking up, getting ready for work, working as little as possible during the work day, going home, unwinding, going to sleep, and repeating the process the next day. In short, he didn't believe they were really living.
Bennett addressed this problem by urging these “salarymen” to seize their extra time, and make the most of it to improve themselves. Extra time could be found at the beginning of the day, by waking up early, and on the ride to work, on the way home from work, in the evening hours, and especially during the weekends. During this time, he prescribed improvement measures such as reading great literature, taking an interest in the arts, reflecting on life, and learning self-discipline.","How To Live On 24 Hours A Day (The Key To a Fuller,Richer Life)",Arnold Bennett, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789381753101,"1st Edition,2013",112,India,English

“10 Day Of Her Life As Seen By David Colberet” Introduction: 
The short life of an ordinary schoolgirl may seem to be an unlikely subject for a biography. Yet when we read about Anne Frank, we defy what Nazi Germany hoped to achieve. The Holocaust was meant to be nameless-the Nazis tattooed numbers on most of their victims instead. Some of the world's first large. Computers, sold to the Nazis by the American company IBM, literally reduced the victims to old style computer punch cards. So the personal story of every Holocaust victim is an act of defiance simply because it's personal.
It's easy to quote statistics: six million Jews murdered-90 percent of the Jewish population of Poland, Germany, and other European countries. More than three million Poles, Slavs, Communists, Socialists, pacifist Christians, Gypsies (Roma), homo-sexuals, disabled, and people of African descent bring the total murdered to perhaps eleven million…",10 Day Of Her Life As Seen By David Colberet,Anne Frank, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789381753781, ,192,India,English

There were 118 limited edition copies which were given to many of America's most successful individuals, all of whom had contributed to the content of the book. Orne Publishing used one of these original copies to create a reprinted version of The Law of Success in 2010.The Book of 16 lessons that make up the text:
A Definite Purpose
Lesson 1 ""A Definite Purpose"" teaches readers how to save the wasted effort which the majority of people expend in trying to find their life-work. This lesson aims to show how to do away forever with aimlessness, to fix one's heart, and to land upon some definite, well-conceived purpose as a life-work.

Self-Confidence
Lesson 2 ""Self-Confidence"" describes how to master the six basic fears with which every person is cursed: the fear of Poverty, the fear of Ill Health, the fear of Old Age, the fear of Criticism, the fear of Loss of Love of Someone, and the fear of Death. It teaches the difference between egotism and real self-confidence which is based upon definite, usable knowledge.

Initiative and leadership
Lesson 3 ""Initiative and leadership"" shows how to become a leader instead of a follower in one's chosen field of endeavor. It helps develop in readers the instinct for leadership which will purportedly cause them to gravitate to the top in all undertakings in which they participate.

Imagination
Lesson 4 ""Imagination"" discusses stimulating one's mind so that one will conceive new ideas and develop new plans to help in attaining the object of the reader's Definite Chief Aim. This lesson teaches how to ""build new homes out of old stones"", so to speak. It shows how to create new ideas out of old, well known concepts and how to put old ideas to new uses. This one lesson alone is reportedly the equivalent of a very practical course in salesmanship.

Action
Lesson 5 ""Action"" shows how actions powered with clear purpose and strong leadership yields desired results.

Enthusiasm
Lesson 6 ""Enthusiasm"" allows readers to ""saturate"" all with whom they come in contact with interest in the reader and their ideas. Enthusiasm is the foundation of a Pleasing Personality, and it is important in order to influence others to co-operate.

Self-Control
Lesson 7 ""Self-Control"" is the ""balance wheel"" with which people control their enthusiasm and direct it where they wish it to carry them. This lesson provides practical insights to help readers take control of their lives.

Habit of Performing More Service than Paid For
Lesson 8 
""The Habit Of rendering More Service than Paid For"" is one of the most important lessons of the Law of Success course. The lesson teaches how to take advantage of the Law of Increasing Returns, which will eventually ensure a return in money far out of proportion to the service one renders. It advances the notion that no one may become a real leader in any walk of life without practicing the habit of doing more work and better work than that for which they are paid.

Attractive personality
Lesson 9 ""Attractive Personality"" is the ""fulcrum"" on which it is suggested that readers place the ""crow-bar"" of their efforts, and when so placed, with intelligence, it will enable them to remove mountains of obstacles. This lesson claims to have made scores of Master Salesmen. It teaches how to transform one's personality so that one may adapt oneself to any environment -- or to any other personality -- in such a manner that the reader may easily dominate a situation.

Accurate thought
Lesson 10 ""Accurate Thought"" is described as one of the important foundation stones of all enduring success. This lesson teaches how to separate ""facts"" from mere ""information,"" and also teaches how to organize known facts into two classes: the ""important"" and the ""unimportant."" It teaches how to determine what is an ""important"" fact, and how to build definite working plans in the pursuit of any calling out of facts. It illustrates how the eyes of an accurate thinker see only facts and not delusions of prejudice, hate, or envy. It explains how accurate thought depends on deductive reasoning and creative thought.

Concentration
Lesson 11 ""Concentration"" teaches how to focus attention upon one subject at a time until it is mastered and its knowledge has been put into operation. The lesson gives techniques on how to ensure one's focus remains on one's goals until they are completed.

Tolerance
Lesson 12 ""Tolerance"" teaches how to avoid the disastrous effects of racial and religious prejudices which mean defeat for millions of people who permit themselves to become entangled in foolish argument over these subjects, thereby poisoning their own minds and closing the door to reason and investigation. This lesson is the twin sister of the one on Accurate Thought, for the reason that no one may become an Accurate Thinker without practicing tolerance. Intolerance closes the book of knowledge and writes on the cover, ""Finished, I have learned it all!"" Intolerance makes enemies of those who should be friends. It destroys opportunity and fills the mind with doubt, mistrust and prejudice.

Failure
Lesson 13 ""Failure"" teaches how to make stepping stones out of all of past and future mistakes and failures. It teaches the difference between ""failures"" and ""temporary defeat."" It teaches how to profit by failures and from the failures of other people.

Cooperation
Lesson 14 ""Cooperation"" teaches the value of team-work in all one does. This lesson teaches readers how to apply the law of the ""Master Mind"" described in the Introduction and in Lesson 2 of the course. This lesson shows how to co-ordinate one's own efforts with those of others in such a manner that friction, jealousy, strife, envy, and cupidity will be eliminated. Readers learn how to make use of all that other people have learned about the work in which they are engaged.

Habit of saving
Lesson 15 The ""habit of saving"" is an important law of success. Savings are created when you spend less than you earn. Napoleon believed that saving is only a matter of habit. Habit builds the walls of limitation.

The Golden Rule
Lesson 16 The Golden Rule teaches how to make use of the great universal law of human conduct in such a manner that achieves harmonious co-operation from any individual or group of individuals. Lack of understanding of the law upon which the Golden Rule philosophy is reportedly based is one of the major causes of failure of millions of people who remain in misery, poverty, and want all their lives.",Red Book Of : The Law Of Success,Napoleon Hill, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789380078311,1st Edition,224,India,English

Humans evolved language as a powerful tool and have been using it effectively for long. Body language is a big part of animal communication and humans have it too. They reveal through many gestures, postures and action thoughts that are not revealed in speech.
Body Language: How To Read Others’ Thoughts By Their Gestures shows how these can be noted and interpreted to get a true picture of the other person’s attitudes and intentions. Words can hide as much as they reveal. People have learned to control speech and writing to manipulate the other person’s response.
However, body language is more natural and subconscious. People may not even be aware that they are giving off signs that reveal their true thoughts. Learning to notice these is the key to being a good communicator.
Written by the author after several years of research, the book provides a lot of insights into the subtle signals that the body gives off while talking. He explains how legs might reveal what a person actually wants to do, how handshakes can be used to assert power and control, how a smile can create a good impression.
He also explains the common gestures of liars and the common gestures that each sex uses during courtship. Interestingly, he also discusses the difference gestures used by people in different age groups in the same situation. He says that gestures and postures get more subtle as the person grows older and learns to control their body language.
Body Language: How To Read Others’ Thoughts By Their Gestures also shows how to use body signals and cues to communicate more effectively, how to control them to manipulate other people.

The Work of a Lifetime
Andrew Carnegie, the founder of a steel corporation that later helped form U.S. Steel and a great philanthropist, charged the young Napoleon Hill with what was to be his life's work: the assembling and analyzing of the qualities that had allowed the great figures of the early United States to achieve their lasting success. Armed only with introductions from Carnegie and a fierce determination, Hill set out to interview more than five hundred of these titans and distill their philosophies into a logical framework. 
From men such as Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Woodrow Wilson, and later Franklin Roosevelt, Hill gained invaluable insights. He also learned about the limitations each faced: He found Ford personally insufferable; he encountered and understood Edison's struggles with near deafness; and though he worked hard for FDR during the Great Depression to combat the national malaise, he disagreed strongly with many of the President's programs. Hill believed they placed too little emphasis on individual effort and lured Americans into relying on others, instead of on themselves. But by observing, working, and talking with these people, Hill learned priceless lessons that were much greater than the sum of his subjects' accomplishments. 
Though Hill had already published a number of books which revealed his findings in broad detail and enjoyed commercial success, his crowning achievement was the publication of the all-time best-selling business inspirational book Think and Grow Rich in 1937. 
This clear, concise elucidation of the way to success was an immediate sensation. It lays out the techniques of personal achievement in everyday language, full of examples and exhortations. More than fifty years later, supported by the work of the Napoleon Hill Foundation, Napoleon Hill's masterwork still finds thousands of new admirers every year, people whose lives are infinitely changed for the better. 
Hill continued to refine his philosophy, sharpening his focus as his wisdom grew and as he met even more people whose lives had been built on the ideas he had outlined. The major outlet for his new knowledge was a veritable whirl-wind of speeches, lectures, and articles he prepared over the next thirty years. He spent his life spreading the gospel of success as directly and as personally as he could. 
Unfortunately so much of the additional intelligence that Napoleon Hill developed was not published in book form. While he persisted in speaking all through his vigorous retirement, the hundreds of thousands of people who discovered. Think and Group Rich after Hill's death in 1970 have not had the advantage of his guidance on the many more practical points he pursued after the book was written.
With this in mind, the trustees of the Napoleon Hill Foundation directed that the key elements of Hill's later inspiration be set forth in this book.",13 Keys To Success 13 Steps To Personal Achievement,Napoleon Hill, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789382677246,"1st Edition,2008",192,India,English

The step-by-step scientific approach to attracting financial and spiritual wealth

• This is the 100-year-old book that inspired Rhonda Byrne's bestselling The Secret

• Explains the precise series of practical steps that, if followed, guarantee prosperity

• Reveals the secrets that underlie today’s success and prosperity movements

In his bestselling book, Wallace D. Wattles explains that “universal mind” underlies and permeates all creation. Through the process of visualization we can engage the law of attraction--impressing our thoughts upon “formless substance” and bringing the desired object or circumstances into material form. The author emphasizes the critical importance of attitude: only by aligning ourselves with the positive forces of natural law can we gain unlimited access to the creative mind and its abundant rewards.

The Science of Getting Rich holds the secret to how economic and emotional security can be achieved in a practical, imaginative, and noncompetitive way, while maintaining a loving and harmonious relationship with all of life. By living in accordance with the positive principles outlined in this book, we can find our rightful place in the cosmic scheme and create for ourselves an environment in which to grow in wealth, wisdom, and happiness.


“There is a science of getting rich. It is an exact science, like algebra or arithmetic. There are certain laws which govern the process of acquiring riches. Once a person learns and obeys these laws, he will get rich with mathematical certainty.”

Darwin opens by saying that while on board the HMS Beagle as a naturalist in South America he made observations about the animals and the land which formed the foundation for what would become his theory of natural selection. He hopes this theory, which he will develop in this book sheds light on “the mystery of mysteries”, the origin of species.

Darwin tells how, when he returned home in 1837, he thought that he may have something worth investigating so he spends the next years accumulating and reflecting on information. In 1844 he writes a sketch of the conclusions that his research is pointing towards but he holds off expanding his ideas, instead researching further, for another 15 years.

He calls his work an abstract for a larger book which will take many more years to complete. He notes that he felt compelled to publish his work now after reading the manuscript of Alfred Russel Wallace, who had arrived at similar conclusions as Darwin and was about to publish his findings. As an abstract he notes that it may be incomplete, imperfect and at times lacking references, but that any questions which arise will be answered when he publishes his findings in full.

Darwin acknowledges that other naturalists have observed the relations between similar species but have attributed the cause of these changes exclusively to external conditions such as climate and food. He sees these causes as insufficient to account for the great variation in nature. In order to research what other forces could be at work he will look first at his research with domesticated plants and animals even though this was not a common practice of other naturalists.

The introduction closes with Darwin laying out in the arguments that each of the following chapters will explore in more detail. In particular he explains that traits may pass from one generation to the next, that into each generation more individuals will be born than can possibly survive and the ones that do survive will do so because of slight competitive advantages that they inherit and consequently pass on to their offspring. This natural selection is what, over time, causes some species to evolve, others to diverge and become their own unique species and others to become extinct. This being true, all species are in some manner related to each other and not independently created.

The Prince of Denmark, Hamlet is in Germany in pursuit of education. Suddenly he is called to Denmark to attain the funeral of his father. When he comes home, he is shocked to see his mother Gertrude already to his uncle, Claudius and he himself has declared the king. Claudius has neglected the fact that the rightful heir to the throne is Prince Hamlet. After observing the situation, Hamlet smells a rat and doubts his uncle.
One night, the ghost of his father visits Prince Hamlet and tells him that he was murdered by his uncle Claudius when he was in sleep. He further says that he was poured poison in his ears while in deep sleep. The ghost entrusts Hamlet with a work of revenge the murderer Claudius and leave Gertrude in the hand of Heaven.
Hamlet plans to put on the fake mask of madness in the castle so as to observe the interaction and get to the truth. But he discovers himself in the great confusion and bewilderment. As he is a philosophical Prince, he keeps on thinking and raises the existence of the ghost and its truth. His behavior is changed because of his confusion and becomes moody. He thinks of staging a play putting the same murder scene that the ghost has described to him. He adds the scene of the murder, calling it The Mousetrap, in the middle of the play The Murder of Gonzago. He had expected that if the ghost is right, then it scene would work on the king and he would certainly show some odd behavior. As expected, the king could not breathe and wants the light, so he leaves the room. Now, Hamlet is fully convinced that he is the real killer of his father. He vows to kill him, but the problem with him is that he is too conscious and thinks a lot. His thought and philosophy immobilize him.
His passive and reluctant act of taking revenge takes the lives of six innocent people. When Hamlet and the queen are in the private chamber, Polonius spies on them. Hamlet discovers this fact and stabs him. Hamlet is punished for killing Polonius and he is sent to England. There he is spied by his school friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. When he knows about this, he arranges the hanging of these two friends instead. When Ophelia, whom Hamlet loves, comes to know that Hamlet has killed her father Polonius, she becomes mad and dies singing sad songs. Laertes, her brother comes from France, witnesses the death of his father and sister, gets angry on Hamlet and both fight. Laertes has a poisoned sword with which he cuts Hamlet and Hamlet too gets the same poisoned sword and kills Laertes. Meanwhile, Hamlets gets the message that his mother dies eating the toast form the poisoned bowl that is intended for Hamlet by Claudius. Before Laertes dies, he tells that Claudius is responsible for the death of Queen Gertrude as the poison is kept in the cup by Claudius. In anger, HhhHamlet stabs the poisoned sword and pours the last poisoned drink from the cup on his throat. Hamlet is at the last moment of his life as he is also cut by the poisoned sword. Before e his death, he declares that the throne must be given to the Prince Fortinbras of Norway. At the end of the play, the new appointed king of Denmark orders a royal funeral for the slain Prince Hamlet.",Hamlet,William Shakespeare, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9788190719049,"1st Edition,2012",176,India,English

The tales relate the adventures of several animal friends and neighbours in the English countryside—primarily Mole, Rat, Toad, and Badger. Although the animals converse, philosophize, and behave like humans, each creature also retains its distinctive animal habits. The story begins when Mole decides to go to the riverbank one morning rather than do his spring cleaning. There he comes across his friend Rat, a water rat, and they spend the spring and summer together. One day they visit the irrepressible, generous, and boastful Mr. Toad, owner of Toad Hall, who possesses large amounts of money but not much brain. Toad is given to fads, and Mole and Rat join him in an excursion in his present enthusiasm, a horse-drawn caravan (a cart with beds and cooking equipment), until a speeding automobile frightens the horse and wrecks the caravan. Toad is mesmerized by the car. Mole and Rat later go to the Wild Wood to visit the kindly and responsible Badger, to whom they report that Toad has bought and smashed several automobiles.

The three friends attempt an intervention, to prevent Toad from buying and wrecking more motorcars. Despite their efforts to contain him, Toad escapes, and, when he encounters an unattended car, he steals it. Inevitably, he is caught and sent to prison. However, the jailer’s daughter takes pity on him and helps him escape. After many further adventures, Toad is at last rescued by Rat. He learns that in his absence, Toad Hall has been taken over by weasels and stoats, but Badger knows that Toad Hall has a secret tunnel entrance, and the interlopers are evicted in a climactic battle, followed by a celebratory banquet.

Between Toad’s adventures, the other three main characters experience quieter events, notably in the lyrical chapters “The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,” in which the god Pan appears, unnamed, to help Mole and Rat find Otter’s lost child, and “Wayfarers All,” in which Rat is nearly hypnotized by the tales told by a sea rat.",The Wind In The Willows,Kenneth Grahame, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789381753576,"New Edition,2013",208,India,English

Macbeth, Thane of Glamis, receives a prophecy from a trio of witches who predict that he will become Thane of Cawdor and ""king hereafter."" His wife, Lady Macbeth, urges him to seize the opportunity and take the throne. One night, Macbeth murders King Duncan in his sleep and frames the guards for the crime.


Macbeth's best friend, Banquo, was present for the witches' prophecy and realizes that Macbeth is responsible for King Duncan's murder. To protect himself, Macbeth has Banquo killed. Fleance, Banquo's son, escapes and is prophesied to become king.


Duncan's sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, flee Scotland, where they begin plotting against Macbeth. One of their allies, Macduff, poses a serious threat to Macbeth, so the new king has Macduff crowned king. Malcolm and Macduff join forces and prepare for war.


Overcome with remorse over the murder of King Duncan, Lady Macbeth commits suicide. Her death barely affects Macbeth, who has received three new prophecies: to beware Macduff, that ""none of woman born"" shall harm him, and that he won't be defeated until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane Hill. Macbeth nearly assumes that he is invincible.


Macduff's forces camouflage themselves with foliage from Birnam Wood as they march on Dunsinane. Macduff, the product of a gruesome c-section, was not ""of woman born"" and thus has the power to defeat Macbeth, who realizes too late that the witches' prophecies foretold his death and not his success.

The book Acres of Diamonds is one of the most famous books in the world. The author, Russell Conwell, was asked to give a speech to the 10 year reunion of his Civil War troops. He gave this speech as a result. It was then requested over and over again throughout the years.
It is fair to say this speech was given more times than any other speech in the history of the world. Russell Conwell personally gave this speech over 6,000 times, traveling from city to city. With the proceeds of the speech, he would pay for his room, board and train fare, then send the rest back to Temple University. These funds put nearly 2,000 students through college. 
Discover your very own Acres of Diamonds
The book details story after story of people overlooking riches in their own back yard, only to spend their time looking elsewhere. 
You owe it to yourself to read Acres of Diamonds. 
You can download the book for free by signing up for it in the upper left part of this page. 
I've added a workbook filled with questions on how you can discover your own Acres of Diamonds. 

The workbook grew out of helping hundreds of people look for their Acres of Diamonds.
There are a growing number of case studies as well of up to date examples of people finding or missing their own opportunities. 
In having coached hundreds of people over the years I've discovered some interesting things: 
* Most people under value what they know
* Most people think of themselves as ordinary and accept ordinary incomes and outcomes
* Once people are made aware of the value of what they know, they go on to be much more successful
* Once people wake-up to the possibilities of finding opportunities, they start to see them everywhere
It is not about making people greedy, focused on money. The people that talk about money the most are those that don't have it. 
Way too many people are going through life as paupers when they are standing just a few feet away from limitless wealth and success. Turn on the lights, take off the blinders, discover what diamonds look like in the rough. 
If you have to spend a lifetime working, work for higher wages. If you are going to start a business, find one that people are clamoring for. If you are going to strive to be successful, discover the success that is right in front of you.",Acres of Diamonds : The Brilliant Manifesto That Has Inspired Millions,Russell H.

Egeon, a merchant of Syracuse, is condemned to death in Ephesus for violating the ban against travel between the two rival cities. As he is led to his execution, he tells the Ephesian Duke, Solinus, that he has come to Syracuse in search of his wife and one of his twin sons, who were separated from him 25 years ago in a shipwreck. The other twin, who grew up with Egeon, is also traveling the world in search of the missing half of their family. (The twins, we learn, are identical, and each has an identical twin slave named Dromio.) The Duke is so moved by this story that he grants Egeon a day to raise the thousand-mark ransom that would be necessary to save his life.

Meanwhile, unknown to Egeon, his son Antipholus of Syracuse (and Antipholus' slave Dromio) is also visiting Ephesus--where Antipholus' missing twin, known as Antipholus of Ephesus, is a prosperous citizen of the city. Adriana, Antipholus of Ephesus' wife, mistakes Antipholus of Syracuse for her husband and drags him home for dinner, leaving Dromio of Syracuse to stand guard at the door and admit no one. Shortly thereafter, Antipholus of Ephesus (with his slave Dromio of Ephesus) returns home and is refused entry to his own house. Meanwhile, Antipholus of Syracuse has fallen in love with Luciana, Adriana's sister, who is appalled at the behavior of the man she thinks is her brother-in-law.

The confusion increases when a gold chain ordered by the Ephesian Antipholus is given to Antipholus of Syracuse. Antipholus of Ephesus refuses to pay for the chain (unsurprisingly, since he never received it) and is arrested for debt. His wife, seeing his strange behavior, decides he has gone mad and orders him bound and held in a cellar room. Meanwhile, Antipholus of Syracuse and his slave decide to flee the city, which they believe to be enchanted, as soon as possible--only to be menaced by Adriana and the debt officer. They seek refuge in a nearby abbey.

Adriana now begs the Duke to intervene and remove her ""husband"" from the abbey into her custody. Her real husband, meanwhile, has broken loose and now comes to the Duke and levels charges against his wife. The situation is finally resolved by the Abbess, Emilia, who brings out the set of twins and reveals herself to be Egeon's long-lost wife. Antipholus of Ephesus reconciles with Adriana; Egeon is pardoned by the Duke and reunited with his spouse; Antipholus of Syracuse resumes his romantic pursuit of Luciana, and all ends happily with the two Dromios embracing.",The Comedy Of Errors,William Shakespeare, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,978-9380078861,"1st Edition,2008",120,India,English

The first part narrates incidents of Gandhi's childhood, his experiments with eating meat, smoking, drinking, stealing and subsequent atonement. There are two texts that had a lasting influence on Gandhi, both of which he read in childhood. He records the profound impact of the play Harishchandra and says,""I read it with intense interest...It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number."" Another text he mentions reading that deeply affected him was Shravana Pitrabhakti Nataka, a play about Shravana's devotion to his parents. Gandhi got married at the age of 13. In his words, ""It is my painful duty to have to record here my marriage at the age of thirteen...I can see no moral argument in support of such a preposterously early marriage."" Another important event documented in this part is the demise of Gandhi's father Karamchand Gandhi. Gandhi wrote the book to deal with his experiment for truth. His disdain for physical training at school, particularly gymnastics has also been written about in this part.",An Autobiography Mahatma Gandhi : The Story of My Experiments With Truth,Mahatma Gandhi, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9788190690997, ,464,India,English

They have mastered the art of dealing with people! 

Let this book show you how to: 

*Achieve your goals
*Handle the human ego
*Become a master conversationalist
*Make others feel good about themselves
*And much more!

Skill with people is the one essential ingredient for success and happiness at home and in business. ""The Art of Dealing With People"" gives you the skills to take your people skills to a level that you never thought possible!

Skill in human relations is similar to skill in any other field, in that success depends on understanding and mastering certain basic general principles. You must not only know what to do, but why you're doing it.

As far as basic principles are concerned, people are all the same. Yet each individual person you meet is different. If you attempted to learn some gimmick to deal successfully with each separate individual you met, you would be face with a hopeless task.

Influencing people is an art, not a gimmick. When you apply gimmicks in a superficial, mechanical manner, you go through the same motions as the person who ""has a way,"" but it doesn't work for you.

The purpose of this book is to give you knowledge based upon an understanding of human nature: why people act the way they do. The methods presented in this book have been tested on thousands of people who have attended my human relations seminars. They are not just my pet ideas of how you should deal with people, but ideas that have stood the test of how you must deal with people. That is, if you want to get along with them and get what you want at the same time.

Yes, we all want success and happiness. And the day is long past, if it ever existed, when you could achieve these goals by forcing people to give you what you want. And begging is no better, for no one has respect for, or any desire to help, the person who constantly kowtows and literally goes around with his hand out, begging other people to like him.

The one successful way to get the things you want from life is to acquire skill in dealing with people. Read on and you will learn how.","Skill with people and the Art of Dealing with people (Achieve your goals,Handle the human ego,Become a master conversationalist)",Les Giblin, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789381753750, ,160,India,English

Born 1706 in Boston, Benjamin Franklin was the 15th of his father's 17 children. He went to school as a child with the intent of becoming a minister, as his father, Josiah, intended. However, that idea was dropped after Franklin showed a keen interest in reading and writing. He was apprenticed to his brother, James at a young age, but after fighting with his brother he quit the job and moved to Philadelphia, where he worked for a man named Samuel Keimer. After befriending some prominent political figures, including the royal Governor, Franklin left for England, where he spent 18 months working for a printer with his friend James Ralph, with whom he later became estranged. Shortly after returning to America in 1726, Franklin formed a debating club called the Junto. Two years later, he took over The Pennsylvania Gazette from Keimer and turned it into a successful publication with tools from London. In 1730, Franklin wed his old sweetheart, Deborah Read, with whom he had two children. The first, William Franklin, was born approximately one year later; he is the man to whom the Autobiography is addressed in Part One.

Throughout the 1730s, Franklin held some minor positions doing printing work for the government. In that time, he began Poor Richard's Almanac and became postmaster of Philadelphia. Towards the end of the decade, he invented the Franklin stove. In the 1740s, Franklin worked on several projects, including the fire brigade, the police force, the University of Pennsylvania, the street sweeping service and some other smaller public works projects. He retired from the printing business in 1748 and began to conduct scientific experiments in lightning. In 1753, he was awarded honorary degrees from Harvard and Yale, and he became Postmaster General of America. The following year, when war broke out between England and France (the French and Indian War Franklin began to draft proposals outlining means by which funds could be raised for colonial defense. He succeeded in many of his proposals, and he personally played a large part in organizing the war effort. The Autobiography, however, breaks off in 1757; it is left unfinished.

The Autobiography itself was written in three different times: 1771 in England, 1783-83 in France, and 1788 in America. If Franklin meant to complete it, he died before he got the chance.",The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,Benjamin Franklin, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789380078540, ,231,India,English

ABOUT THE BOOK
How to Live on 24 Hours a Day, written by Arnold Bennett, is part of a larger work entitled How to Live. In this volume, he offers practical advice on how one might live (as opposed to just existing) within the confines of 24 hours a day.
In the book, Bennett addressed the large and growing number of white-collar workers that had accumulated since the advent of the Industrial Revolution. In his view, these workers put in eight hours a day, 40 hours a week, at jobs they did not enjoy, and at worst hated. They worked to make a living, but their daily existence consisted of waking up, getting ready for work, working as little as possible during the work day, going home, unwinding, going to sleep, and repeating the process the next day. In short, he didn't believe they were really living.
Bennett addressed this problem by urging these “salarymen” to seize their extra time, and make the most of it to improve themselves. Extra time could be found at the beginning of the day, by waking up early, and on the ride to work, on the way home from work, in the evening hours, and especially during the weekends. During this time, he prescribed improvement measures such as reading great literature, taking an interest in the arts, reflecting on life, and learning self-discipline.","How To Live On 24 Hours A Day (The Key To a Fuller,Richer Life)",Arnold Bennett, , ,Maanu Graphics Publishers,9789381753101,"1st Edition,2013",112,India,English

Great leadership is built on great relationships!

Leadership is a relationship-intensive endeavor. If your people skills aren't strong, neither will be your leadership.

In Relationships 101, Maxwell provides time-tested principles for developing healthy relationships with others—inside and outside of your organization—such as:

The fundamentals common to all good relationships
How to motivate people by knowing five things everyone has in common
How to create a lasting connection with people on your team
Why listening skills can be a leader's best friend
The crucial factor that creates the foundation of all good relationships
The most important relationship for any person's success
Winning in every area of life comes from winning with people.
