Lord of the Flies is a 1954 novel by Nobel-prize winning British author William Golding. Golding was knighted in 1988 and was a fellow in the Royal Society of Literature. In 2008, The Times named him third on their list “The 50 greatest British writers since 1945.”The title of Golding’s young-adult fiction novel is a reference to Beelzebub, a prince of hell.

During a wartime evacuation, an airplane crashes on a remote island. The only survivors are young boys, their ages ranging from middle childhood to preadolescence. Ralph, described as “fair” (7), seems delighted when he realizes there are no adults around, but soon Piggy, a fat, asthmatic boy, convinces him of the need to put things right and act proper. By blowing on a conch they find near the lagoon, Ralph calls the others together and becomes their leader. He makes three rules: to have fun, to survive, and to maintain a fire to signal any passing ships.

Opposing Ralph is Jack Merridew. He accepts Ralph’s leadership at first, but soon a schism opens up between them over leadership. The other boys don’t want to follow rules either: they tend to play instead of work. When Jack’s hunter clique lets the fire go out, the schism grows wider, as Ralph blames Jack for losing their chance at being rescued.

Meanwhile, the smaller children (termed “littluns”) grow afraid. They think a beast lives on the island. Simon, one of Ralph’s friends, says that maybe the beast is them, but Jack says he will kill the beast, manipulating the others into following him.

While the children are asleep, an aerial battle takes place over the island, and a dead pilot parachutes down. In the darkness, two boys tending the fire see something billowing and believe it is the beast. After Ralph, Jack, and Roger see the beast for themselves, Jack calls for the others to make him leader, and, when he receives no support, storms off to the other side of the island. His hunters go with him, and soon most of the others as well. From a bastion of stones they name Castle Rock, Jack and his hunters paint their faces, hunt pigs, and raid Ralph’s fire. They erect a pig’s head on a stick. Seeing it, Simon names it “Lord of the Flies” and believes it talks to him, warning him he is danger, that he was right and the beast is all of them, and that the hunters will kill him. When he rushes down to tell the other boys, who are holding a ceremonial dance, he is beaten to death.

Afterward, Jack decides to steal Piggy’s glasses, not only so he can start fires, but so Ralph can’t. They raid Ralph’s camp and take the glasses. When Ralph, Piggy, Sam, and Eric journey to Castle Rock to take the glasses back, Jack ignores Ralph’s authority. He captures Sam and Eric, then attacks Ralph. Above them, Roger loosens a rock that hits Piggy as it is falls, shattering the conch and killing Piggy.

That night, Ralph steals back to Castle Rock, where Sam and Eric tell him he is to be hunted. The next day, betrayed by Sam and Eric, Ralph flees the hunters, who try to smoke him out with a fire that eventually burns the entire island. Ralph kills or injures several hunters as he flees, and as the fire forces him to the beach and the hunters close in, he looks up to see a naval officer standing on the beach. The officer seems to understand what has happened. With heavily-armed ships standing out at sea, he tells the boys he will take them with him.

Stevens is an English butler who has spent most of his life serving Lord Darlington. Now working for a new employer, the distinguished Mr. Farraday, Stevens receives a letter from a former colleague, the housekeeper Miss Kenton. In the letter, she describes her married life, which Stevens interprets as an unhappy one. To Stevens, the letter arrives with a chance to revisit both a lost relationship and the possibility of re-employment. Mr. Farraday believes Stevens wants to go on a motoring trip and lends him his car for a well-deserved break. Along the ride, Stevens reminisces about his past relationship with Miss Kenton. Along the course of the novel, it becomes apparent that they once had feelings for one another, but they had never admitted this to one another. Can Stevens return to Lord Darlington’s service and find the closure he desperately seeks?

Never Let Me Go tranquilly opens with thirty-one-year-old Kathy H., a “carer” for “donors” who will mysteriously “complete,” that is, die, who is about to become a donor herself. Kathy seizes this moment to relate her apparently idyllic childhood at the boarding school of Hailsham, England. In the polite, reserved tone typical of Ishiguro’s first-person narrators, Kathy tells of her youth and that of her friends, cocky Ruth and misfit Tommy, who interact with a cast of fellow pupils at this apparently everyday upscale British institution. The reader of Never Let Me Go quickly realizes that there is a dark mystery at the root of Kathy’s recollection. Soon, the reader learns that Kathy lives in a dystopian alternate world where clones are raised to be harvested for their organs until they “complete” (die), generally after their fourth “donation.” The casual use of these euphemistic terms for barbarous acts is a strong motif of the novel.

The novel has a particularly haunting quality because Kathy, like all of her peers, quietly accepts the strange life for which they are being groomed. The title refers to Kathy’s favorite song at Hailsham. It is sung by a fictional woman singer, whom Kathy imagines is tightly holding on to her baby—a poignant fantasy, as all clones are infertile.

After graduating from Hailsham, Kathy and some of her peers are moved to the Cottages, where they live somewhat aimless lives. Ruth and Tommy become lovers while Kathy, who also loves Tommy, looks on. Their destiny catches up with them when “donations” of organs begin. Kathy cares for Ruth, a “donor,” who “completes” (dies). With Tommy next in line, he and Kathy realize their love and visit their former teacher, Madame, and Miss Emily, the headmistress of Hailsham. Miss Emily reveals the truth behind the cloning program. She also states that Hailsham was closed in favor of functional breeding centers that openly disregard a clone’s humanity. After Tommy dies, Kathy drives to Norfolk, forlornly gazing at the North Sea with a quiet, sad acceptance of her fate.

The plot may appear too far-fetched to be happening in late 1990’s England, when the novel takes place. However, read as a dystopian extrapolation of a society that grooms some of its members to serve others to their death, the novel’s theme is far less impossible. Kathy and her peers act with a quiet sense of duty. They do so in the same way that butler Stevens served Nazi-sympathizing Lord Darlington in The Remains of the Day or other Ishiguro characters served Japanese militarism. In letting Kathy tell of her dystopian world, Never Let Me Go emerges as a poignant tale of the dangers of acquiescence and the high cost of lives wasted nobly for the wrong cause.

It is 1975, a perfect spring in Istanbul. Kemal, scion of one of the city’s wealthiest families, is about to become engaged to Sibel, daughter of another prominent family, when he encounters Füsun, a beautiful shopgirl and a distant relation. Once the long-lost cousins violate the code of virginity, a rift begins to open between Kemal and the world of the Westernized Istanbul bourgeosie—a world, as he lovingly describes it, with opulent parties and clubs, society gossip, restaurant rituals, picnics, and mansions on the Bosphorus, infused with the melancholy of decay—until finally he breaks off his engagement to Sibel. 

But his resolve comes too late.For eight years Kemal will find excuses to visit another Istanbul, that of the impoverished backstreets where Füsun, her heart now hardened, lives with her parents, and where Kemal discovers the consolations of middle-class life at a dinner table in front of the television. His obsessive love will also take him to the demimonde of Istanbul film circles (where he promises to make Füsun a star), a scene of seedy bars, run-down cheap hotels, and small men with big dreams doomed to bitter failure.In his feckless pursuit, Kemal becomes a compulsive collector of objects that chronicle his lovelorn progress and his afflicted heart’s reactions: anger and impatience, remorse and humiliation, deluded hopes of recovery, and daydreams that transform Istanbul into a cityscape of signs and specters of his beloved, from whom now he can extract only meaningful glances and stolen kisses in cars, movie houses, and shadowy corners of parks. A last change to realize his dream will come to an awful end before Kemal discovers that all he finally can possess, certainly and eternally, is the museum he has created of his collection, this map of a society’s manners and mores, and of one man’s broken heart.

A stirring exploration of the nature of romantic attachment and of the mysterious allure of collecting, The Museum of Innocence also plumbs the depths of an Istanbul half Western and half traditional—its emergent modernity, its vast cultural history.

Merging the life of a writer with the city of his childhood is a truly natural and exciting proposition. This becomes all the more true for an author who has come to symbolize the liberal face of Turkey. Istanbul: Memories And The City by Orhan Pamuk is a shimmering evocation of a city that is both intimate and panoramic. Written with a sense of melancholy, the author describes his life and how the change in the city has affected and shaped the manner in which he perceives the city. A personal memoir, the book also talks about prominent authors and writers who are in some way linked to the city.

Istanbul: Memories And The City is a book that revolves around a serious toddler who lives his life among the complicated lives of his family members. The entire household is ruled by the author’s grandmother, who though old and bedridden, controls the entire family but continuously mourns the fact that her sons are wasting the wealth and fortune of the family. Besides this, the author’s childhood is dominated by his uncle and aunts’ fights, and his parents’ collapsing marriage.

Split between his inner and outer reality, the author creates an alter ego and draws the readers into his dark house crammed with formal yet comfortable furniture, unused pianos, showcases with photographs and jewelry. The unloved and decayed city of Istanbul during the sixties and eighties is aptly described in the book. Applying his prose and skill through the book, the author weaves an intricate story about a city with all its customs and traditions and also provides some self-reflection. All in all, Istanbul: Memories And The City is a stunning novel that begins as the autobiography of the author and eventually becomes the story of an amazing and beautiful city.

About Orhan Pamuk

A Turkish novelist, academician and screenwriter, Orhan Pamuk is also the proud recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, 2006.

A major characteristic that is evident in Pamuk’s entire writing style is a loss of identity and confusion, that is a result of the conflict between the values of the East and West. Often troubling and alarming, the books have complex plots and characters. His works are also based on an admiration for various creative arts like literature and painting.

Other books by the author include The White Castle, My Name is Red, Snow, The Black Book, The Museum of Innocence, and The Silent House.

After graduating from the Institute of Journalism at the University of Istanbul, Pamuk became a full time writer. In March 1982, he married Aylin Türegün and they had a daughter named Rüya in 1991. The couple, however, divorced in 2001. Pamuk is currently in a relationship with Kiran Desai, a prominent author. One of the most prominent storytellers of Turkey, his books have sold more than eleven million copies around the world, and have been translated into almost 60 languages.",Istanbul (Nobel Prize Winner's),Orhan Pamuk, , ,Faber and Feber Limited,9780571330348,6th Edition,360,Abroad,English

Testaments Betrayed is a book rich in ideas about the time in which we live and how we have become who we are, about Western culture in general. It is also a personal essay in which Kundera attacks the shifting moral judgements and persecutions of art and artists.
‘This collection of essays, like its predecessor The Art of the Novel, is a joy to read, and in its wealth of ideas puts many a more sober academic treatise to shame.' Literary Review.
'His masterful, musical evocation of the interior history of the novel form ... In a way, this book is nothing so much as a gauntlet, thrown down by Kundera for both novelists and their readers to pick up - if we dare. And it is also a kind of aerobics class, in which all of us can attempt to work off our flabby hypocrisy, and try to assume some lean integrity ... Kundera's own canon may not exactly match our own, but that is one of the things that makes this book so stimulating ... We can only admire Kundera's breadth of vision and devotion to his art.'

With the same dazzling mix of emotion and idea that characterizes his novels he illuminates the art and artists who remain important to him and whose work helps us better understand the world. An astute and brilliant reader of fiction, Kundera applies these same gifts to the reading of Francis Bacon?s paintings, Leos Jan?cek?s music, the films of Federico Fellini, as well as to the novels of Philip Roth, Dostoyevsky, and Garc?a M?rquez, among others. He also takes up the challenge of restoring to their rightful place the work of major writers like Anatole France and Curzio Malaparte who have fallen into obscurity. Milan Kundera's signature themes of memory and forgetting, the experience of exile, and his spirited championing of modernist art mark these essays. Art, he argues, is what we have to cleave to in the face of evil, against the expression of the darker side of human nature.

Elegant, startlingly original and provocative, Encounter follows Kundera?s essay collections, The Art of the Novel, Testaments Betrayed and The Curtain.",Encounter,Milan Kundera, , ,Faber and Feber Limited,9780571250899,"1st Published,2009",178,Abroad,English

The Casual Vacancy occurs in the Parish Council when the popular Councillor Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly of an aneurism. The small village of Pagford is torn apart by petty jealousies and rivalries, and social and political ambitions.

The main issue driving the election campaign concerns the public housing community, The Fields. The high class citizens of the village want nothing to do with the council estate. They believe the inhabitants of The Fields to be an idle group, who live off the state and pass through addiction centers.

Barry Fairbrother had himself come from The Fields and shared a bond with the people there. He wanted to bring the council estate into the mainstream of the Parish Council and had been working on many programmes to help the people of The Field.

One of his favorite proteges was Krystal Weedon, the daughter of a heroin addict mother. He includes her in a rowing team at the school and tries in other ways to bring her of her tough shell and fit into the larger community. After Barry’s death, the undercurrent in the community rise to the surface. The online parish community becomes a hotbed for rumor and accusations as someone under the name The Ghost of Barry Fairbrother reveals secrets about those who are contesting for the council seat.

As secrets are revealed and hidden passions come to the surface, the contest over The Casual Vacancy peels off the idyllic veneer of the attractive village. The petty warring and factionalism in the village community affects many families and leads to tragedies and some final resolutions.

The village and the story are inhabited by complex characters. There is the doctor Parminder Jawanda, a caring member of the community. Yet, she’s not so understanding towards her underachieving youngest child, Sukhvinder, and drives her unmercifully. There is Fats Wall, the school bully who picks on Sukhvinder and harries her beyond endurance. But he too is troubled, as he was adopted and this fact affects his behavior to a great extent.

The Casual Vacancy is mostly a dark tale, peeling off facades to reveal the ugliness of human nature underneath. It also shows many of the characters redeeming themselves after a tragedy that affects the whole community.

The seven stories are all concerned with love, or rather with the complex erotic games and stratagems employed by women and especially men as they try to come to terms with needs and impulses that can start a terrifying train of events. Sexual attraction is shown as a game that often turns sour, an experience that brings with it painful insights and releases uncertainty, panic, vanity and a constant need for reassurance. Thus a young couple on holiday start a game of pretence that threatens to destroy their relationship, two middle-aged men go in search of girls they don't really want, a young man renews contact with an older woman who feels humiliated by her ageing body, an elderly doctor uses his beautiful wife to increase his attraction and minister to his sexual vanity. In Laughable Loves, Milan Kundera shows himself, once again, as a master of fiction's most graceful illusions and surprises.
