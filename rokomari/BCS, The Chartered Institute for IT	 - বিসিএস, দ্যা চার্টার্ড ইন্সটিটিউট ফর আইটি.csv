In today's technology-driven environment, there is an ever-increasing demand for information delivery on various devices in the office, at home and in public places. A compromise has to be struck between security of information and its availability. This book provides significant first steps along the path of dealing with information assurance in a realistic and comprehensive manner. The second edition has been expanded to include the security of cloud-based resources. The remainder of the contents have been reviewed and reordered to reflect the changes to the BCS Certification in Information Security Management Principles which the book supports. ""The security of personal information has never been of greater concern to the public. The BCS provides valuable leadership in this area and this is a timely contribution to a vital process"" (Richard Thomas, Information Commissioner).",Information Security Management Principles,"David Alexander ,Amanda Finch", , ,"BCS,The Chartered Institute for IT",9781780171753,"2nd Edition,2013",226,India,English
