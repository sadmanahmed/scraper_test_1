Acquiring knowledge of Islam is incumbent upon every Muslim - male and female - in order to fashion their lives according to the dictates of the Qur'an and Sunnah.
Essential Rulings for Every Muslim Woman
There are many books on various aspects of Islam in English but mostly dealing with aspects of general nature.

Women have some specific issues concerning them only. Well-reputed Islamic scholars, both past and present, gave their rulings on those issues in the light of the Qur'an and Sunnah.
This book is a compendium of such rulings in a question and answer form catering to the special needs of the Muslim women. It is a concise and readily accessible reference at the finger prints, and inevitable addenda for the Muslim women's personal library.",Fatawa: Essential Rulings for Every Muslim Woman,Ibn Maqbool Husain, , ,International Islamic Publishing House (IIPH),9789960850795,"3rd Edition,2005",308,Saudi Arabia,English

The statements and actions of our Prophet Muhammad (s) contain much that we need: rules and advice, reminders, examples, warnings and encouragement. The collection of hadiths in Forty Hadiths on Good Moral Values by Yahya Ondigo contains some of the Prophet's statements on positive ethics and attributes that all people-Muslims and non-Muslims-should strive to adopt in the way we deal with others; we need to work to incorporate these morals and principles into our daily habits.



The author has commented on each hadith, presenting the issue in a way designed to help readers implement what they have learned.

Presenting the issue in a way designed to help readers implement what they have learned. He writes:
Demonstrating earnest leniency, tolerance and benevolence is the best way for the beauty of Islam to be seen in our own lives with our non-Muslim family members, neighbours, colleagues, workmates, schoolmates and all our fellow human beings that we interact with.Benevolence in whatever actions we undertake is the best form of da'wah that we can give to another person. This is because our actions speak louder than our words: no matter how much we try to convince people that Muslims are generous, peaceful, tolerant, kind, amicable, charitable, and so on, words alone are not convincing enough. If our moral values and compassion are not reflected in our actions, the words become meaningless.
About the author
Born into a strict Christian household in Kenya, Yahya Ondigo was always a man of faith. When his questions about Christian faith were left inadequately answered, Ondigo's search for the truth led him towards Islam. Since then, he has pursued Islamic Studies, become a caller to Islam, and authored several books on Islamic topics, all under publication with IIPH, including My Journey from Christianity to Islam, Muslim-Christian Interactions, and Forty Hadiths on Poisonous Social Habits, which is the companion piece to this present book.",Forty Hadiths on Good Moral Values: with Short Comentaries,Yahya M A Obdigo, , ,International Islamic Publishing House (IIPH),9786035010641,"1st Edition,2010",336,Saudi Arabia,English

Essential Rulings for Every Muslim Woman
There are many books on various aspects of Islam in English but mostly dealing with aspects of general nature.

Women have some specific issues concerning them only. Well-reputed Islamic scholars, both past and present, gave their rulings on those issues in the light of the Qur'an and Sunnah.
This book is a compendium of such rulings in a question and answer form catering to the special needs of the Muslim women.

The statements and actions of our Prophet Muhammad (s) contain much that we need: rules and advice, reminders, examples, warnings and encouragement. The collection of hadiths in Forty Hadiths on Good Moral Values by Yahya Ondigo contains some of the Prophet's statements on positive ethics and attributes that all people-Muslims and non-Muslims-should strive to adopt in the way we deal with others; we need to work to incorporate these morals and principles into our daily habits.



The author has commented on each hadith, presenting the issue in a way designed to help readers implement what they have learned.

Presenting the issue in a way designed to help readers implement what they have learned. He writes:
Demonstrating earnest leniency, tolerance and benevolence is the best way for the beauty of Islam to be seen in our own lives with our non-Muslim family members, neighbours, colleagues, workmates, schoolmates and all our fellow human beings that we interact with.Benevolence in whatever actions we undertake is the best form of da'wah that we can give to another person. This is because our actions speak louder than our words: no matter how much we try to convince people that Muslims are generous, peaceful, tolerant, kind, amicable, charitable, and so on, words alone are not convincing enough. If our moral values and compassion are not reflected in our actions, the words become meaningless.
About the author
Born into a strict Christian household in Kenya, Yahya Ondigo was always a man of faith. When his questions about Christian faith were left inadequately answered, Ondigo's search for the truth led him towards Islam. Since then, he has pursued Islamic Studies, become a caller to Islam, and authored several books on Islamic topics, all under publication with IIPH, including My Journey from Christianity to Islam, Muslim-Christian Interactions, and Forty Hadiths on Poisonous Social Habits, which is the companion piece to this present book.",Forty Hadiths on Good Moral Values: with Short Comentaries,Yahya M A Obdigo, , ,International Islamic Publishing House (IIPH),9786035010641,"1st Edition,2010",336,Saudi Arabia,English

Acquiring knowledge of Islam is incumbent upon every Muslim - male and female - in order to fashion their lives according to the dictates of the Qur'an and Sunnah.
Essential Rulings for Every Muslim Woman
There are many books on various aspects of Islam in English but mostly dealing with aspects of general nature.

Women have some specific issues concerning them only. Well-reputed Islamic scholars, both past and present, gave their rulings on those issues in the light of the Qur'an and Sunnah.
This book is a compendium of such rulings in a question and answer form catering to the special needs of the Muslim women. It is a concise and readily accessible reference at the finger prints, and inevitable addenda for the Muslim women's personal library.",Fatawa: Essential Rulings for Every Muslim Woman,Ibn Maqbool Husain, , ,International Islamic Publishing House (IIPH),9789960850795,"3rd Edition,2005",308,Saudi Arabia,English

The statements and actions of our Prophet Muhammad (s) contain much that we need: rules and advice, reminders, examples, warnings and encouragement. The collection of hadiths in Forty Hadiths on Good Moral Values by Yahya Ondigo contains some of the Prophet's statements on positive ethics and attributes that all people-Muslims and non-Muslims-should strive to adopt in the way we deal with others; we need to work to incorporate these morals and principles into our daily habits.



The author has commented on each hadith, presenting the issue in a way designed to help readers implement what they have learned.

Presenting the issue in a way designed to help readers implement what they have learned. He writes:
Demonstrating earnest leniency, tolerance and benevolence is the best way for the beauty of Islam to be seen in our own lives with our non-Muslim family members, neighbours, colleagues, workmates, schoolmates and all our fellow human beings that we interact with.Benevolence in whatever actions we undertake is the best form of da'wah that we can give to another person. This is because our actions speak louder than our words: no matter how much we try to convince people that Muslims are generous, peaceful, tolerant, kind, amicable, charitable, and so on, words alone are not convincing enough. If our moral values and compassion are not reflected in our actions, the words become meaningless.
About the author
Born into a strict Christian household in Kenya, Yahya Ondigo was always a man of faith. When his questions about Christian faith were left inadequately answered, Ondigo's search for the truth led him towards Islam. Since then, he has pursued Islamic Studies, become a caller to Islam, and authored several books on Islamic topics, all under publication with IIPH, including My Journey from Christianity to Islam, Muslim-Christian Interactions, and Forty Hadiths on Poisonous Social Habits, which is the companion piece to this present book.",Forty Hadiths on Good Moral Values: with Short Comentaries,Yahya M A Obdigo, , ,International Islamic Publishing House (IIPH),9786035010641,"1st Edition,2010",336,Saudi Arabia,English
