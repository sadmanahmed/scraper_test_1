Akbarnāma, or The History of Akbar, by Abu’l-Fazl (d. 1602), is one of the most important works of Indo-Persian history and a touchstone of prose artistry. Marking a high point in a long, rich tradition of Persian historical writing, it served as a model for historians throughout the Persianate world. The work is at once a biography of the Mughal emperor Akbar (r. 1556–1605) that includes descriptions of his political and martial feats and cultural achievements, and a chronicle of sixteenth-century India. The first volume details the birth of Akbar, his illustrious genealogy, and in particular the lives and exploits of his grandfather, Babur, and his father, Humayun, who laid the foundations of the Mughal Empire. The Persian text, presented in the Naskh script, is based on a careful reassessment of the primary sources.",The Akbar Nama (Volume - 1) ,Abul fazl,H.

Fundamentally an expression of life through the medium of language, literature accordingly needs to be systematically studied. The present book is a treasure in this direction owing to its concise and easily comprehensible elucidation of ways of studying the varied genre of literature—poetry, prose fiction, drama, short story, essay and criticism.
A great contribution of W.H. Hudson—a prominent 19th century literary figure, the present book is planned as a guide and companion to one’s own study. It is self-contained, highly interesting and suggestive in itself. It is hoped that it will prove immensely useful to all those readers for whom literature is primarily a means of enjoyment and a help to life.

About Author:
William Henry Hudson (1841-1922) was a prolific author, naturalist and ornithologist. Generally recognised as a masterly writer on the natural world, his works like Argentine Ornithology, British Birds, Birds in London, Nature in Downland are notable. He earned much fame with his books on the English countryside, including Hampshire Days and Afoot in England, which helped foster the back-to-nature movement of the 1920s and 1930s. Hudson was a versatile author who wrote on a wide variety of subjects. His novel Green Mansions and non-fiction Far Away and Long Ago received great acclaim. Hudson is best remembered for his works—A Shepherd’s Life and Adventures among Birds, published in 1910 and 1913, respectively.",An Introduction to the Study of Literature ,William Henry Hudson, , ,Atlantic Publisher (India),9788171560653,Latest, ,USA,English

Concerted efforts are being made across the world to curb the environmental degradation. The UN Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm in 1972 marked the beginning of the development of international environmental law by “soft law” mechanism. With the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982, the state parties have been made obligatory to protect the marine environment, including all the resources therein.
The present book is a treatise on the legal regime of the marine environment in the Bay of Bengal. It provides a comprehensive description and assessment of the legal regime governing this particular maritime area. It focuses on its protection, preservation and development. It deals with fisheries as well as the protection of the environment against pollution and the discharge of waste from land.
Beginning with the study of fisheries management in the Bay of Bengal, the book includes in its study the major agreements and protocols, international documents on marine environment, seabed mining and its consequences, settlement of environmental disputes, and the present-day socio-economic condition in the Bay of Bengal region. The book also provides a bibliography to enable the readers to pursue their study further. The index that completes the book would prove a useful study-aid to all readers. Since the study is embedded in the global perspective of the protection of the marine environment, it shall be of significant use to all those in coastal and naval services, government executives, planners and policy makers concerned with the protection of the marine environment. For the scholars and teachers of International Law, it is an ideal reference book.",Legal Regime of Marine Environment in the  Bay of  Bengal,M.
