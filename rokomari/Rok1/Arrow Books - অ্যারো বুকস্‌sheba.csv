His daughter, Scout is the narrator of the story and she lives with her widowed father and brother. To Kill A Mockingbird first explores the customs of the South, laying down all the quirks and foibles of the neighbors and people that Scout interacts with through her childhood days.

The story of how her brother Jem injured his arm at the elbow is what starts off Scott’s reminiscing journey. This leads them to point out that it was the Ewells who set off the entire string of events that brought about the unsavory incident. And this is what is at the heart of the novel. The narrative that is so delicately handled by Lee is insightful and intuitive.

Atticus is appointed by the court to defend a black man, Tom Robinson who has been accused of raping a white girl, Mayella. However the town doesn’t need a trial since they are steeped in prejudice against the coloured people and to them, Robinson is guilty of the crime.

However, Atticus defends Tom to the best of his ability that turns the residents of this otherwise sleepy town against him and his family members. For the most part, the townspeople engage in hurling insults at the middle-aged man, which is unacceptable to the sprightly Scout. She along with her brother and their friend, Dill manage to disperse the mob of people but the situation grows worse.

Will Tom Robinson serve time for a crime he did not commit and will Scout lose her love for the South as she had before? A poignantly simple tale of losing innocence and more to the law of society, To Kill a Mockingbird does more than just enlighten people.

Published in 1960, it won the Pulitzer Prize and became an indispensable part of American literature. It is the most widely read book dealing with the theme of race relations and has been adjudged as the “Best Novel of the 20th Century” by the Library Journal.

Set in the 1920s, the novel deals with a group of aimless expatriates in France and Spain. They are members of the cynical and disillusioned post-World War I Lost Generation, many of whom suffer psychological and physical wounds as a result of the war. Two of the novel’s main characters, Lady Brett Ashley and Jake Barnes, typify this generation. Lady Brett drifts through a series of affairs despite her love for Jake; she and Jake are unable to consummate their love, because of a war wound that rendered him impotent. Friendship, stoicism, and natural grace under pressure are offered as the values that matter in an otherwise amoral and often senseless world.

John Grisham's first work of non-fiction, an exploration of small town justice gone terribly awry, is his most extraordinary legal thriller yet. In the major league draft of 1971, the first player chosen from the State of Oklahoma was Ron Williamson. When he signed with the Oakland A's, he said goodbye to his hometown of Ada and left to pursue his dreams of big league glory. Six years later he was back, his dreams broken by a bad arm and bad habits - drinking, drugs and women. He began to show signs of mental illness. Unable to keep a job, he moved in with his mother and slept 20 hours a day on her sofa. In 1982, a 21 year-old cocktail waitress in Ada named Debra Sue Carter was raped and murdered, and for five years the police could not solve the crime. For reasons that were never clear, they suspected Ron Williamson and his friend Dennis Fritz. The two were finally arrested in 1987 and charged with capital murder. With no physical evidence, the prosecution's case was built on junk science and the testimony of jaihouse snitches and convicts. Dennis Fritz was found guilty and given a life sentence. Ron Williamson was sent to Death Row. If you believe that in America you are innocent until proven guilty, this book will shock you. If you believe in the death penalty, this book will disturb you.

It's the day of Don Vito Corelone's daughter's wedding. And like any good mob boss, he's spending his time receiving guests who are requesting favors from him.

Yeah...favors.

Outside, the wedding is in full swing, and we meet a bunch of different characters, including the Don's sons, Michael and Sonny.

Don helps his lounge-singer godson, Johnny Fontane, intimidate a movie producer into giving him a part. How, you ask? Oh, no big deal. Don just has the severed head of the producer's prized racing horse placed in his bed. 

That seems to do the trick.

A gangster named Sollozzo tries to rope Don and his political connections into a dope-dealing scheme with the rival Tattaglia family. But the Don refuses. (Like ya do.) And since we're in a mob movie, this leads to a near-fatal assassination attempt on Don Corleone and the murder of his trusted hit man, Luca Brasi. So Sonny becomes the acting Don, while Michael defends the Godfather from a second assassination attempt. 

It's hard out there for a mob boss, eh?

Next up, Michael murders Sollozzo and a corrupt cop, Captain McCluskey, at an Italian restaurant. Mmmm...spaghetti and blood balls. 

Since he just, you know, murdered two guys in cold blood, Michael flees to Sicily, where he marries a young Sicilian woman named Apollonia. Back in New York, all five of the major mafia families (Corleones included) go to war. But tragedy strikes on both continents: a car bomb intended for Michael ends up killing Apollonia, and Sonny is assassinated at a toll-booth (partly thanks to the conniving, wife-beating Carlo, his sister's husband).

So far so bad.

The Don is forced to sign a truce with the Tattaglias and agree to their drug scheme, while Michael is able to return to America. Don Corleone realizes that another Don, Barzini, was the real mastermind behind the assassination attempts against him.

Nothing like a little Don vs. Don scheming.

With the Don getting too old to handle family business, he slips into an adviser role. Michael becomes the new acting-Don, marries Kay Adams (his old girlfriend from the beginning of the movie), and begins the hard work of reassembling the Corleone family's shattered reputation. He puts pressure on the family's casino associate, Moe Greene, who risks making a deal with Barzini, and he tries to identify the traitor who's attempting to help Barzini.

Wanna guess who it is? Turns out to be Tessio, one of their main partners.  Ouch.

Speaking of ouch...at his sister's child's baptism, Michael becomes the baby's literal godfather. And in one of the most famous cinematic scenes ever, we flash between the baptism (aww!) and a massacre that Michael ordered (...not aww).

Michael's hit-men kill the rival Dons, including Tattaglia and Barzini, Tessio, and Moe Greene. Michael exposes Carlo as a traitor and has him killed, too. It's...brutal.

In the end, Michael denies killing Carlo to a distraught Connie and swears the same to Kay. Kay watches as Michael's capos (under-bosses) assemble in his office, paying their respects to the new Godfather. The door to his office closes, and the movie ends.

The protagonist of this book is a young, naive college student of twenty one years named Anastasia Steele. Anastasia acquiesces to interview a 27 year old business magnate named Christian Grey in lieu of her ill roommate and best friend, Katharine Kavanaugh. What she doesn’t count on, however, is how attracted yet intimidated she is by him. She nervously rushes through the interview and then pushes all thoughts of him to the back of her mind. She was counting on the fact that their paths might never cross again.

Christian Grey, in the meantime, is equally taken in by the innocent Anastasia. A man with a fervent need to be in control, he is constantly battling his inner demons. He visits her at her part-time job and agrees to do a photo shoot to accompany the article Kate was writing on him. At the photoshoot, he asks her out for coffee, and the process of the pair getting acquainted with each other begins. However, Christian does not plan on indulging in a typical relationship. He presents Anastasia with a full non-disclosure statement that she must sign in order to continue seeing him. The contract contains clauses about a purely physical, non-romantic, dominant/submissive relationship. Anastasia, initially taken aback, is intrigued nonetheless and decides to give it a shot.

Fifty Shades Of Grey proceeds with a racy and fast-paced story thereafter, as the couple try to work past their obvious incompatibility. Intended for mature readers, it delves into the carnal practises of bondage and dominance. The novel topped bestseller lists across the globe, and has sold over ninety million copies worldwide. It has also been translated into over fifty two languages, and is being adapted into a film which is scheduled to release in early 2015.

Chapter 1 begins with a narration of Hemingway’s own early experience with bullfighting. He reports that he first went to the bullfights because of the influence of Gertrude Stein. Before going, Hemingway says that he expected to be horrified by the killing of the horses in the ring during the bullfight. He went, however, because it served a goal of his writing. He was trying to learn how to “put down what really happened in action; what the actual things were which produced the emotion you experienced.”

With this goal in mind, Hemingway went to Spain to study the bullfights, but once there he found them to be so complicated and so compelling that he began to study bullfighting for its own sake.

The rest of chapter 1 is an interesting mixture of essay and personal observation. Hemingway deals with the question of the morality of bullfighting by writing on the difference between people who identify psychologically with animals (and thus who think the bullfights are barbaric because bulls and frequently horses are killed) and people who identify with humans (and become upset only when the matador performs poorly or is injured). He deals with the question of the aesthetics of bullfighting by writing about how the enjoyment of the art of bullfighting increases in the same way that a person develops an ear for music or a sensitive palate for wine. The basic thread of the narrative is always bullfighting, but Hemingway cannot keep himself from engaging in asides, telling anecdotes, and making lengthy commentaries on other subjects. In this book on bullfighting, Hemingway is creating a persona that developed over the years into the voice of “Papa” Hemingway. In letters that Hemingway wrote before Death in the Afternoon he often apologizes for the advice that he gives to family and friends, calling himself a Dutch uncle. At the time of the writing of Death in the Afternoon, he begins to stop apologizing. His tone throughout the book is one of a kindly, knowledgeable guide who knows what is best for the reader.",Death in the Afternoon (Nobel Prize Winner's),Ernest Hemingway, , ,Arrow Books,9780099908609,"1st Published,2004",330,Abroad,English

Pope Alexander VI (formerly Rodrigo Borgia) believes God will ultimately forgive his many sins simply because, as pope, he is infallible and divine. The Family focuses on this cunning, ambitious despot and his children—the ruthless Cesare and the beautiful but wicked Lucrezia.

A passionate love story runs through the novel, but it is a sinful one. Lucrezia lost her virginity to her brother Cesare when she was only thirteen, and the two have loved only each other ever since. Alexander marries Lucrezia off three times for political reasons, to Giovanni Sforza (Lord of Pesaro), Alfonso of Aragon (Duke of Bisceglie), and finally Alfonso I d'Este (Duke of Ferrara). She remains submissive to her father, if not to her many husbands and lovers. Her final marriage, to Alfonso d'Este, was a success, though neither partner was faithful: she bore her third husband a number of children and proved to be a respectable and accomplished duchess, effectively rising above her previous reputation and surviving the fall of the Borgias following her father's death.

Pope Alexander aims to unify Italy’s feudal states under papal rule. Cesare, who exchanges his cardinal’s miter for a warrior’s helmet to become commander-in-chief of his father’s armies, carries out conquest after conquest to fulfill Alexander’s grandiose ambitions. As in Puzo’s The Godfather, the lovemaking, the opulent festivities, the sub rosa plotting, and the complex double-dealing are interspersed with outbursts of violence, including one memorable scene in which the reformist priest Girolamo Savonarola is torn apart on the Rack.",The Family (The Last Novel By The Author),Mario Puzo, , ,Arrow Books,9780099533269,"Reissued,2009",418,India,English
