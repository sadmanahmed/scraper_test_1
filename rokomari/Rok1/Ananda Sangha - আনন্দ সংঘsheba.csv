He shows how extraordinarily sophisticated this ancient science is in its careful delineation of twelve basic categories of human nature. Your Sun Sign as A Spiritual Guide, however, goes far beyond merely intellectual discussion. Fresh, humorous, and full of wisdom, it provides a wealth of original insight in a field burdened by the thoughtless repetition of carelessly worked-out theories. The specific lessons of each sun sign are described with clarity and relevance and a particular meditation practice is suggested for each.",Your Sun Sign As A Spiritual Guide,Swami Kriyananda, , ,Ananda Sangha,9788189430603,"1st,2012", ,India,English
