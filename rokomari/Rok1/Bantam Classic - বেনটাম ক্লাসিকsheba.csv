The story is primarily a tragic tale of the struggle for the love of a woman, Nastasya Filippovna, between Myshkin and Rogozhin, a dark and impassioned man that the Prince meets on the train to St. Petersburg. ""The Idiot"" is a classic tale of the conflict between good and evil. On the one hand Prince Myshkin represents Dostoyevksy's attempt to portray a Christ-like ""positively good man"" which is sharply contrasted with not only the dark and roguish character of Rogozhin but also with the nature of Russian upper-class society depicted in the novel.",The Idiot,Fyodor Dostoyevsky, , ,Bantam Classic,0553213520,"Reissue,2005",696,India,English

Emma Woodhouse is a genteel lady in Regency England. She has everything, and lacks little in her life. She prides herself in having introduced her best friend and former governess, Miss Taylor to her future husband, and decides she likes matchmaking. Despite her friend George Knightley’s advice, she goes on with her new interest and tries to set Harriet Smith with Mr. Elton, the local vicar. What Emma soon discovers is that matters of the heart are better left to the heart. She learns that trying to force love might just burn both the people involved and it will definitely singe her if she stands too close. A departure from Jane Austen’s usual financially-distraught heroines, Emma’s tale is more of one woman’s meddling where she is neither wanted nor required.",Emma,Jane Austen, , ,Bantam Classic,9780553212730,"1st Edition,1999",422,India,English
