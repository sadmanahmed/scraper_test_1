Many current soil science textbooks still cater for a traditional student market where students embark on three years study in a narrow discipline. The growth in modular degree schemes has meant that soil science is now often taught as self-standing unit as part of broad based degree program. Students pursuing this type of course are increasingly reluctant to purchase expensive textbooks that are too detailed and often assume a scientific background. For those opting to specialise in soil science there are a variety of good textbooks to choose from. This short informative guide, will be particularly useful for students who do not possess a traditional scientific background, such as those studying geography, environment science, ecology and agriculture.

The focus includes pathogenic mechanisms and processes in infectious diseases; methods of diagnosis; and principles of resistance, prevention, and therapy. 
Veterinary Microbiology, Second Edition is now organized in four sections according to the most appropriate methods of instruction. Section 1 deals with the general characteristics of the host– parasite relationship, laboratory diagnosis of conditions involving an infectious etiology, antimicrobial treatment, and prevention of infectious disease. 

Sections 2 (bacteria and fungi) and 3 (viruses) present the infectious agents that affect the veterinary species. The chapters dealing with the bacterial agents are grouped mainly by morphology, and their gram-staining characteristics. The fungal agents are grouped mainly by morphologic characteristics (yeast, mold). The viruses are grouped along taxonomic grounds. 

Section 4, an enhancement new to this edition, deals with the infectious agents in the context of the host. This section is organized by organ system. Each organ system is discussed first as a microbial habitat, followed by discussion of those infectious agents that mainly affect that particular system. 

In addition to serving as a resource for veterinary students, Veterinary Microbiology, Second Edition also serves as a convenient reference for veterinarians and veterinary scientists whose main line of activity and expertise is outside the areas of microbiology.",Veterinary Microbiology-2nd Ed,Hirsh, , ,Blackwell Pub Professional,9780813803791, ,536,India,English
