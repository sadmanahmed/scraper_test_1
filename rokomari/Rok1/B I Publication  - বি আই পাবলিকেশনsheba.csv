Textbook of Medical Parasitology  ,টি ভি রাজন,"",TK. 530,https://rokomari.com//book/88526/textbook-of-medical-parasitology,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/rokimg_20140910_88526.gif,"The last 3-4 decades have seen a massive revolution in our understanding of basic biological concepts, and the field of parasitology has benefited immensely from this revolution. For instance, we now know these organisms to be perfectly adapted to their own specific ecological niches, and to exhibit behavioral and biochemical adaptations that make them ideally suited for their development and propagation. Four decades ago, we knew little if anything about host immunological defenses against parasitic organisms. Now, studies on the host responses to parasitic infections have played a major role in our understanding of 1-cell dichotomy (Thi vs. Th2), responses to antigenic variation and the intriguing mechanisms used the parasites to fly under the radar screen of the host defense mechanisms.

This textbook of parasitology seeks to integrate some of this new knowledge into the study of medical parasitology, particularly with reference to the Indian subcontinent. It focuses primarily on those parasitic diseases that remain major public health concerns in India.

Key Features*

    A comprehensive, yet easy to understand text, structured to provide information in small well identifiable steps.*
    Parasites and parasitic diseases covered in five sections and 44 chapters.*
    Information grouped under major headings like etiology, historical aspects, epidemiology of disease, parasite biology, clinical aspects of infection, diagnostic procedures, etc.*
    Extensively illustrated. Text supplemented by diagrams, photographs. Several full colour photographs included.*
    An Appendix gives a detailed description of Laboratory Techniques in Parasitology.

This book is an attempt to present the information in a comprehensible manner and highlight the basic concepts in pharmacology as applied to rational therapeutics. The information is presented in 74 Chapters; grouped into 13 Sections, and 3 appendices.

The book is primarily intended for use by undergraduate medical students. However, the book can be equally well used as a basic text by students of pharmacy as well as postgraduate students in pharmacology or medicine.

    In general pharmacology, special attention has been paid to topics such as pharmacovigilance, pharmacogenetics and genomics, principles of clinical trials, novel drug delivery systems, drug economics, etc.
    Drug receptor pharmacology, basic concepts and mechanisms of drug action have been detailed for
    all major drug groups.
    Major emphasis is on clinical application of drugs based on their pharmacological actions. Dosage regimes, as universally accepted, are mentioned. These are based on pharmacokinetic parameters of drugs.
    Information has been presented in a simple language and the text is supplemented by numerous figures and diagrams. Important and interesting information has been presented in box form to focus attention and make it visually appealing. Headings and subheadings are liberally used to allow the readers to perceive the overall structure and connection among different topics in a chapter.
    A special feature of the book is summing up of important information in the form of ""Points to Remember"" at the end of each chapter as a help in quick revision of the subject
