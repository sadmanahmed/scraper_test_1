AG Stock was a visiting professor at Dacca University, East Pakistan in the immediate aftermath of the Partition. As a progressive academic, she recorded the political and intellectual ferment of that time with rare insight and sensitivity. As a literary scholar, she wrote lyrically about its social and natural landscape. Her memoir is a classic portrait, in the era of decolonisation, of a people passionate in the defence of their culture, and of a new nation in vigorous search of its identity.",Memoirs of Dacca University 1947-1951,A.G.

The thought-provoking and engaging debut short story collection from an emergent Bangladeshi voice sees compelling protagonists journey through energetic narratives that are a blend of socio-political satire and fresh humour. Traversing rural and urban Bangladesh and England, the ironic glimpses of political hypocrisy are contrasted with the heartbreaking struggles of common people. Simultaneously outraged and humorous, the layered tales bear witness to the universal adversities of these times and humanity's existence in their face.","Yours,Etcetera",Ikhtisad Ahmed, , ,Bengal Lights Books,9789849172215,"1st Published,2015",135,Bangladesh,English

A man returns home in search of his wife and son after the war, only to find them in ways both unexpected and expected. A sorcerer dies without revealing his secrets to three brothers who wanted to know, and strange deaths follow. A young boy waits for his grandfather to die.

These twelve stories by Hasan Azizul Huq make a substantial selection of his powerful, socially-conscious writing available to the Anglophone reader. Highly regarded throughout the Bengali-speaking world, Huq is unique in his harrowing portrayal of the deprived echelons of Bengali society.



ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Born in 1939 in the Burdwan district of West Bengal, Hasan Azizul Huq matriculated from the high school in his village before emigrating to what is now Bangladesh. After completing his undergraduate and graduate studies in philosophy, he taught in several colleges before joining the philosophy faculty of Rajshahi University. A prolific writer of novels, short stories and essays, he has published over two dozen books and has won the most prestigious awards in the Bengali-speaking world, among them the Bangla Academy Prize, the Ekushey Padak, and the Ananda Purashkar.

Bangladesh 1971. Burnt and destroyed. Like a crematorium. Piles of corpses. Torture cells. Barbarian Pak army versus helpless Bengali common people. Syed Shamsul Haq’s two novellas are breathing, glaring bystanders of the war.

In ‘Blue Venom,’ a middle-aged employee of a private firm is arrested on the morning of 27th March and taken to a torture cell. There, he is tortured slowly to death – only for being a namesake of the rebel poet Kazi Nazrul Islam. Not only the viciousness of the captors but also their ignorance lies exposed.

In ‘Forbidden Incense,’ a woman returns to her paternal village after her journalist husband has been made to disappear on the night of the 25th of March. Here she meets a boy with a Muslim name – his entire family has been killed by the Pakistani army. The village has turned into a slaughterhouse. They are caught while gathering the corpses scattered everywhere to give them a decent burial. National and personal histories mingle.

Syed Shamsul Haq's flowing depiction of 1971 through the living language of these two novellas make readers who haven’t witnessed the war relive the terror and disgust of the sufferers.",Library Of Bangladesh Presents: Syed Shamsul Haq, ,Saugata Ghosh,Arunava Sinha,Bengal Lights Books,9789849172253,"1st Published,2015",121,Bangladesh,English
