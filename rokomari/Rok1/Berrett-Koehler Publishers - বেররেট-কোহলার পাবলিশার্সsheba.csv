The legendary Eat That Frog! (more than 1.5 million copies sold worldwide and translated into 42 languages) will change your life.

Stop Procrastinating, Get More of the Important Things Done—Today!

There just isn't enough time for everything on our to-do list—and there never will be. Successful people don't try to do everything. They learn to focus on the most important tasks and make sure those get done. They eat their frogs.

There's an old saying that if the first thing you do each morning is eat a live frog, you'll have the satisfaction of knowing you're done with the worst thing you'll have to do all day. For Tracy, eating a frog is a metaphor for tackling your most challenging task—but also the one that can have the greatest positive impact on your life. Eat That Frog! – Snapshots shows you how to organize each day so you can zero in on these critical tasks and accomplish them efficiently and effectively.

In this fully redesigned and illustrative edition, Tracy explains how you can use technology to remind yourself of what is most important and protect yourself from what is least important. 
But one thing remains unchanged: Brian Tracy cuts to the core of what is vital to effective time management: decision, discipline, and determination. This life-changing book will ensure that you get more of your important tasks done—today!",Eat That Frog!: 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time,Brian Tracy, , ,Berrett-Koehler Publishers,9781523095131,2017,120,India,English
Collaboration Begins With You,ব্লাঞ্চার্ড কে,"",TK. 630,https://rokomari.com//book/173436/collaboration-begins-with-you,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/6a722f7b3_173436.jpg,"'Collaboration Begins With You' Summary of the book
Everyone knows collaboration creates high performing teams and organizations—and with today’s diverse, globalized workforce it’s absolutely crucial. Yet it often doesn’t happen because people and groups typically believe that the problem is always outside: the other team member, the other department, the other company. Bestselling author Ken Blanchard and his coauthors use Blanchard’s signature business parable style to show that, in fact, if collaboration is to succeed it must begin with you. 

This book teaches people at all levels—from new associates to top executives—that it’s up to each of us to help promote and preserve a winning culture of collaboration. The authors show that busting silos and bringing people together is an inside-out process that involves the heart (your character and intentions), the head (your beliefs and attitudes), and the hands (your actions and behaviors). Working with this three-part approach, Collaboration Begins with You helps readers develop a collaborative culture that uses differences to spur contribution and creativity; provides a safe and trusting environment; involves everyone in creating a clear sense of purpose, values, and goals; encourages people to share information; and turns everyone into an empowered self-leader. 

None of us is as smart as all of us. When people recognize their own erroneous beliefs regarding collaboration and work to change them, silos are broken down, failures are turned into successes, and breakthrough results are achieved at every level.",Collaboration Begins With You,"Blenchard Ken,Ripley Jane,Parisi Eunice,Carew", , ,Berrett-Koehler Publishers,9781626568617,"1st Edition,2016",350,India,English
