Book info
Recently in Bangladesh, Fisheries department and Environmental Science department are opening in new and old universities but it is a matter of great regret that there is a lack of good dictionary in Fisheries and Environmental Science which would meet the demand of university students and teachers. With a view to produce a high quality dictionary in multi-disciplinary and integrated subjects like Fisheries and Environmental Science, “Concise Dictionary of Fisheries and Environmental Science” has been published. The dictionary covers the field of Fisheries and Environmental Science in a concise, clear, authoritative, up-to-date manner, addressing the need for understanding and accurate use of terms, particularly when communicating scientific information. The concise version contains around 5,000 entries and the aim has been to produce a concise version that meets the day-to-day needs of university students, teachers and professionals working in the field of Fisheries and Environmental Science. As both Fisheries and Environmental Science are multi-disciplinary subjects, this book intend to cover the whole area of Fisheries, Zoology, Ecology, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Physics, Physiology, Limnology, Oceanography, Microbiology, Parasitology, Genetics, Geography, Soil Science, Economics, Sociology, Extension, Resource Management and Engineering. Users will find that the “terms” in this book is used in every class, seminar, symposium, conference and workshop. In a nutshell, whoever interested in Fisheries and Environmental Science would find this book very useful and I hope it would become a frequently consulted, informative, practical guide to the subjects. The success of my efforts is, of course, for users to determine and I would appreciate any comments that might help me to improve future editions.",Concise Dictionary of Fisheries and Environmental Science,Mohammad Mamun Chowdhury, , ,BdFish Team, , , ,Bangladesh,English
