This might seem to disqualify me as his biographer, and I certainly had no notion of being one. One day, while speaking
to him, I asked him if he had a message for young Indians. His message fascinated me. Later, I mustered the courage to ask him about his recollections so that I could pen them down before they were buried irretrievably under the sands of time.
We had a long series of sittings late into the night and early under the fading stars of dawn-all somehow stolen from his very busy schedule of eighteen hours a day. The profundity and range of his ideas mesmerized me. He had tremendous vitality and obviously received immense pleasure from the world of ideas. His conversation was not always easy to follow, but was always fresh and stimulating. There were complexities, subtleties, and intriguing metaphors and subplots in his narrative, but gradually the unfolding of his brilliant mind took the form of a continuous discourse.
When I sat downto write this book, I felt that it required greater skills than I possessed. But realising the importance of this task and regarding it an honour to have been permitted to attemptit, I prayed earnestly for the courage and calibre to complete it.
This book is written for the ordinary people of India for whom Dr Kalam has an immense affection, and of whom Dr Kalam is certainly one. He has an intuitive rapport with the humblest and simplest people, an indication of his own simplicity and innate Spirituality.
For myself, writing this book has been like a pilgrimage. Through Dr Kalam, I was blessed with the revelation that the real joy of living can be found in only one way-in one's communion with an eternal source of hidden knowledge within oneselfwhich each individual is bidden to seek and find for himself or herself. Many of you may never meet Dr Kalam in person, but I hope you will enjoy his company through this book, and that he will become your spiritual friend.
I could include in this book only a few incidents among the many narrated to me by Dr Kalam. In fact, this book provides only a thumbnail sketch of Dr Kalam's life. It is quite possible that certain important incidents have been inadvertently dropped and that the contribution of some individuals to the projects coordinated by Dr Kalam has gone unrecorded. Since a quartercentury of professional life separates me from Dr Kalam, some important issues might also have remained unrecorded or have been distorted. I am solely responsible for such shortcomings, which are, of course, completely unintentional.

When the manuscript of India Wins Freedom was handed over to us for publication by the late Professor Humayun Kabir in September 1958, seven months after Maulana Azad's sudden death, we were informed that a fuller version containing additional material of about thirty pages would be made available to us for publication on 22 February 1988, the thirtieth death anniversary of Maulana Azad. However, when the time came, the handing over of the complete text got delayed because of various issues raised by persons claiming an interest in the matter. These issues were heard by the Calcutta High Court, the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court, before Justice B.N. Kirpal of the Delhi High Court directed on 29 September 1988 that a copy each of the text deposited in the National Library, Calcutta, and in the National Archives, New Delhi, be handed over to Orient Longman on 29 September 1988. The court further directed that the material should be reproduced without any alteration, after comparing the copies to ensure that they were identical. This has been done.
On examining the material, it became apparent that the additional matter was not just an extra thirty pages as generally believed but was to be foundscattered throughout the text. Also, apart from phrases, sentence sequences and series of passages left out of the published text, the original text had been modified at many places by Professor Kabir's editorial intervention (see his note in Appendix 1). The present edition now gives the full text as found in the copies released to us. Major additions to the earlier version are indicated by asterisks at the beginning and at the end. The ""Prospectus of the First Volume' as published in the first edition has been retained. The appendixes included in that edition have also been reproduced.

The book sets forth the argument that the brilliant variety and complexities of life can be explained by the theory of natural selection and evolution rather than by some grand design by an omniscient and all-powerful being.


The God Delusion uses the idea of memes to explain the prevalence of belief in God across all cultural, racial, and geographical divisions. A meme is an idea, or behavior that spreads within a culture. It is viewed as a cultural analogy of a gene - something that replicates itself, mutates, and is passed on. Dawkins asserts that these memes of religious ideas spread across different societies like viruses because of the human mind’s susceptibility to the idea of a God.


The book also delves into the issue of morality. It states that humanity does not need religion to instill moral values. According to the author, morality is the result of altruistic genes. The author asserts that most people still wouldn’t commit murder or other crimes if the existence of God were to be completely disproved.


The God Delusion does not just put forward a defense of atheism, but states that religion is the cause of the many evils in society, and that religion fosters fanaticism and narrow-mindedness. The author takes a strong stance against teaching religious ideas in schools. Dawkins asserts that he does not intend to provide proof against the existence of God. The book puts forward an argument that a universe without God is better than a universe with an all-powerful God.


About Richard Dawkins


Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist and an author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford. The publication of his first book, The Selfish Gene, which introduced the term meme, made him a popular personality.


Dawkins’ other books include The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach Of The Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, Climbing Mount Improbable, River Out of Eden, and The Selfish Gene.


Dawkins was born in 1941 in Nairobi, Kenya. He is well known for his atheistic views and his criticism of creationist ideas and the idea of intelligent design that presumes the existence of an intelligent being behind the design.",God Delusion,Richard Dawkins, , ,Orient Blackswan,9780552773317,"1st Edition,2007",464,India,English

David Copperfield is a fictional biography, describing the title character’s life. David narrates the novel himself. Some of the information in the novel is autobiographical and relates to Charles Dickens’s own life. David had a difficult life from the beginning. His father died before he was born. When David’s mother remarries, his stepfather is abusive and sends him off to a boarding school overseen by a cruel and abusive headmaster. One positive outcome of the school is that David makes two close friends. David’s mother dies when he is twelve, and his stepfather sends him off to live with the Micawber family in London and work in his stepfather’s warehouse. David is unhappy working at the warehouse and runs away to his Aunt Betsy. His aunt sends him to live with the Wickfield family and attend a school in Canterbury. Although he loves Agnes Wickfield, David ends up falling in love with Dora Spenlow, the daughter of an attorney who tutors David. The Wickfields’ law clerk, Uriah Heep, is revealed by David’s friends to be stealing from Mr. Wickfield. The Micawbers end up moving to Australia, while David becomes a writer. When Dora dies, David marries Agnes Wickfield. (enotes.com)",David Copperfield,Charles Dickens, , ,Orient Blackswan,9788125039587,"1st Edition,2010",200,India,English

Zen, from its foundation in China of the 6th Century A.D., has always been more than a religion. It is an intriguing system of principles and practices designed to give each individual the experience of eternity in a split second, the knowledge of divinity in every living thing.

To create a book about Zen, however, is risky. It is one thing to describe the factual history of this exotic strain of Buddhism. It’s quite another thing to successfully convey the crazy wisdom of the Zen masters, their zany sense of humor, and their uncanny ability to pass on the experience of enlightenment to their students.

The authors of Zen For Beginners have clearly overcome these considerable risks. The book uses an engaging mix of clear, informative writing and delightful illustrations to document the story of Zen from its impact on Chinese and Japanese culture to its influence on American writers such as Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and Gary Snyder. The paradoxical teaching stories and style of the Zen master are also shown as important keys to understanding Oriental art, literature, architecture, and attitudes towards life and death.",Zen : For Beginners,"Judith Blackstone,Zoran Josipovic", , ,Orient Blackswan,8125020489,"Reprint,2003",167,Abroad,English

Did you know that a child can recognise the mother's voice after than a day? Or that the first English dictionary was published in 1604 to educate Ladies, Gentle women or any other unskillful persons?

English Language For Beginners covers the history of English right from Anglo-Saxon times and unravels the mystery of how children acquire language. It examines the role of language in modern society and its relationship to sex, race and class. And it looks at how English has spread, changed and become a global language of many colours and varieties.

Everyday more and more people are learning English, today the figure stands at over billion people. That's over a fifth of the world's population and they should all read this book! It is an ideal study for the English Language student and a truly enlightening introduction for everyday else... if you speak English, this is the book for you.

If you need more convincing, here's what Professor David Crystal (author of The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language, Listen to Your Child and lots of other good books) has to say about it.

'I was delighted to read this witty and ingenious account. It will be of great help to anyone making a first encounter with English Language.'

800 million people live under the constant threat of famine. Most are fod-producing peasants in the Third World. The baffling question is why are so many food producers, rather than we, their consumers, the first to go hungry?
About Author :
Susan George takes a cold, clear look at the facts and myths of food production, and provides answers. She considers its history, from its origin 10,000 years ago to the Global Supermarket of today. Cliches and half-truths about over-population, climate and inefficient farming, usually given as the reason for Thrid World hunger, are discarded. She exposes the ruthless game of multinational agri-business, the methods of new Malthusianism and neo-colonialism. She unmasks pious aid programmes and reveals the basis of further exploitation.
Food for Beginners is a disturbing book: the facts are grim, the picture bleak. But the wit, sheer logic and force of this documentary comic book, point beyond despair to justice.",Food : For Beginners,Susan George, , ,Orient Blackswan,9788125031970,1st Edition,172,Abroad,English

In three decades, his novel One hundred years of Solitude has sold over twenty million copies in more than thirty languages, to become the most famous and widely read novel in Spanish since Cervantes Don Quixote.
Garcia Marquez For Beginners introduces readers to the man and his magical realism, a style that expresses Latin American life and culture in many different layers of human perception. Garcia Marquez has pledged that everything he writes comes out of the real world, including gypsies on flying carpets, a woman ascending to heaven, body and soul, and a priest who levitates when he drinks chocolate.

Their preference for blondes, if Marilyn's life is anything to go by, seems to be connected with sexual abuse and control. Hollywood both liberated and entrapped Marilyn and then attempted to destroy her.
In Marilyn for Beginners. Marilyn speaks for herself to her psychologist, to a reporter, and ultimately to the reader of this book. Marilyn's story begins with her childhood, made easy and insecure by her unstable motehr. She then traces her rise to stardom, progressing through the murky realities of the Hollowood Dream Factory and the heavy price she paid for fame and fortune.

So it is easy to see why some people consider him a genius. But others ....
Put it this way: Some people are so good that all we can do is look up to them. He was a great man who made great mistakes. The two most (in) famous events in Jung's life were his break with Freud and his sojourn with the Nazis. Most book on Jung minimize his Nazi period. Author and psychologist Jon Platania, finds Nazism too hideous to minimize, so he tells this part of the story without pulling any punches.
About Author :

Psychology Center at the University of California. He is a graduate of the Psychotherapy Institute. He is an integrative analytic psychologist and a student of the mind-body relationship He teaches yoga in Berkeley.

This might seem to disqualify me as his biographer, and I certainly had no notion of being one. One day, while speaking
to him, I asked him if he had a message for young Indians. His message fascinated me. Later, I mustered the courage to ask him about his recollections so that I could pen them down before they were buried irretrievably under the sands of time.
We had a long series of sittings late into the night and early under the fading stars of dawn-all somehow stolen from his very busy schedule of eighteen hours a day. The profundity and range of his ideas mesmerized me. He had tremendous vitality and obviously received immense pleasure from the world of ideas. His conversation was not always easy to follow, but was always fresh and stimulating. There were complexities, subtleties, and intriguing metaphors and subplots in his narrative, but gradually the unfolding of his brilliant mind took the form of a continuous discourse.
When I sat downto write this book, I felt that it required greater skills than I possessed. But realising the importance of this task and regarding it an honour to have been permitted to attemptit, I prayed earnestly for the courage and calibre to complete it.
This book is written for the ordinary people of India for whom Dr Kalam has an immense affection, and of whom Dr Kalam is certainly one. He has an intuitive rapport with the humblest and simplest people, an indication of his own simplicity and innate Spirituality.
For myself, writing this book has been like a pilgrimage. Through Dr Kalam, I was blessed with the revelation that the real joy of living can be found in only one way-in one's communion with an eternal source of hidden knowledge within oneselfwhich each individual is bidden to seek and find for himself or herself. Many of you may never meet Dr Kalam in person, but I hope you will enjoy his company through this book, and that he will become your spiritual friend.
I could include in this book only a few incidents among the many narrated to me by Dr Kalam. In fact, this book provides only a thumbnail sketch of Dr Kalam's life. It is quite possible that certain important incidents have been inadvertently dropped and that the contribution of some individuals to the projects coordinated by Dr Kalam has gone unrecorded. Since a quartercentury of professional life separates me from Dr Kalam, some important issues might also have remained unrecorded or have been distorted. I am solely responsible for such shortcomings, which are, of course, completely unintentional.

When the manuscript of India Wins Freedom was handed over to us for publication by the late Professor Humayun Kabir in September 1958, seven months after Maulana Azad's sudden death, we were informed that a fuller version containing additional material of about thirty pages would be made available to us for publication on 22 February 1988, the thirtieth death anniversary of Maulana Azad. However, when the time came, the handing over of the complete text got delayed because of various issues raised by persons claiming an interest in the matter. These issues were heard by the Calcutta High Court, the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court, before Justice B.N. Kirpal of the Delhi High Court directed on 29 September 1988 that a copy each of the text deposited in the National Library, Calcutta, and in the National Archives, New Delhi, be handed over to Orient Longman on 29 September 1988. The court further directed that the material should be reproduced without any alteration, after comparing the copies to ensure that they were identical. This has been done.
On examining the material, it became apparent that the additional matter was not just an extra thirty pages as generally believed but was to be foundscattered throughout the text. Also, apart from phrases, sentence sequences and series of passages left out of the published text, the original text had been modified at many places by Professor Kabir's editorial intervention (see his note in Appendix 1). The present edition now gives the full text as found in the copies released to us. Major additions to the earlier version are indicated by asterisks at the beginning and at the end. The ""Prospectus of the First Volume' as published in the first edition has been retained. The appendixes included in that edition have also been reproduced.

The book sets forth the argument that the brilliant variety and complexities of life can be explained by the theory of natural selection and evolution rather than by some grand design by an omniscient and all-powerful being.


The God Delusion uses the idea of memes to explain the prevalence of belief in God across all cultural, racial, and geographical divisions. A meme is an idea, or behavior that spreads within a culture. It is viewed as a cultural analogy of a gene - something that replicates itself, mutates, and is passed on. Dawkins asserts that these memes of religious ideas spread across different societies like viruses because of the human mind’s susceptibility to the idea of a God.


The book also delves into the issue of morality. It states that humanity does not need religion to instill moral values. According to the author, morality is the result of altruistic genes. The author asserts that most people still wouldn’t commit murder or other crimes if the existence of God were to be completely disproved.


The God Delusion does not just put forward a defense of atheism, but states that religion is the cause of the many evils in society, and that religion fosters fanaticism and narrow-mindedness. The author takes a strong stance against teaching religious ideas in schools. Dawkins asserts that he does not intend to provide proof against the existence of God. The book puts forward an argument that a universe without God is better than a universe with an all-powerful God.


About Richard Dawkins


Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist and an author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford. The publication of his first book, The Selfish Gene, which introduced the term meme, made him a popular personality.


Dawkins’ other books include The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach Of The Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, Climbing Mount Improbable, River Out of Eden, and The Selfish Gene.


Dawkins was born in 1941 in Nairobi, Kenya. He is well known for his atheistic views and his criticism of creationist ideas and the idea of intelligent design that presumes the existence of an intelligent being behind the design.",God Delusion,Richard Dawkins, , ,Orient Blackswan,9780552773317,"1st Edition,2007",464,India,English

David Copperfield is a fictional biography, describing the title character’s life. David narrates the novel himself. Some of the information in the novel is autobiographical and relates to Charles Dickens’s own life. David had a difficult life from the beginning. His father died before he was born. When David’s mother remarries, his stepfather is abusive and sends him off to a boarding school overseen by a cruel and abusive headmaster. One positive outcome of the school is that David makes two close friends. David’s mother dies when he is twelve, and his stepfather sends him off to live with the Micawber family in London and work in his stepfather’s warehouse. David is unhappy working at the warehouse and runs away to his Aunt Betsy. His aunt sends him to live with the Wickfield family and attend a school in Canterbury. Although he loves Agnes Wickfield, David ends up falling in love with Dora Spenlow, the daughter of an attorney who tutors David. The Wickfields’ law clerk, Uriah Heep, is revealed by David’s friends to be stealing from Mr. Wickfield. The Micawbers end up moving to Australia, while David becomes a writer. When Dora dies, David marries Agnes Wickfield. (enotes.com)",David Copperfield,Charles Dickens, , ,Orient Blackswan,9788125039587,"1st Edition,2010",200,India,English

Zen, from its foundation in China of the 6th Century A.D., has always been more than a religion. It is an intriguing system of principles and practices designed to give each individual the experience of eternity in a split second, the knowledge of divinity in every living thing.

To create a book about Zen, however, is risky. It is one thing to describe the factual history of this exotic strain of Buddhism. It’s quite another thing to successfully convey the crazy wisdom of the Zen masters, their zany sense of humor, and their uncanny ability to pass on the experience of enlightenment to their students.

The authors of Zen For Beginners have clearly overcome these considerable risks. The book uses an engaging mix of clear, informative writing and delightful illustrations to document the story of Zen from its impact on Chinese and Japanese culture to its influence on American writers such as Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and Gary Snyder. The paradoxical teaching stories and style of the Zen master are also shown as important keys to understanding Oriental art, literature, architecture, and attitudes towards life and death.",Zen : For Beginners,"Judith Blackstone,Zoran Josipovic", , ,Orient Blackswan,8125020489,"Reprint,2003",167,Abroad,English

Did you know that a child can recognise the mother's voice after than a day? Or that the first English dictionary was published in 1604 to educate Ladies, Gentle women or any other unskillful persons?

English Language For Beginners covers the history of English right from Anglo-Saxon times and unravels the mystery of how children acquire language. It examines the role of language in modern society and its relationship to sex, race and class. And it looks at how English has spread, changed and become a global language of many colours and varieties.

Everyday more and more people are learning English, today the figure stands at over billion people. That's over a fifth of the world's population and they should all read this book! It is an ideal study for the English Language student and a truly enlightening introduction for everyday else... if you speak English, this is the book for you.

If you need more convincing, here's what Professor David Crystal (author of The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language, Listen to Your Child and lots of other good books) has to say about it.

'I was delighted to read this witty and ingenious account. It will be of great help to anyone making a first encounter with English Language.'

800 million people live under the constant threat of famine. Most are fod-producing peasants in the Third World. The baffling question is why are so many food producers, rather than we, their consumers, the first to go hungry?
About Author :
Susan George takes a cold, clear look at the facts and myths of food production, and provides answers. She considers its history, from its origin 10,000 years ago to the Global Supermarket of today. Cliches and half-truths about over-population, climate and inefficient farming, usually given as the reason for Thrid World hunger, are discarded. She exposes the ruthless game of multinational agri-business, the methods of new Malthusianism and neo-colonialism. She unmasks pious aid programmes and reveals the basis of further exploitation.
Food for Beginners is a disturbing book: the facts are grim, the picture bleak. But the wit, sheer logic and force of this documentary comic book, point beyond despair to justice.",Food : For Beginners,Susan George, , ,Orient Blackswan,9788125031970,1st Edition,172,Abroad,English

In three decades, his novel One hundred years of Solitude has sold over twenty million copies in more than thirty languages, to become the most famous and widely read novel in Spanish since Cervantes Don Quixote.
Garcia Marquez For Beginners introduces readers to the man and his magical realism, a style that expresses Latin American life and culture in many different layers of human perception. Garcia Marquez has pledged that everything he writes comes out of the real world, including gypsies on flying carpets, a woman ascending to heaven, body and soul, and a priest who levitates when he drinks chocolate.

Their preference for blondes, if Marilyn's life is anything to go by, seems to be connected with sexual abuse and control. Hollywood both liberated and entrapped Marilyn and then attempted to destroy her.
In Marilyn for Beginners. Marilyn speaks for herself to her psychologist, to a reporter, and ultimately to the reader of this book. Marilyn's story begins with her childhood, made easy and insecure by her unstable motehr. She then traces her rise to stardom, progressing through the murky realities of the Hollowood Dream Factory and the heavy price she paid for fame and fortune.

So it is easy to see why some people consider him a genius. But others ....
Put it this way: Some people are so good that all we can do is look up to them. He was a great man who made great mistakes. The two most (in) famous events in Jung's life were his break with Freud and his sojourn with the Nazis. Most book on Jung minimize his Nazi period. Author and psychologist Jon Platania, finds Nazism too hideous to minimize, so he tells this part of the story without pulling any punches.
About Author :
Jon Platania is a clinical and health psychologist in private practice in Berkeley. He completed his PhD at the Wright Institute and his post-doctoral training at the
Psychology Center at the University of California. He is a graduate of the Psychotherapy Institute. He is an integrative analytic psychologist and a student of the mind-body relationship He teaches yoga in Berkeley.
