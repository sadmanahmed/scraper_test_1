Peter Delvecchio is the manager of an ice cream company and he is planning to make a big sale to Natural Foods, a leading chain of grocery stores. In his interactions with the manager at Natural Foods, Peter begins to see how their stores are always able to maintain such high standards of operations. The food chain not only excelled at manufacturing high quality goods but also succeeded in providing equally good service to its customers. He soon realizes that quality can be achieved if only the manager learnt to listen, enrich, and optimize.

Through the story of Peter, Chowdhury has introduced his ideas on quality management. He feels that even though America excels at innovation and crafting innovative new products, it often loses market share to Europe and Asia because of unsteady quality. He has talked about his Listen-Enrich-Optimize (LEO) approach as a means of successfully achieving quality goals. Through The Ice Cream Maker, he provides a model to excel at quality for businesses everywhere.",Ice Cream Maker,Subir Chowdhury, , ,Doubleday,9780385519779,"1st,2014",128,India,English
