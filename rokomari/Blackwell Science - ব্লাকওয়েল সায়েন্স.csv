The incidence of the condition is increasing as the average age of the population moves upward, and greater emphasis on audit has meant that surgeons are under ever-increasing pressure to release hospital beds as quickly as possible. This book aims to review the existing literature as well as to provide clear and practical guidance for both the practising orthopaedic surgeon and the trainee, who is frequently left to deal with the major workload of hip fractures.",Hip Fracture Management  (Trade Cloth),"Martyn J.
