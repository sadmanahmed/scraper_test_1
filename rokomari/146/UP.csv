This book deals with an important area  in mathematics - problem solving - making it an excitingadventure. Having  been associated with the Mathematical Olympiad programmesince  its inception in India, the author has drawn a lot on thisexperience in terms of material as well as in terms of the lucid style ofwriting. In Adventures In Problem Solving, which is addressed to problem buffs, you will find manytopics in “serious” and “recreational” mathematics developed throughproblems (surds, logarithms, geometry, inequalities, magic squares, cryptarithms,logic, counting, number theory, games such as Nim, . . .). It will beparticularly useful to students who wish to appear for the MathematicalOlympiads.",Adventures in Problem Solving,Shailesh. Shirali, , ,UP,9788173714139,"1st Edition,2002",328,India,English

This book is designed to serve as a textbook for undergraduate students of maths, physics, physical chemistry, engineering, etc. throughout India. There is rigorous coverage of the theory and a number of application-oriented problems drawn from various disciplines such as science, medicine, economics and agriculture. It also contains a large number of worked examples besides exercises and answers. One chapter is devoted to numerical techniques to solve differential equations in which computer programs and printouts of worked examples are included.",Differential Equations with Applications,"Rao,Balachandran", , ,UP,9788173710230,"1st Edition,2013",416,India,English

The book deals with mathematical concepts from high school onwards. It discusses Pythagoras’ Theorem, logarithms, prime numbers, Pi, Fibonacci sequence and its variations, how to multiply extremely large integers, the Gregorian calendar, how a PC can be programmed using BASIC, number systems such as decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal systems, and finally how string variables in the BASIC language can convert figures (in a cheque for example) into words.",Explorations in Mathematics,"Hattangadi,A.

This book aims to inspire people by the beauty of mathematics and not necessarily its usefulness, as is most often the case when trying to motivate youngsters to the subject. When one meets people socially and they discover that one's field of interest is mathematics, we are usually confronted with the proud exclamation: ""Oh, I was always terrible in math!"" For no other subject in the curriculum would an adult be so proud about failure. Having been weak in mathematics is a badge of honour. Why is this so? Are people embarrassed to admit competence in this area? And why are so many people really weak in mathematics? What can be done to change this trend? Were anyone to have the definitive answer to this question, he or she would be the nation's education superstar. We can only conjecture where the problem lies; and then from that perspective, hope to repair it. It is the author's strong belief that the root of the problem lies in the inherent unpopularity of mathematics. But why is it so unpopular? Those who use mathematics are fine with it, but those who do not have a daily need for it can be led to appreciate it for its beauty, and not only for its usefulness. This, then, is the objective of this book; to provide sufficient evidence of the beauty of mathematics through many examples in a variety of its branches. To make these examples attractive and effective, they were selected on the basis of the ease with which they can be understood at first reading.",Math Charmers,"Weaver,J H", , ,UP,9788173715624,"1st Edition,2009",302,India,English

This book deals with tests of divisibility and the rich theory behind them. Along the way, the reader will study a subject called Number Theory. To study this book, all that is required is familiarity with elementary arithmetic and algebra (addition and subtraction of algebraic expressions, the laws of exponents, the idea of prime factorization of an integer, the notion of relative primeness of two integers, etc.); in short, material which would normally  be covered in grades 7–9 in most countries. Plenty of exercises are scattered throughout the book, with solutions at the end.",First Steps in Number Theory: A Primer on Divisibility,Shailesh A, , ,UP,9788173713682,"1st Edition,2000",170,India,English
