Oscillations play a very important part in modern Physics, and a.c. theory, important as it is in its own right, provides the best introduction to the techniques common to all oscillatory problems. For this reason, this text is oriented towards the needs of science students, and also provides a first course for Electrical Engineering students. An elementary knowledge of field and d.c. circuit theory is assumed. The text provides two courses. A short course, covered in Chapters One to Six, is for those students who do not wish to proceed to the operator j methods treated in later Chapters. The complete course provides the minimum requirements for a graduate in Physics. The book gives a thorough grounding in the fundamental concepts as the basis of such a course.",Introductory AC Circuit Theory,Mann K., , ,University Press,9788173713255,"1st Edition,2000",224,India,English
