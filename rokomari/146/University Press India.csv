This book provides an introduction to the field of knowledge management. Taking a learning-centric rather than information-centric approach, it emphasizes the continuous acquisition and application of knowledge. The book is organized into three sections, each opening with a classic work from a leader in the field. The first section, Strategy, discusses the motivation for knowledge management and how to structure a knowledge management program. The second section, Process, discusses the use of knowledge management to make existing practices more effective, the speeding up of organizational learning, and effective methods for implementing knowledge management. The third section, Metrics, discusses how to measure the impact of knowledge management on an organization. In addition to the classic essays, each section contains unpublished works that further develop the foundational concepts and strategies.",Knowledge Management: Classic and Contemporary Works,Daryl Morey, , ,University Press India,9788173713903,"1st Edition,2010",456,Abroad,English

This selection of problems in Group Theory is principally aimed at undergraduate and postgraduate students of mathematics. Excepting a few, these problems are meant only to supplement the existing ones in standard texts. This comments interspersed in the text helop to put the problems in perspective with other probelms and with the subejct itself.

About Author : 
B Sury has been at the Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore since 1999. Many of the problems in this selection are from a collection he built up during 1981 -1999 while he was at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai.

This book introduces the subject of molecular electrostatics to postgraduate students, teachers and young researchers in chemistry, physics and biology. It discusses rigorous as well as applied aspects of the molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) and provides an essence of relevant mathematical arguments, without going into detailed derivations. A number of colour illustrations highlight the salient features of MESP.",Electrostatics of Atoms and Molecules,Shirsat, , ,University Press India,9788173712968,"1st Edition,2001",144,Abroad,English

This book attempts to broadly deal with the mechanics and dynamics of the Solar System with additional emphasis on celestial mechanics. Important planetary laws and theories like the Geocentric Theory, Kepler’s Laws, Newton’s law of gravitation, the catastrophic theories of Moulten, Russel and Schmidt, and the nebular hypothesis of Kant and Laplace are clearly explained. The book also deals with space dynamics and rocket propulsion, solar activities, lunar studies, small bodies and extraterrestrial life.",Astrophysics of the Solar System,"Abhyankar,K.D.", , ,University Press India,9788173711244,"1st Edition,2000",272,Abroad,English

The phenomenon of combustion, seemingly so simple and present almost in all spheres of our lives, is a fascinatingly complex process that involves elements of chemistry, thermodynamics, and fluid mechanics. In Understanding Combustion, the author takes on the task of revealing its myriad aspects for the benefit of a general reader with a background in science. The narrative introduces the reader to the process of combustion happening everywhere, in the domestic, industrial and scientific spheres and then goes on to explain the aspects of engineering design involved in the control of the process. From a simple candle flame to cooking stoves to combustion in hybrid rocket engines, the book looks at combustion in varied fuel media, examines the chemistry behind it, analyses the stability of the process and the modelling of combustion devices. In this revised edition, three new chapters on gasification of solid fuels, emission of pollutants and explosion and detonation have been included to expand the field of discourse to recent developments and also cover practical issues related to conservation of fuels and environmental degradation. This book would be of interest to students of science and technology.",Understanding Combustion,H.S. Mukunda, , ,University Press India,9788173716850,"2nd Edition,2009",184,Abroad,English
