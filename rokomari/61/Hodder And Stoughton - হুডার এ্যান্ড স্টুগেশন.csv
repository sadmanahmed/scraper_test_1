The Litigators is about a two-partner Chicago law firm attempting to strike it rich in a class action lawsuit over a cholesterol reduction drug by a major pharmaceutical drug company. The protagonist is a Harvard Law School grad big law firm burnout who stumbles upon the boutique and joins it only to find himself litigating against his old law firm in this case. The book is regarded as more humorous than most of Grisham's prior novels.

Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are the bickering partners of a small law firm in the South Side of Chicago. Oscar's character holds the firm together despite the childish and unethical behavior of Wally, his junior partner. David Zinc, a formerly successful attorney, relegates himself to working as an associate with the firm. While Wally goes to a funeral home to attend the wake of a former estate client, the client's son claims that his father was killed by Krayoxx, a cholesterol-lowering drug developed by the fictional pharmaceutical company Varrick Labs.  Ecstatic at the possible monetary returns on the case, the firm finds several former clients who appear to have valid claims about Krayoxx. Oscar and Wally generate publicity in the Chicago Tribune with a picture of their filing; this induces an avalanche of communications and leads them to several additional claimants.

Wally notices a blossoming class action lawsuit against Varrick Labs in Florida, and realizes that if he can find some patients to sign as clients, he can earn a big payday on another firm's coattails.

Water for Elephants is proof that author Sara Gruen understands storytelling techniques. Through her careful research of a fascinating topic—circuses of the 1920s and 1930s—Gruen not only draws readers in, she captures them.

Through the eyes of two versions of Jacob Jankowski—one in his nineties and another in his twenties—readers witness what it was like to fall in love, both with circus animals and with a strong woman. When he is a couple days short of gaining his degree in veterinary science from Cornell University, Jacob learns that his mother and father have been killed in an automobile accident. With this stroke of bad luck, Jacob has his planned future suddenly snatched away. As he stumbles through the next weeks in a daze, numbed not only by the cold winter but also by no longer having any family or home, he sees a train chug by in the night. On a sudden impulse, Jacob jumps aboard. The train is moving toward some unknown destination, and Jacob needs a change. What he is soon to discover is that he has climbed aboard a circus train. But this is no Ringling Brothers or Barnum and Bailey. This is the “Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth,” a misnomer if ever there was one.

The circus world that Jacob has just entered is filled with beguiling characters, not all of them attractive in the same way. First, there is Alan J. Bunkel, referred to as Uncle Al, the owner of the circus. Uncle Al makes no bones about it; his main focus in life is money and power. He wants his rag-tag circus to be as spectacular as the Ringling Brothers, but he is going at it in all the wrong ways. Uncle Al surrounds himself with thugs who will do anything he asks, including murder. And then there is August, the animal trainer, who becomes Jacob’s immediate boss. August has a split personality. On one hand, August takes Jacob under his wing, like a father, because he appreciates Jacob’s veterinary skills. On the other hand, August is a monster. He beats his animals and later beats his wife, Marlena, a circus performer, with whom Jacob falls in love.

These are the main characters, except for Rosie. Rosie is the one elephant in the circus, a wise old beast that only understands Polish. She is smart enough to pull up the stake that holds her in place, stick her trunk into the big container of lemonade when no one is looking, then return with her stake and pound it back into the ground. But she is not smart enough to avoid August, who beats her mercilessly, though she does, in the end, gain her revenge.

At the heart of the novel is a love story: that of a young man and a young, ill-married woman, as well as that of the two young people and the animals that surround them. In the course of telling Jacob and Marlena’s story, Gruen also exposes the relationships between the circus people, the performers and the workers, who are tied together by their need to survive during the economic hardships of the Great Depression. Most of them put up with Uncle Al’s cruelties because they have nowhere else to go. They sleep in boxcars while the train transports them across the States. They enjoy some good meals under the circus tent, but they seldom receive their promised wages; and they all know that if they come up lame or ill, they are likely to be “red-lighted”—thrown off the train in the middle of the night and left for dead.

There are many times when Jacob’s life is threatened, but readers know he survives because it is the ninety-year-old Jacob who is telling the story. Jacob in his old age provides comic relief as he grumpily moves through his nursing home, wishing he could once again taste fresh fruit or a hamburger as well as a bit of his old circus life.",Water for Elephants: A Novel ,Sara Gruen, , ,Hodder And Stoughton,9780340962725,"1st  edition,2015",418,India,English

Sycamore Row picks up three years after the trial of Carl Lee Hailey, where A Time to Kill left off. Mr. Seth Hubbard instructs one of his employees to meet him by a Sycamore tree on a Sunday afternoon. Upon arriving at the location, the employee finds his boss dead, hanging by a noose from the branch of the Sycamore tree. Mr. Hubbard decided to end his life because his terminal lung cancer was too painful to cope with. He did, however, leave a very specific set of instructions for his funeral and subsequent burial.

Meanwhile, Jake Brigance is caught up trying to get insurance for his burned down house. His new secretary informs him that a letter from Mr. Seth Hubbard has arrived for him. It is a revised holographic will that renounces his previous one, wherein all his money was to go to his children and grandchildren. In this revised will, Hubbard wishes to leave the bulk of his money to his housekeeper, Letitia Lang, a little to the church and some for his brother. He asserts that his bullheaded children will fight the contents of the will, and Jake is entrusted the responsibility to make sure that doesn’t happen.

A convoluted trail follows thereafter, just as Mr. Hubbard had forewarned. The story proceeds in a fast-paced manner, delving into the details of a fiercely controversial trial. Another exemplary legal thriller by John Grisham, Sycamore Row is a page-turner.

The Racketeer is a novel based on an African American protagonist named Malcolm Bannister, who had been involved in a large real estate transaction for a hunting lodge. He was unaware of the gruesome activities carried out in the hunting lodge, which eventually landed him in the bad books of the FBI. Bannister was arrested and imprisoned, and he had to serve time in jail for a decade, as per the Racketeer Influenced And Corrupt oOrganizations Act (RICO).

The actual story begins five years into Bannister’s term, when he gets divorced and loses his son. He is also disbarred from his profession. However, things seem to take a turn for Bannister with the murder case of a federal judge named Raymond Fogletree. The FBI are unable to crack the case and require his help. Bannister knew a great deal about the murdered judge, including the person who killed him and the things present in the judge’s safe. However, Bannister is willing to help the FBI on one condition only, which is to let him free.

Halfway through this book, Bannister comes to the point where he begins to dictate terms to the FBI. However, he is far from the kind of revenge he desires to take on the government for imprisoning him for a crime he did not commit. Will the FBI be able to crack this mysterious case and release Bannister? This book answers such questions and more.

The Racketeer was released on the 23rd of October, 2012, with an initial print of 1.5 million copies, remaining at the top of bestseller lists for several weeks. Fox 2000 and New Regency have decided to launch a movie adaptation of this novel, with the director Daniel Espinosa.

Joe “Calico” Castle was what every baseball star wanted to be. He was the greatest rookie of them all. The young batter from Calico Rock, Arkansas, won the crowd’s hearts as he tipped his hat to them after each home run. He was on the road to glory, fortune and the Baseball Hall of Fame. One fateful day, everything was going to change. Joe stepped up to bat to replace the first baseman of the Cubs AAA affiliate. A kid in the audience watched with anxiety, for Joe was his hero. He was the son of Warren Tracey, the opposite team’s pitcher. The boy watched as his father walked up to the pitcher’s plate. He was at odds with himself: who should he root for, his father or the batter who’d won his heart? Warren sized up his opponent and threw a fastball that would change their worlds forever. Based on true events, this saga of heart-warming justice sets John Grisham in a new genre, one he masters in style and with panache.

The Litigators is about a two-partner Chicago law firm attempting to strike it rich in a class action lawsuit over a cholesterol reduction drug by a major pharmaceutical drug company. The protagonist is a Harvard Law School grad big law firm burnout who stumbles upon the boutique and joins it only to find himself litigating against his old law firm in this case. The book is regarded as more humorous than most of Grisham's prior novels.

Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are the bickering partners of a small law firm in the South Side of Chicago. Oscar's character holds the firm together despite the childish and unethical behavior of Wally, his junior partner. David Zinc, a formerly successful attorney, relegates himself to working as an associate with the firm. While Wally goes to a funeral home to attend the wake of a former estate client, the client's son claims that his father was killed by Krayoxx, a cholesterol-lowering drug developed by the fictional pharmaceutical company Varrick Labs.  Ecstatic at the possible monetary returns on the case, the firm finds several former clients who appear to have valid claims about Krayoxx. Oscar and Wally generate publicity in the Chicago Tribune with a picture of their filing; this induces an avalanche of communications and leads them to several additional claimants.

Wally notices a blossoming class action lawsuit against Varrick Labs in Florida, and realizes that if he can find some patients to sign as clients, he can earn a big payday on another firm's coattails.

Water for Elephants is proof that author Sara Gruen understands storytelling techniques. Through her careful research of a fascinating topic—circuses of the 1920s and 1930s—Gruen not only draws readers in, she captures them.

Through the eyes of two versions of Jacob Jankowski—one in his nineties and another in his twenties—readers witness what it was like to fall in love, both with circus animals and with a strong woman. When he is a couple days short of gaining his degree in veterinary science from Cornell University, Jacob learns that his mother and father have been killed in an automobile accident. With this stroke of bad luck, Jacob has his planned future suddenly snatched away. As he stumbles through the next weeks in a daze, numbed not only by the cold winter but also by no longer having any family or home, he sees a train chug by in the night. On a sudden impulse, Jacob jumps aboard. The train is moving toward some unknown destination, and Jacob needs a change. What he is soon to discover is that he has climbed aboard a circus train. But this is no Ringling Brothers or Barnum and Bailey. This is the “Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth,” a misnomer if ever there was one.

The circus world that Jacob has just entered is filled with beguiling characters, not all of them attractive in the same way. First, there is Alan J. Bunkel, referred to as Uncle Al, the owner of the circus. Uncle Al makes no bones about it; his main focus in life is money and power. He wants his rag-tag circus to be as spectacular as the Ringling Brothers, but he is going at it in all the wrong ways. Uncle Al surrounds himself with thugs who will do anything he asks, including murder. And then there is August, the animal trainer, who becomes Jacob’s immediate boss. August has a split personality. On one hand, August takes Jacob under his wing, like a father, because he appreciates Jacob’s veterinary skills. On the other hand, August is a monster. He beats his animals and later beats his wife, Marlena, a circus performer, with whom Jacob falls in love.

These are the main characters, except for Rosie. Rosie is the one elephant in the circus, a wise old beast that only understands Polish. She is smart enough to pull up the stake that holds her in place, stick her trunk into the big container of lemonade when no one is looking, then return with her stake and pound it back into the ground. But she is not smart enough to avoid August, who beats her mercilessly, though she does, in the end, gain her revenge.

At the heart of the novel is a love story: that of a young man and a young, ill-married woman, as well as that of the two young people and the animals that surround them. In the course of telling Jacob and Marlena’s story, Gruen also exposes the relationships between the circus people, the performers and the workers, who are tied together by their need to survive during the economic hardships of the Great Depression. Most of them put up with Uncle Al’s cruelties because they have nowhere else to go. They sleep in boxcars while the train transports them across the States. They enjoy some good meals under the circus tent, but they seldom receive their promised wages; and they all know that if they come up lame or ill, they are likely to be “red-lighted”—thrown off the train in the middle of the night and left for dead.

There are many times when Jacob’s life is threatened, but readers know he survives because it is the ninety-year-old Jacob who is telling the story. Jacob in his old age provides comic relief as he grumpily moves through his nursing home, wishing he could once again taste fresh fruit or a hamburger as well as a bit of his old circus life.",Water for Elephants: A Novel ,Sara Gruen, , ,Hodder And Stoughton,9780340962725,"1st  edition,2015",418,India,English

Sycamore Row picks up three years after the trial of Carl Lee Hailey, where A Time to Kill left off. Mr. Seth Hubbard instructs one of his employees to meet him by a Sycamore tree on a Sunday afternoon. Upon arriving at the location, the employee finds his boss dead, hanging by a noose from the branch of the Sycamore tree. Mr. Hubbard decided to end his life because his terminal lung cancer was too painful to cope with. He did, however, leave a very specific set of instructions for his funeral and subsequent burial.

Meanwhile, Jake Brigance is caught up trying to get insurance for his burned down house. His new secretary informs him that a letter from Mr. Seth Hubbard has arrived for him. It is a revised holographic will that renounces his previous one, wherein all his money was to go to his children and grandchildren. In this revised will, Hubbard wishes to leave the bulk of his money to his housekeeper, Letitia Lang, a little to the church and some for his brother. He asserts that his bullheaded children will fight the contents of the will, and Jake is entrusted the responsibility to make sure that doesn’t happen.

A convoluted trail follows thereafter, just as Mr. Hubbard had forewarned. The story proceeds in a fast-paced manner, delving into the details of a fiercely controversial trial. Another exemplary legal thriller by John Grisham, Sycamore Row is a page-turner.

The Racketeer is a novel based on an African American protagonist named Malcolm Bannister, who had been involved in a large real estate transaction for a hunting lodge. He was unaware of the gruesome activities carried out in the hunting lodge, which eventually landed him in the bad books of the FBI. Bannister was arrested and imprisoned, and he had to serve time in jail for a decade, as per the Racketeer Influenced And Corrupt oOrganizations Act (RICO).

The actual story begins five years into Bannister’s term, when he gets divorced and loses his son. He is also disbarred from his profession. However, things seem to take a turn for Bannister with the murder case of a federal judge named Raymond Fogletree. The FBI are unable to crack the case and require his help. Bannister knew a great deal about the murdered judge, including the person who killed him and the things present in the judge’s safe. However, Bannister is willing to help the FBI on one condition only, which is to let him free.

Halfway through this book, Bannister comes to the point where he begins to dictate terms to the FBI. However, he is far from the kind of revenge he desires to take on the government for imprisoning him for a crime he did not commit. Will the FBI be able to crack this mysterious case and release Bannister? This book answers such questions and more.

The Racketeer was released on the 23rd of October, 2012, with an initial print of 1.5 million copies, remaining at the top of bestseller lists for several weeks. Fox 2000 and New Regency have decided to launch a movie adaptation of this novel, with the director Daniel Espinosa.

Joe “Calico” Castle was what every baseball star wanted to be. He was the greatest rookie of them all. The young batter from Calico Rock, Arkansas, won the crowd’s hearts as he tipped his hat to them after each home run. He was on the road to glory, fortune and the Baseball Hall of Fame. One fateful day, everything was going to change. Joe stepped up to bat to replace the first baseman of the Cubs AAA affiliate. A kid in the audience watched with anxiety, for Joe was his hero. He was the son of Warren Tracey, the opposite team’s pitcher. The boy watched as his father walked up to the pitcher’s plate. He was at odds with himself: who should he root for, his father or the batter who’d won his heart? Warren sized up his opponent and threw a fastball that would change their worlds forever. Based on true events, this saga of heart-warming justice sets John Grisham in a new genre, one he masters in style and with panache.
