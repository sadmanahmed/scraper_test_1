Wherever necessary , mathematical equations have been developed using simple integration and differentiation methods to enable the students to understand the concepts easily. Every effort has been exercised to present the concepts in a simple way. A concise description of the biovailabilty of a drug from its formulation has been included at a separate place in the text. Practice questions have been included at the end of chapter to help the students to understand the subject thoroughly.

Thus, it is written in the detailed, step-by-step fashion as a text book. There is some difference of opinion at the present time as to whether current ideas about the nature of matter and the structure of the atom should be assumed and taken as the basis from which the rest of chemistry should be developed or whether the evidence of these accepted views should first be discussed and the logical conclusions developed by them. In this book an attempt has been made to meet both point of view by including a new section, immediately after the introductory historical one, summarizing the present ideas, before embarking upon the succession of sections, setting forth chronologically the accumulation of the evidence. Entire subject matter has been presented as a comprehensive and self-sufficient so that one gets the knowledge systematically from it.
