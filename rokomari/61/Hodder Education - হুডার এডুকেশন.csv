When a biological weapon misfires, it wipes out most of humanity, leaving only a few groups of survivors to try and find a way to pull themselves together. The pandemic has spread uncontrollably despite the efforts of the governments to enforce martial law, and there are but three groups of survivors now. These survivors begin to have visions of a 108 year old woman known as Mother Abigail and follow her instructions to journey to Boulder, Colorado, where they try to restore a democratic society called ""Free Zone."" In Las Vegas, another group of survivors rallies under Randall Flagg, who is trying to set up a brutal government. Flagg is a supernatural being and will stop at nothing until he controls the world. Flagg's group rebuilds quickly, and stockpiles the weapons from all across the country. Mother Abigail's group decides to spy on Flagg, but they're soon discovered and Flagg decides that those who are not with him are against him. If they do not work together, they may yet prove that the weapon has destroyed any chance the world had for survival.",The Stand,Stephen King, , ,Hodder Education,9781444720730,2011,1344,India,English

It, takes places in the town of Derry, where an evil, shape shifting, child-murdering monster, dwells beneath the town’s sewers and storm drains.
In 1958, seven children, who are part of The Loser’s Club, have terrifying encounters with “It”, which assumes the form of their deepest fears.

The most horrifying form is that of a clown known as Pennywise. At the same time, the group’s bond deepens as a result of the constant attacks by Henry Bowers, a neighbourhood bully. The Loser’s Club decide to track down the monster and kill It. After eventually tracking it down, a battle of wills occurs called the Ritual of Chud. The group manage to hurt the creature badly. As they flee It’s lair, the group realizes that their collective power, which defeated the creature, was weakening. To remedy this, Beverly proceeds to strengthen the group’s bond. The group take an oath to return, should the monster return once more.

Then the narrative jumps to 1985, where the murders are occurring once more. Mike Hanlon, the only Loser to have remained in Derry, is convinced that It has returned, and decides to call all the other Losers back, reminding them of their binding promise. By this time, each of the six children has grown into adulthood, and have forgotten about the trauma they experienced as children. All except for Stan Uris, who commits suicide, return to Derry and begin piecing their memories. At the same time, each start to have encounters with the monster. “It”, tries to work through Henry Bowers, who now resides in an asylum, to destroy the Losers. Bowers seriously hurts Mike, but the five remaining members manage to return to the sewers and destroy the evil creature for one last time.

It, was a best selling novel in 1986, in the United States. It won the British Fantasy award in 1987. A television adaptation of the book was made in 1990, featuring John Ritter, and Annette O’Toole. In 2012, it was reported by the The Hollywood Reporter, that the book would be turned into a two part film by director Cary Fukunaga.

Mark, Todd, and Zola came to law school to change the world, to make it a better place. But now, as third-year students, these close friends realize they have been duped. They all borrowed heavily to attend a third-tier, for-profit law school so mediocre that its graduates rarely pass the bar exam, let alone get good jobs. And when they learn that their school is one of a chain owned by a shady New York hedge-fund operator who also happens to own a bank specializing in student loans, the three know they have been caught up in The Great Law School Scam.
     But maybe there's a way out. Maybe there’s a way to escape their crushing debt, expose the bank and the scam, and make a few bucks in the process. But to do so, they would first have to quit school. And leaving law school a few short months before graduation would be completely crazy, right?  Well, yes and no . . .
