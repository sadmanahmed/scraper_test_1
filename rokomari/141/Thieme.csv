Atlas of Anatomy is the student's choice
Thieme is the best anatomy atlas by far, hands down. Clearer pictures, more pictures, more realistic pictures, structures broken up in ways that make sense and shown from every angle...includes clinical correlations and summary charts of innervations and actions. That's about all there is to it. Just buy it. Thank you Thieme!!! Ok, now back to studying...
In my opinion this book surpasses them all. It's the artwork. The artist has found the perfect balance of detail and clarity. Some of these illustrations have to be seen to be believed.... The pearls of clinical information are very good and these add significance to the information and make it easier to remember. Easier to remember is key.

The first part of the book is an overview of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). The natural history, prognostic factors, evaluation and staging are reviewed. The principles of single-modality treatment, surgery and radiotherapy are discussed, emphasizing their limitations and indicating areas in which advances of each of these modalities might be expected. Much attention is given to the biostatistical issues in the design and interpretation of clinical trials of SCCHN. In the second part of this book the principles and applications of the various multi-modality treatments for patients with SCCHN are reviewed. The rationale and treatment strategies of combined surgery and radiotherapy are considered and controversial areas are identified. Multi-modality therapy with chemotherapy in its various settings - neo-adjuvant, adjuvant or synchronous radiotherapy - is critically assessed and strategies including chemotherapy which are most likely to benefit patients are indicated. Finally therapies, which are in development, such as immunobiological therapy and differentiation therapy, are reviewed.",Multimodality Therapy for Head and Neck Cancer (Hardcover),Gordon Brian Snow, , ,Thieme,9783137788010,"1st Edition,1992",200,India,English
