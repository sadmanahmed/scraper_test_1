In Winter Of The World, author Ken Follett takes readers into history’s pages, when the Nazi regime was spreading like a ravenous disease, when the Spaniards were under Franco’s brutality, and when the clash between Japan and the United States led to the dropping of the atomic bomb. The novel follows the stories of five families from Britain, USA, Soviet Union, and Germany, whose lives become linked as result of the second world war and its aftermath.

Against such a colourful background, Follett introduces many characters whose lives and experiences are illuminated by some of the most cataclysmic events of the century. For instance, Carla is one of the protagonists in Follett’s story. Born to English and German parents, her family life is thrown into turmoil as the tide of Nazism sweeps through the nation. Soon afterwards, American brothers Chuck and Woody Dewar enter the picture. Both men pursue different life paths, where one ends up in Washington and the other in the jungles of the Pacific.

Lloyd Williams is another protagonist in Follett’s trilogy. He is caught in the midst of a civil unrest in Spain, fighting both Fascism and Communism. Then, the author introduces readers to two more characters, Daisy Peshkov and her cousin, Volodya. The former is a socialite whose life is transformed by the war, while the latter takes up a prominent position in the Soviet intelligence. Through the dramatic events that unfold, readers are propelled through an action-packed plot, which inextricably reveals the connection between each character.

Indian civilization is among the oldest in the world, and what is unique in that respect is that the culture of the peoples still remains largely unchanged, with a strong thread of continuity through the ages.


The Wonder That was India takes a look at the country’s history from the time of the Harappan or Indus Valley Civilization. It explores the possible causes for the decline of the Harappan civilization and settlements. The book talks about the possibility of the Harappans having moved towards the south and settled in the peninsular region.


The author also discusses the Aryan invasion theory, supporting it with various research papers and findings of that time. The evolution of Hindu religion is also talked about in this book—from the Harappan times, to the coming of the Aryans and the mutual influence that Hinduism and its off shoots Jainism and Buddhism had on each other.


This book is comprehensive in its coverage of Indian history. It looks at every aspect of Indian society and culture. The Wonder That was India covers everything from religion, governance, social evolution, literary traditions, philosophy languages, and science.


The author explores the significant role the Hindu religion played on the lives of the people. All the literary compositions of ancient times had religious associations. He also puts forward the theory that the European gypsies are of Indian origin.


The Wonder That Was India also gives an insight into modern Indian society and culture, how it became a confluence of different influences from many a quarter throughout the many stages of its history.

There is then the treasure of Malik Kafur, whose whereabouts are only known to an old woman. She is kidnapped by Baig and her grandson Dattatreya, seeks the help of the Emperor himself to stop Baig in his evil endeavours. This is the crux of the plot.
As usual, the plot is racy and you can finish the book in less than two hours, if read in a single sitting.

The Palace Of Illusions is a modern retelling of the epic Mahabharata, through the eyes of Panchaali (Draupadi), the wife of the famous Pandava brothers. Divakaruni has rewritten this epic from a female perspective. The focus of the story has shifted from the original war and honour, to more humanistic concerns. It is an epic saga, surrounding the events of Panchali’s life, while growing up in a male dominated world. The Mahabharata is a narrative about the Kurukshetra war between two families, the Pandavas and the Kauravas.

Panchali is the protagonist of Divakaruni's story. She is a young girl born out of a special fire ritual that was performed by her father, King Drupada. Right from the start, she leads a lonely and unusual life, without the care of a mother. Her sole companion is her brother, Dhristadhyumna, who was also born out of fire. Panchaali is characterized as an atypical female as she is a woman who is outspoken, self confident, and defiant. She is also interested in the art of warfare and the politics of monarchy.

Her life changes when she falls in love and ends up married to all the five Pandava brothers. As a result of unfortunate circumstances, she ends up living as a servant, and watches her family suffer through a terrible turn of events. The story explores different areas of Panchaali’s life, such as her husbands’ fight to regain their kingdom, and her intriguing friendship with Lord Krishna. Things become more complicated when she is attracted to Karna, a fierce and noble warrior, who is also the Pandavas’ enemy.

The Palace Of Illusions is a woman’s struggle for survival in a man’s world. This book was published in 2009 by Pan Macmillan India.

'The master storyteller Ken Follett knits together British, American, German and Russian points of view from the start to the end of the First World War into a fascinating and remarkably fertile tapestry of society and politics'

“This is hi-octane storytelling all the more powerful because the story it tells is, mostly, true. Follett's command of the vast forces he unleashes is as impressive as the battle strategies of his generals, and in many cases more so ... overall Follett is masterly in conveying so much drama and historical information so vividly'

During the author’s stay in India, he had researched the story of Mukarram Jah, Hyderabad’s last Nizam and the heir to the throne. He moved to the Australian outback, and began running a sheep station after moving out of his palace. The author decided to explore this link between Australia and India, while he juggled moving between Delhi and Hyderabad.

The Last Nizam: The Rise And Fall Of India’s Greatest Princely State describes the history of one among the many opulent royal dynasties in India. It narrates the saga of an incredible dynasty, the Nizams of Hyderabad. The factors that led to the heir of this remarkable kingdom to leave it all behind and head to the grimy pastures of a remote place in Australia are listed in the book.

The ascent of the Nizams to gain incredible wealth and the significance of this period is described in detail in The Last Nizam: The Rise And Fall Of India’s Greatest Princely State. The story of their prosperous rule under the Indian Mughal emperors is described vividly. It gives a vibrant picture about the realm that was soaked with the blood from a large number of wars and conspiracies.

Written by John Zubrzycki, The Last Nizam: The Rise And Fall Of India’s Greatest Princely State describes Mukarram Jah’s life, which was comical, and at times tragic as well. He has been called His Exalted Highness, the Aristotle of the Times, Asaf Jah VIII, the Regulator of the Realm, the Victor in Battles, the Rustam of the Age, Nawab Mir Barakat Ali Khan Bahadur, the Last Nizam, and many other names. The book also talks about other Nizams like Osman Ali Khan, the Seventh Nizam of Hyderabad.

The author tells the tale of the last Nizam who left the Golconda diamonds and Hyderabad palaces behind, to lead a simple life in the outbacks of Australia. This book is a detailed work and contributes to Indian history. It exuberantly captures the fragrance of wine, wealth and women, which perpetually kept the royals in the news.

It is as real as the violence that has torn the land apart, leaving its people grappling for a semblance of normalcy, if nothing else. The north-east isn't just a hotbed for insurgency and deadly casual encounters, a stopover on every international rock band's schedule, or where used syringes lie waiting in dark alleys. There are other realities as well—of forbidden love, weddings, fascinating cuisines, childhood memories and other `unimportant stories' that never made it to our newspapers and television screens.

In spite of gaining exclusive access to the region, former NDTV Resident Editor (north-east) Kishalay Bhattacharjee has struggled to broadcast stories of these multitudes. Years in the media have taught him that not all revolutions will be televised. Che in Paona Bazaar finds Bhattacharjee deep in the heart of Manipur, demystifying  a state that was once just a source of 'news' for him. These tales are the result of a long and unflinching look into Manipur's past and present, a land rich in tradition, culture and violence, and of a people who stage their own daily rebellion by living and thriving against all odds.

""Intensely poetic, richly imagined, Ira Singh's landscapes are dream-filled and haunting. Her language maps the heart."" -Janice Pariat, Author of Boats on Land

August 1947. Ravinder joins the Survey of India, about to devote his life to mapmaking, traversing unchartered territories, braving the elements. Alone in his tent he devours books by the light of a lamp. He militates against a tyrannical father and a faith he cannot be true to.

In 1958 he falls in love with Jennifer, an Anglo-Indian, the daughter of Grace Robbins - a woman who will never accept this marriage. But marry they do. They have two daughters, Anushka and Natasha.

Natasha is the chronicler of this family of outsiders, peering from the wings as her older sister takes centre stage. Hers is a journey from the small town to the city.

Natasha's father passes on to her his fierce love of the written word and a curiosity about cartography. She traces, as he did, the histories of those relatively unknown surveyors who mapped the country, putting their lives at risk. She also, in the process, traces his life.

The Surveyor, wistful and elegiac, spans several decades and is about the search for identity; about solitude, longing and the price we pay for freedom.",The Surveyor,Ira Singh, , ,PanMcmillan,9789382616276,"1st edition,2014",288,India,English

In Winter Of The World, author Ken Follett takes readers into history’s pages, when the Nazi regime was spreading like a ravenous disease, when the Spaniards were under Franco’s brutality, and when the clash between Japan and the United States led to the dropping of the atomic bomb. The novel follows the stories of five families from Britain, USA, Soviet Union, and Germany, whose lives become linked as result of the second world war and its aftermath.

Against such a colourful background, Follett introduces many characters whose lives and experiences are illuminated by some of the most cataclysmic events of the century. For instance, Carla is one of the protagonists in Follett’s story. Born to English and German parents, her family life is thrown into turmoil as the tide of Nazism sweeps through the nation. Soon afterwards, American brothers Chuck and Woody Dewar enter the picture. Both men pursue different life paths, where one ends up in Washington and the other in the jungles of the Pacific.

Lloyd Williams is another protagonist in Follett’s trilogy. He is caught in the midst of a civil unrest in Spain, fighting both Fascism and Communism. Then, the author introduces readers to two more characters, Daisy Peshkov and her cousin, Volodya. The former is a socialite whose life is transformed by the war, while the latter takes up a prominent position in the Soviet intelligence. Through the dramatic events that unfold, readers are propelled through an action-packed plot, which inextricably reveals the connection between each character.

Indian civilization is among the oldest in the world, and what is unique in that respect is that the culture of the peoples still remains largely unchanged, with a strong thread of continuity through the ages.


The Wonder That was India takes a look at the country’s history from the time of the Harappan or Indus Valley Civilization. It explores the possible causes for the decline of the Harappan civilization and settlements. The book talks about the possibility of the Harappans having moved towards the south and settled in the peninsular region.


The author also discusses the Aryan invasion theory, supporting it with various research papers and findings of that time. The evolution of Hindu religion is also talked about in this book—from the Harappan times, to the coming of the Aryans and the mutual influence that Hinduism and its off shoots Jainism and Buddhism had on each other.


This book is comprehensive in its coverage of Indian history. It looks at every aspect of Indian society and culture. The Wonder That was India covers everything from religion, governance, social evolution, literary traditions, philosophy languages, and science.


The author explores the significant role the Hindu religion played on the lives of the people. All the literary compositions of ancient times had religious associations. He also puts forward the theory that the European gypsies are of Indian origin.


The Wonder That Was India also gives an insight into modern Indian society and culture, how it became a confluence of different influences from many a quarter throughout the many stages of its history.

The Palace Of Illusions is a modern retelling of the epic Mahabharata, through the eyes of Panchaali (Draupadi), the wife of the famous Pandava brothers. Divakaruni has rewritten this epic from a female perspective. The focus of the story has shifted from the original war and honour, to more humanistic concerns. It is an epic saga, surrounding the events of Panchali’s life, while growing up in a male dominated world. The Mahabharata is a narrative about the Kurukshetra war between two families, the Pandavas and the Kauravas.

Panchali is the protagonist of Divakaruni's story. She is a young girl born out of a special fire ritual that was performed by her father, King Drupada. Right from the start, she leads a lonely and unusual life, without the care of a mother. Her sole companion is her brother, Dhristadhyumna, who was also born out of fire. Panchaali is characterized as an atypical female as she is a woman who is outspoken, self confident, and defiant. She is also interested in the art of warfare and the politics of monarchy.

Her life changes when she falls in love and ends up married to all the five Pandava brothers. As a result of unfortunate circumstances, she ends up living as a servant, and watches her family suffer through a terrible turn of events. The story explores different areas of Panchaali’s life, such as her husbands’ fight to regain their kingdom, and her intriguing friendship with Lord Krishna. Things become more complicated when she is attracted to Karna, a fierce and noble warrior, who is also the Pandavas’ enemy.

The Palace Of Illusions is a woman’s struggle for survival in a man’s world. This book was published in 2009 by Pan Macmillan India.

Ken Follett was twenty-seven when he wrote Eye of the Needle, an award-winning thriller that became an international bestseller.

Fall of Giants, the first bestselling book in the Century trilogy is followed by this, Winter of the World.

Praise for the Century trilogy

'The master storyteller Ken Follett knits together British, American, German and Russian points of view from the start to the end of the First World War into a fascinating and remarkably fertile tapestry of society and politics'
The Times

“This is hi-octane storytelling all the more powerful because the story it tells is, mostly, true. Follett's command of the vast forces he unleashes is as impressive as the battle strategies of his generals, and in many cases more so ... overall Follett is masterly in conveying so much drama and historical information so vividly'
Scotsman

‘Follett trilogy's big start will have fans yearning for more ... A powerful drama that rattles along at top speed. It's pacy, absorbing and packed with historical detail

During the author’s stay in India, he had researched the story of Mukarram Jah, Hyderabad’s last Nizam and the heir to the throne. He moved to the Australian outback, and began running a sheep station after moving out of his palace. The author decided to explore this link between Australia and India, while he juggled moving between Delhi and Hyderabad.

The Last Nizam: The Rise And Fall Of India’s Greatest Princely State describes the history of one among the many opulent royal dynasties in India. It narrates the saga of an incredible dynasty, the Nizams of Hyderabad. The factors that led to the heir of this remarkable kingdom to leave it all behind and head to the grimy pastures of a remote place in Australia are listed in the book.

The ascent of the Nizams to gain incredible wealth and the significance of this period is described in detail in The Last Nizam: The Rise And Fall Of India’s Greatest Princely State. The story of their prosperous rule under the Indian Mughal emperors is described vividly. It gives a vibrant picture about the realm that was soaked with the blood from a large number of wars and conspiracies.

Written by John Zubrzycki, The Last Nizam: The Rise And Fall Of India’s Greatest Princely State describes Mukarram Jah’s life, which was comical, and at times tragic as well. He has been called His Exalted Highness, the Aristotle of the Times, Asaf Jah VIII, the Regulator of the Realm, the Victor in Battles, the Rustam of the Age, Nawab Mir Barakat Ali Khan Bahadur, the Last Nizam, and many other names. The book also talks about other Nizams like Osman Ali Khan, the Seventh Nizam of Hyderabad.

The author tells the tale of the last Nizam who left the Golconda diamonds and Hyderabad palaces behind, to lead a simple life in the outbacks of Australia. This book is a detailed work and contributes to Indian history. It exuberantly captures the fragrance of wine, wealth and women, which perpetually kept the royals in the news.

There are other realities as well—of forbidden love, weddings, fascinating cuisines, childhood memories and other `unimportant stories' that never made it to our newspapers and television screens.

Years in the media have taught him that not all revolutions will be televised. Che in Paona Bazaar finds Bhattacharjee deep in the heart of Manipur, demystifying  a state that was once just a source of 'news' for him. These tales are the result of a long and unflinching look into Manipur's past and present, a land rich in tradition, culture and violence, and of a people who stage their own daily rebellion by living and thriving against all odds.

August 1947. Ravinder joins the Survey of India, about to devote his life to mapmaking, traversing unchartered territories, braving the elements. Alone in his tent he devours books by the light of a lamp. He militates against a tyrannical father and a faith he cannot be true to.

In 1958 he falls in love with Jennifer, an Anglo-Indian, the daughter of Grace Robbins - a woman who will never accept this marriage. But marry they do. They have two daughters, Anushka and Natasha.

Natasha is the chronicler of this family of outsiders, peering from the wings as her older sister takes centre stage. Hers is a journey from the small town to the city.

Natasha's father passes on to her his fierce love of the written word and a curiosity about cartography. She traces, as he did, the histories of those relatively unknown surveyors who mapped the country, putting their lives at risk. She also, in the process, traces his life.

The principal personalities, events and turning points of the pre-1990 and post-1990 eras come to life in the pages of Transforming India.
The vitality of Indian democracy derives from the enthusiastic participation of hundreds of millions of ordinary Indians the demos. But its transformation into a polity of by and for the people awaits solutions to great problems of poverty, inequality and alienation.
