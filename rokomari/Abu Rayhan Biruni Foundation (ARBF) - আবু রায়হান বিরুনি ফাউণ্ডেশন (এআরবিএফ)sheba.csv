Influence of Persian Literature on Shah Muhammad Sagir's Yusuf Zulaikha and Alaol's Padmavati ,ড. আবু মুসা মোহাম্মদ আরিফ বিল্লাহ,"",TK. 750,https://rokomari.com//book/93886/influence-of-persian-literature-on-shah-muhammad-sagir-s-yusuf-zulaikha-and-alaol-s-padmavati,"Influence of Persian Literature on Shah Muhammad Sagir’s Yusuf Zulaikhā and Alaol’s Padmāvatī is a PhD research Monograph by Dr. Abu Musa Mohammad Arif Billah at School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London. The book discusses and analyses as well as depicts many issues with a reflection on: 
a)	The historical background of Iran and Indo-Bangla Relations; Cultural and Literary Models – evolved with Buddhism and Hinduism and its integration during the early Muslim period. Development of Persian literary and Sufi traditions in Bengal and its impact on local vernacular language, literature and culture. Development of Bengali language and literature and a critical analysis of the controversy over ‘The Dark Age’ of Bengali language and literature. 
b)	It investigates how the story of Joseph in the Bible and of Yusuf in the Quran was transformed into a romantic love story Yūsuf va Zulaikhā by Persian poets, and how Sagir transformed it into Bengali with a local flavour. It also addresses how Perso-Arabic literary and Sufi tradition, especially the Yūsuf va Zulaikhā of Firdawsi, the tradition of commentaries on the Quran (Tafsīr) and tales of the prophets (Qiṣaṣ), influenced Sagir’s poetic thoughts.
c)	Regarding Alaol’s Padmāvatī, after looking at the process of development of the story by analysing ancient and medieval local and foreign elements such as drama, fables, Sufi love poems and mythology, it assesses how Alaol transformed Malik Muhammad Jayasi’s Hindi poem Padmāvatī into Bengali. It examines how Perso-Arabic literary and Sufi themes, especially fāna, annihilation, and bāqa, subsistence, in Attar’s Manṭiqu’ṭ- Ṭair, influenced Jayasi in writing the Hindi poem Padmāvatī and Alaol in transforming it into Bengali.
