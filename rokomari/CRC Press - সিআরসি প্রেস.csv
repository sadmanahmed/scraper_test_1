First published in 1919 as 'Diseases of Women', Gynaecology by Ten Teachers is well established as a concise, yet comprehensive, guide within its field. The twentieth edition has been thoroughly updated by a new team of 'teachers', integrating clinical material with the latest scientific developments that underpin patient care. Each chapter is highly structured, with learning objectives, definitions, aetiology, clinical features, investigations, treatments, case histories and key point summaries and additional reading where appropriate. New themes for this edition include 'professionalism' and 'global health' and information specific to both areas is threaded throughout the text. Along with its companion Obstetrics by Ten Teachers, the books will continue to provide an accessible 'one stop shop' in obstetrics and gynaecology for a new generation of doctors.

The format facilitates the teaching of the case approach for diagnostic ultrastructural pathology using clinical-ultrastructural-pathologic correlation. These guides illustrate key reasoning processes that physicians use to resolve individual clinical problems through the use of electron microscopy. The material is useful to a wide variety of physicians and students of medicine, structure, and disease at various levels of training, as well as in the training of and operational use by technical support staff.The two volumes include a total of 50 cases and a procedural guide for the ultrastructural pathology laboratory. The cases were selected using four principal criteria: (1) classic cases, which are diagnosed readily by light microscopy to facilitate the electron microscopic diagnosis of less classic cases; (2) diagnostic cases, for which ultrastructural analysis is essential for diagnosis; (3) supportive cases, where either the light or the electron microscopic diagnosis is supportive, and thus confirmatory, of the other; and (4) new facts cases, which establish new knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of disease using electron microscopy as the investigative modality. The 50 cases are grouped anatomically in four major categories. Volume II contains the sections on the respiratory and nervous systems, and Volume III presents the cases dealing with the endocrine and hematopoietic systems. Each section is preceded by introductory remarks. Each case cites relevant, classic, anatomic pathology papers and related research papers. These volumes also include multiple functional indices, providing ready access to the material from several starting points. There are separate indices for presenting symptoms, differential diagnostic groups, ultrastructural pathology criteria, and final diagnostic categories. As a valuable resource and guide, Diagnostic Ultrastructural Pathology, Volumes II and III, is an excellent, high-quality addition to the field of diagnostic pathology.",Diagnostic Ultrastructural Pathology -Vol-2,"Ann M.

First published in 1919 as 'Diseases of Women', Gynaecology by Ten Teachers is well established as a concise, yet comprehensive, guide within its field. The twentieth edition has been thoroughly updated by a new team of 'teachers', integrating clinical material with the latest scientific developments that underpin patient care. Each chapter is highly structured, with learning objectives, definitions, aetiology, clinical features, investigations, treatments, case histories and key point summaries and additional reading where appropriate. New themes for this edition include 'professionalism' and 'global health' and information specific to both areas is threaded throughout the text. Along with its companion Obstetrics by Ten Teachers, the books will continue to provide an accessible 'one stop shop' in obstetrics and gynaecology for a new generation of doctors.

The format facilitates the teaching of the case approach for diagnostic ultrastructural pathology using clinical-ultrastructural-pathologic correlation. These guides illustrate key reasoning processes that physicians use to resolve individual clinical problems through the use of electron microscopy. The material is useful to a wide variety of physicians and students of medicine, structure, and disease at various levels of training, as well as in the training of and operational use by technical support staff.The two volumes include a total of 50 cases and a procedural guide for the ultrastructural pathology laboratory. The cases were selected using four principal criteria: (1) classic cases, which are diagnosed readily by light microscopy to facilitate the electron microscopic diagnosis of less classic cases; (2) diagnostic cases, for which ultrastructural analysis is essential for diagnosis; (3) supportive cases, where either the light or the electron microscopic diagnosis is supportive, and thus confirmatory, of the other; and (4) new facts cases, which establish new knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of disease using electron microscopy as the investigative modality. The 50 cases are grouped anatomically in four major categories. Volume II contains the sections on the respiratory and nervous systems, and Volume III presents the cases dealing with the endocrine and hematopoietic systems. Each section is preceded by introductory remarks. Each case cites relevant, classic, anatomic pathology papers and related research papers. These volumes also include multiple functional indices, providing ready access to the material from several starting points. There are separate indices for presenting symptoms, differential diagnostic groups, ultrastructural pathology criteria, and final diagnostic categories. As a valuable resource and guide, Diagnostic Ultrastructural Pathology, Volumes II and III, is an excellent, high-quality addition to the field of diagnostic pathology.",Diagnostic Ultrastructural Pathology -Vol-2,"Ann M.

Each chapter is highly structured, with learning objectives, definitions, aetiology, clinical features, investigations, treatments, case histories and key point summaries and additional reading where appropriate. New themes for this edition include 'professionalism' and 'global health' and information specific to both areas is threaded throughout the text. Along with its companion Obstetrics by Ten Teachers, the books will continue to provide an accessible 'one stop shop' in obstetrics and gynaecology for a new generation of doctors.

The format facilitates the teaching of the case approach for diagnostic ultrastructural pathology using clinical-ultrastructural-pathologic correlation. These guides illustrate key reasoning processes that physicians use to resolve individual clinical problems through the use of electron microscopy. The material is useful to a wide variety of physicians and students of medicine, structure, and disease at various levels of training, as well as in the training of and operational use by technical support staff.The two volumes include a total of 50 cases and a procedural guide for the ultrastructural pathology laboratory. The cases were selected using four principal criteria: (1) classic cases, which are diagnosed readily by light microscopy to facilitate the electron microscopic diagnosis of less classic cases; (2) diagnostic cases, for which ultrastructural analysis is essential for diagnosis; (3) supportive cases, where either the light or the electron microscopic diagnosis is supportive, and thus confirmatory, of the other; and (4) new facts cases, which establish new knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of disease using electron microscopy as the investigative modality. The 50 cases are grouped anatomically in four major categories. Volume II contains the sections on the respiratory and nervous systems, and Volume III presents the cases dealing with the endocrine and hematopoietic systems. Each section is preceded by introductory remarks. Each case cites relevant, classic, anatomic pathology papers and related research papers. These volumes also include multiple functional indices, providing ready access to the material from several starting points. There are separate indices for presenting symptoms, differential diagnostic groups, ultrastructural pathology criteria, and final diagnostic categories. As a valuable resource and guide, Diagnostic Ultrastructural Pathology, Volumes II and III, is an excellent, high-quality addition to the field of diagnostic pathology.",Diagnostic Ultrastructural Pathology -Vol-2,"Ann M.
