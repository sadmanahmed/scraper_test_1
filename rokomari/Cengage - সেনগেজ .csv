Production and Operations Management focuses on the concepts essential to a simple-quantitative understanding of strategies and tactics in the P/OM field. Using a managerial focus with the systems approach, this book clarifies the field of Production and Operations Management in its current state. The systems approach is ideal for the managerial focus because the systems approach crosses functional boundaries in search of best solutions. This line of attack has come into strong favor by industry managers. In lieu of detailed quantitative discussions, Starr has streamlined, clarified, and updated fundamental qualitative concepts of business and P/OM. This introductory text provides students with a solid managerial framework for making better decisions, developing career skills, and problem-solving to support company sustainability. The writing style encourages educational literacy.

Key Feature
•	Spotlights open and close each chapter, highlighting reasons for success or failure, ethical issues, and examples of leadership.
•	The organization and layout is simple and appealing to students with the intent of making learning about P/OM fun instead of being a formidable challenge.

Today's increased use of digital sound and video makes data compression crucial to computer technology because of its vast storage and transmission requirements. The question in many applications is now not whether to compress data, but what compression method should be applied. Most data compression books have been written for professionals and require a strong background in data compression techniques as well as an understanding of algorithms based on sophisticated mathematical models.

This book is one of a handful of textbooks to present Data Compression for students in an academic environment. This is not a simple task since most of the widely used algorithms rely on sophisticated mathematical models. Elements of Data Compression addresses the needs of students who will use these techniques on a daily basis. The author accomplishes this through the use of elementary-level representative methods of text, audio, and video compression. Drozdek presents these methods with pseudocode, tables, diagrams, and many worked out examples, all the while employing commonly used techniques that build upon the mathematics students have been exposed to in earlier courses. 

Key Features

•	The book provides the necessary theoretical foundations for data compression methods. This includes basic concepts of information theory, problems of sampling and quantization, transforms, and filters
•	Where students are likely to need assistance, the author provides extensive auxiliary material on mathematical topics. This material includes some basic facts about matrices, probability distributions, and Fourier analysis
•	The book concentrates on different techniques and algorithms used for data compression today, including a discussion of when these methods should be implemented
•	The algorithms presented in the book are discussed in depth and illustrated with extended worked out examples
•	The book concentrates on the most widely used, preexisting algorithms. Instructors can easily encourage students to implement their variations of the algorithms
•	This material requires the students to have completed a discrete math and a calculus course.

Production and Operations Management focuses on the concepts essential to a simple-quantitative understanding of strategies and tactics in the P/OM field. Using a managerial focus with the systems approach, this book clarifies the field of Production and Operations Management in its current state. The systems approach is ideal for the managerial focus because the systems approach crosses functional boundaries in search of best solutions. This line of attack has come into strong favor by industry managers. In lieu of detailed quantitative discussions, Starr has streamlined, clarified, and updated fundamental qualitative concepts of business and P/OM. This introductory text provides students with a solid managerial framework for making better decisions, developing career skills, and problem-solving to support company sustainability. The writing style encourages educational literacy.

Key Feature
•	Spotlights open and close each chapter, highlighting reasons for success or failure, ethical issues, and examples of leadership.
•	The organization and layout is simple and appealing to students with the intent of making learning about P/OM fun instead of being a formidable challenge.

Today's increased use of digital sound and video makes data compression crucial to computer technology because of its vast storage and transmission requirements. The question in many applications is now not whether to compress data, but what compression method should be applied. Most data compression books have been written for professionals and require a strong background in data compression techniques as well as an understanding of algorithms based on sophisticated mathematical models.

This book is one of a handful of textbooks to present Data Compression for students in an academic environment. This is not a simple task since most of the widely used algorithms rely on sophisticated mathematical models. Elements of Data Compression addresses the needs of students who will use these techniques on a daily basis. The author accomplishes this through the use of elementary-level representative methods of text, audio, and video compression. Drozdek presents these methods with pseudocode, tables, diagrams, and many worked out examples, all the while employing commonly used techniques that build upon the mathematics students have been exposed to in earlier courses. 

Key Features

•	The book provides the necessary theoretical foundations for data compression methods. This includes basic concepts of information theory, problems of sampling and quantization, transforms, and filters
•	Where students are likely to need assistance, the author provides extensive auxiliary material on mathematical topics. This material includes some basic facts about matrices, probability distributions, and Fourier analysis
•	The book concentrates on different techniques and algorithms used for data compression today, including a discussion of when these methods should be implemented
•	The algorithms presented in the book are discussed in depth and illustrated with extended worked out examples
•	The book concentrates on the most widely used, preexisting algorithms. Instructors can easily encourage students to implement their variations of the algorithms
•	This material requires the students to have completed a discrete math and a calculus course.

Production and Operations Management focuses on the concepts essential to a simple-quantitative understanding of strategies and tactics in the P/OM field. Using a managerial focus with the systems approach, this book clarifies the field of Production and Operations Management in its current state. The systems approach is ideal for the managerial focus because the systems approach crosses functional boundaries in search of best solutions. This line of attack has come into strong favor by industry managers. In lieu of detailed quantitative discussions, Starr has streamlined, clarified, and updated fundamental qualitative concepts of business and P/OM. This introductory text provides students with a solid managerial framework for making better decisions, developing career skills, and problem-solving to support company sustainability. The writing style encourages educational literacy.

Key Feature
•	Spotlights open and close each chapter, highlighting reasons for success or failure, ethical issues, and examples of leadership.
•	The organization and layout is simple and appealing to students with the intent of making learning about P/OM fun instead of being a formidable challenge.

Today's increased use of digital sound and video makes data compression crucial to computer technology because of its vast storage and transmission requirements. The question in many applications is now not whether to compress data, but what compression method should be applied. Most data compression books have been written for professionals and require a strong background in data compression techniques as well as an understanding of algorithms based on sophisticated mathematical models.

This book is one of a handful of textbooks to present Data Compression for students in an academic environment. This is not a simple task since most of the widely used algorithms rely on sophisticated mathematical models. Elements of Data Compression addresses the needs of students who will use these techniques on a daily basis. The author accomplishes this through the use of elementary-level representative methods of text, audio, and video compression. Drozdek presents these methods with pseudocode, tables, diagrams, and many worked out examples, all the while employing commonly used techniques that build upon the mathematics students have been exposed to in earlier courses. 

Key Features

•	The book provides the necessary theoretical foundations for data compression methods. This includes basic concepts of information theory, problems of sampling and quantization, transforms, and filters
•	Where students are likely to need assistance, the author provides extensive auxiliary material on mathematical topics. This material includes some basic facts about matrices, probability distributions, and Fourier analysis
•	The book concentrates on different techniques and algorithms used for data compression today, including a discussion of when these methods should be implemented
•	The algorithms presented in the book are discussed in depth and illustrated with extended worked out examples
•	The book concentrates on the most widely used, preexisting algorithms. Instructors can easily encourage students to implement their variations of the algorithms
•	This material requires the students to have completed a discrete math and a calculus course.

Production and Operations Management focuses on the concepts essential to a simple-quantitative understanding of strategies and tactics in the P/OM field. Using a managerial focus with the systems approach, this book clarifies the field of Production and Operations Management in its current state. The systems approach is ideal for the managerial focus because the systems approach crosses functional boundaries in search of best solutions. This line of attack has come into strong favor by industry managers. In lieu of detailed quantitative discussions, Starr has streamlined, clarified, and updated fundamental qualitative concepts of business and P/OM. This introductory text provides students with a solid managerial framework for making better decisions, developing career skills, and problem-solving to support company sustainability. The writing style encourages educational literacy.

Key Feature
•	Spotlights open and close each chapter, highlighting reasons for success or failure, ethical issues, and examples of leadership.
•	The organization and layout is simple and appealing to students with the intent of making learning about P/OM fun instead of being a formidable challenge.

This text is well-known for using the Keynesian model in the teaching of economics; yet, in recent editions, the authors expanded coverage of the growth model considerably to achieve more balanced coverage. The text uses the aggregate supply/aggregate demand model as a fundamental tool for learning macroeconomics. It achieves the right level of rigor and detail, presenting complicated concepts in a relatively straightforward manner and using timely economic data. Using puzzles, issues, and well-developed examples, the authors provide a good balance of theory to application, allowing you to relate the materials to your everyday life.

Key Feature
•	There is expanded coverage on developing economies (China and India), as well as coverage on outsourcing
•	The book provides analysis of human capital's impact on economic growth, including a discussion on minimum wage and household protection
•	More developed discussion of consumer choice has been added, including expanded coverage on budget limitations and constraints when discussing consumer theory
•	The authors include new material on banking, energy and the history of economics, as well as new analysis of the mortgage crisis of 2007

Today's increased use of digital sound and video makes data compression crucial to computer technology because of its vast storage and transmission requirements. The question in many applications is now not whether to compress data, but what compression method should be applied. Most data compression books have been written for professionals and require a strong background in data compression techniques as well as an understanding of algorithms based on sophisticated mathematical models.

This book is one of a handful of textbooks to present Data Compression for students in an academic environment. This is not a simple task since most of the widely used algorithms rely on sophisticated mathematical models. Elements of Data Compression addresses the needs of students who will use these techniques on a daily basis. The author accomplishes this through the use of elementary-level representative methods of text, audio, and video compression. Drozdek presents these methods with pseudocode, tables, diagrams, and many worked out examples, all the while employing commonly used techniques that build upon the mathematics students have been exposed to in earlier courses. 

Key Features

•	The book provides the necessary theoretical foundations for data compression methods. This includes basic concepts of information theory, problems of sampling and quantization, transforms, and filters
•	Where students are likely to need assistance, the author provides extensive auxiliary material on mathematical topics. This material includes some basic facts about matrices, probability distributions, and Fourier analysis
•	The book concentrates on different techniques and algorithms used for data compression today, including a discussion of when these methods should be implemented
•	The algorithms presented in the book are discussed in depth and illustrated with extended worked out examples
•	The book concentrates on the most widely used, preexisting algorithms. Instructors can easily encourage students to implement their variations of the algorithms
•	This material requires the students to have completed a discrete math and a calculus course.
