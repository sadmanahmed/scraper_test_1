In this now famous book, he points out the thirteen mistakes that every leader should avoid that are now as well known in Armies across the world as are the Ten Commandments.
S.L.A. Marshall has looked at the arena of battle closely and analysed situations and circumstances that question and test human psychology. His suggestions are thus all encompassing, focusing on the minute as well as the larger picture.
While there are several books that focus on war realities and decisions taken under pressure, this book lays emphasis on the psychological competence that is required of an officer to lead in times of war.
A classic, this book continues to hold place of pride on the military bookshelf.",The Officer As A Leader,S L A Marshall, , ,Natraj Publishers,9788181580436,"12nd Edition,2005",288,India,English
