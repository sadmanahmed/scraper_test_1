The question of whether sequencing can have a negative effect on nutritional value in central in this respect. Although relatively little direct research in this area has been done, there are scientific indications that, by favoring certain aspects of a plant's development, other aspects may be retarded. The emphasis may shift from gene mapping and genome analysis to the analysis of gene function and regulation, determination of genetic disease and somatic gene therapy. The development of novel data handling technologies may also be pursued. The opportunities for various genome projects have been discussed on the basis of advances in DNA sequencing technologies.
