Mario Hits the Mushroom Kingdom Jackpot
Bowser has once again kidnapped Princess Peach, but besides rescuing his lady love, this time Mario has another objective. The Mushroom Kingdom is bursting with more gold coins than ever before. Each level is littered with gold as coins rain down from overhead pipes, trails of coins are left behind special gold enemies and gold pipes transport Mario into coin-filled caverns. It's up to players to collect as many coins as possible throughout their adventure. 
Enjoy the Platforming Fun With a Friend
New Super Mario Bros. 2 allows players to share the fast-paced fun with a friend over a local wireless network. The game's 2-player co-op mode requires both players to have a Nintendo 3DS system and a copy of the game. Together players can play through the entire game, collect double the coins, team up to unleash devastating double Ground Pound attacks on enemies, and more. An extra player can even help when continuing from your solo play save file. 
Collect, Literally a Million Coins
Coin collection is important in every adventure in the Mushroom Kingdom, but New Super Mario Bros. 2 takes this to new heights. The game is filled with more coins and gold-related features than any Mario game before, and includes the frenzied Coin Rush mode in which you play three levels back to back trying to earn as many coins as possible. In fact, the game literally holds more than a million possible coins, and keeps track of each for you as you proceed from beginning to end. SpotPass functionality built into the 3DS allows you to share your running total with friends. If you reach a million coins, you'll get something special. 
Key Game Features
•	New Super Mario Bros. 2 is an all-new side-scrolling adventure game featuring Mario and Luigi. Two players who each own the game will have the option to play the entire game in two-player multiplayer mode using local wireless.
•	The game records all the coins players collect throughout the game, so completing a level is only part of the fun. Every level is filled with golden opportunities, such as gold rings that turn enemies into valuable gold versions and a Gold Flower that gives Mario the ability to turn almost anything in his path into coins.
•	Coin Rush Mode allows players to collect as many coins as possible across three levels and challenge friends to beat their record via StreetPass.
•	The return of Raccoon Mario gives Mario the ability to fly and access hidden areas.
•	Utilize a wide range of new and returning power-ups and items spread throughout the game world.",New Super Mario Bros. 2 -Nintendo 3DS,Games  World, , ,Games World, , , ,Bangladesh,English

What does the American Dream mean today? 
For Niko Bellic, fresh off the boat from Europe, it is the hope he can escape his past. For his cousin, Roman, it is the vision that together they can find fortune in Liberty City, gateway to the land of opportunity. As they slip into debt and are dragged into a criminal underworld by a series of shysters, thieves and sociopaths, they discover that the reality is very different from the dream in a city that worships money and status, and is heaven for those who have them and a living nightmare for those who don’t.
Beginning with the 1997 release of the original Grand Theft Auto, the GTA series has been one of the most prolific, controversial and down right entertaining franchises in video games history. This pedigree of success guarantees that the highly anticipated eleventh game in the series, Grand Theft Auto IV, will garner at least as much attention if not more.

The Plot
Grand Theft Auto IV is a brand new adventure in the GTA universe following the experiences of Nikolai ""Niko"" Bellic, a new immigrant from an undisclosed eastern European country whose troubled pa st and the persuasion of his cousin Roman have brought him to the fictional Liberty City. Unfortunately, Niko’s search for the American Dream and a much needed fresh start, hits an immediate snag when the rags to riches story Roman spun to pique Niko's interest is exposed as not only a complete fabrication, but a ploy to enlist Niko’s well-known skills as a tough guy against the ample list of enemies clamoring for Roman’s debt-ridden blood.
Because Roman is the only person Niko knows in Liberty City he begrudgingly accepts his role as Roman’s protector despite the deception. But as time goes on Niko comes into his own, and his experience on the wrong side of the tracks proves more valuable than he could have ever imagined as he fights for survival and later supremacy on the crime ridden streets of Liberty City.
Game Environments
Based on several of the boroughs of New York City and parts of New Jersey, Liberty City, familiar to players of previous games in the series, has been entirely redesigned for GTA IV. Players can expect visible detail down to the weeds growing in the cracks in the sidewalk, cars and buildings of visibly different ages and a much greater level if verticality in the buildings and bridges that they are able to explore as Niko moves through the city streets. In addition, pedestrians in GTA IV are much more realistic. No longer simply moving cardboard cutouts, these NPCs are intelligent, modern, human representations that laugh, cry, eat, drink, use cell phones and ATMs, and talking amongst themselves regardless of Niko’s interaction with them.
Gameplay
Historically GTA games have focused heavily on mission-based play, requiring successful completion of fixed tasks in order for players to progress through the game, but this has changed to a great extent in GTA IV. Players will experience an entirely new and exciting emphasis centered on the blending of on-mission and off-mission play, resulting not only in an increased sense of realism, but more interesting and unrestricted gameplay.",Grand Theft Auto V  -Playstation 3,Games  World, , ,Games World, , , ,Bangladesh,English

Mario Hits the Mushroom Kingdom Jackpot
Bowser has once again kidnapped Princess Peach, but besides rescuing his lady love, this time Mario has another objective. The Mushroom Kingdom is bursting with more gold coins than ever before. Each level is littered with gold as coins rain down from overhead pipes, trails of coins are left behind special gold enemies and gold pipes transport Mario into coin-filled caverns. It's up to players to collect as many coins as possible throughout their adventure. 
Enjoy the Platforming Fun With a Friend
New Super Mario Bros. 2 allows players to share the fast-paced fun with a friend over a local wireless network. The game's 2-player co-op mode requires both players to have a Nintendo 3DS system and a copy of the game. Together players can play through the entire game, collect double the coins, team up to unleash devastating double Ground Pound attacks on enemies, and more. An extra player can even help when continuing from your solo play save file. 
Collect, Literally a Million Coins
Coin collection is important in every adventure in the Mushroom Kingdom, but New Super Mario Bros. 2 takes this to new heights. The game is filled with more coins and gold-related features than any Mario game before, and includes the frenzied Coin Rush mode in which you play three levels back to back trying to earn as many coins as possible. In fact, the game literally holds more than a million possible coins, and keeps track of each for you as you proceed from beginning to end. SpotPass functionality built into the 3DS allows you to share your running total with friends. If you reach a million coins, you'll get something special. 
Key Game Features
•	New Super Mario Bros. 2 is an all-new side-scrolling adventure game featuring Mario and Luigi. Two players who each own the game will have the option to play the entire game in two-player multiplayer mode using local wireless.
•	The game records all the coins players collect throughout the game, so completing a level is only part of the fun. Every level is filled with golden opportunities, such as gold rings that turn enemies into valuable gold versions and a Gold Flower that gives Mario the ability to turn almost anything in his path into coins.
•	Coin Rush Mode allows players to collect as many coins as possible across three levels and challenge friends to beat their record via StreetPass.
•	The return of Raccoon Mario gives Mario the ability to fly and access hidden areas.
•	Utilize a wide range of new and returning power-ups and items spread throughout the game world.",New Super Mario Bros. 2 -Nintendo 3DS,Games  World, , ,Games World, , , ,Bangladesh,English

For his cousin, Roman, it is the vision that together they can find fortune in Liberty City, gateway to the land of opportunity. As they slip into debt and are dragged into a criminal underworld by a series of shysters, thieves and sociopaths, they discover that the reality is very different from the dream in a city that worships money and status, and is heaven for those who have them and a living nightmare for those who don't.

What does the American Dream mean today? 
For Niko Bellic, fresh off the boat from Europe, it is the hope he can escape his past. For his cousin, Roman, it is the vision that together they can find fortune in Liberty City, gateway to the land of opportunity. As they slip into debt and are dragged into a criminal underworld by a series of shysters, thieves and sociopaths, they discover that the reality is very different from the dream in a city that worships money and status, and is heaven for those who have them and a living nightmare for those who don’t.
Beginning with the 1997 release of the original Grand Theft Auto, the GTA series has been one of the most prolific, controversial and down right entertaining franchises in video games history. This pedigree of success guarantees that the highly anticipated eleventh game in the series, Grand Theft Auto IV, will garner at least as much attention if not more.

The Plot
Grand Theft Auto IV is a brand new adventure in the GTA universe following the experiences of Nikolai ""Niko"" Bellic, a new immigrant from an undisclosed eastern European country whose troubled pa st and the persuasion of his cousin Roman have brought him to the fictional Liberty City. Unfortunately, Niko’s search for the American Dream and a much needed fresh start, hits an immediate snag when the rags to riches story Roman spun to pique Niko's interest is exposed as not only a complete fabrication, but a ploy to enlist Niko’s well-known skills as a tough guy against the ample list of enemies clamoring for Roman’s debt-ridden blood.
Because Roman is the only person Niko knows in Liberty City he begrudgingly accepts his role as Roman’s protector despite the deception. But as time goes on Niko comes into his own, and his experience on the wrong side of the tracks proves more valuable than he could have ever imagined as he fights for survival and later supremacy on the crime ridden streets of Liberty City.
Game Environments
Based on several of the boroughs of New York City and parts of New Jersey, Liberty City, familiar to players of previous games in the series, has been entirely redesigned for GTA IV. Players can expect visible detail down to the weeds growing in the cracks in the sidewalk, cars and buildings of visibly different ages and a much greater level if verticality in the buildings and bridges that they are able to explore as Niko moves through the city streets. In addition, pedestrians in GTA IV are much more realistic. No longer simply moving cardboard cutouts, these NPCs are intelligent, modern, human representations that laugh, cry, eat, drink, use cell phones and ATMs, and talking amongst themselves regardless of Niko’s interaction with them.
Gameplay
Historically GTA games have focused heavily on mission-based play, requiring successful completion of fixed tasks in order for players to progress through the game, but this has changed to a great extent in GTA IV. Players will experience an entirely new and exciting emphasis centered on the blending of on-mission and off-mission play, resulting not only in an increased sense of realism, but more interesting and unrestricted gameplay.",Grand Theft Auto V  -Playstation 3,Games  World, , ,Games World, , , ,Bangladesh,English

These Syndicates have revolutionized how the consumer interacts with the digital world. No longer does the consumer require a device to access the world’s data and control their technology, they can do this at the blink of an eye via neural chip implant. Civilians flocked to be “chip’d” and enjoy all that their selected Syndicate has to offer; housing, medical, banking, insurance, education, entertainment and jobs. One complete package. One complete lifestyle. In return, the Syndicates gained unprecedented insights, and control, over the individual and their behaviour. With little governmental oversight, business has become war. The Syndicates will stop at nothing for ultimate market dominance. At the front line of this war are the Agents, the Syndicate’s bio-engineered and chip-augmented enforcers. They can breach anything in the wired world including their enemies, their weapons and the environment that surrounds them, making them the most efficient and deadly technological weapons in the world.

Mario Hits the Mushroom Kingdom Jackpot
Bowser has once again kidnapped Princess Peach, but besides rescuing his lady love, this time Mario has another objective. The Mushroom Kingdom is bursting with more gold coins than ever before. Each level is littered with gold as coins rain down from overhead pipes, trails of coins are left behind special gold enemies and gold pipes transport Mario into coin-filled caverns. It's up to players to collect as many coins as possible throughout their adventure. 
Enjoy the Platforming Fun With a Friend
New Super Mario Bros. 2 allows players to share the fast-paced fun with a friend over a local wireless network. The game's 2-player co-op mode requires both players to have a Nintendo 3DS system and a copy of the game. Together players can play through the entire game, collect double the coins, team up to unleash devastating double Ground Pound attacks on enemies, and more. An extra player can even help when continuing from your solo play save file. 
Collect, Literally a Million Coins
Coin collection is important in every adventure in the Mushroom Kingdom, but New Super Mario Bros. 2 takes this to new heights. The game is filled with more coins and gold-related features than any Mario game before, and includes the frenzied Coin Rush mode in which you play three levels back to back trying to earn as many coins as possible. In fact, the game literally holds more than a million possible coins, and keeps track of each for you as you proceed from beginning to end. SpotPass functionality built into the 3DS allows you to share your running total with friends. If you reach a million coins, you'll get something special.

What does the American Dream mean today? 
For Niko Bellic, fresh off the boat from Europe, it is the hope he can escape his past. For his cousin, Roman, it is the vision that together they can find fortune in Liberty City, gateway to the land of opportunity. As they slip into debt and are dragged into a criminal underworld by a series of shysters, thieves and sociopaths, they discover that the reality is very different from the dream in a city that worships money and status, and is heaven for those who have them and a living nightmare for those who don’t.
Beginning with the 1997 release of the original Grand Theft Auto, the GTA series has been one of the most prolific, controversial and down right entertaining franchises in video games history. This pedigree of success guarantees that the highly anticipated eleventh game in the series, Grand Theft Auto IV, will garner at least as much attention if not more.
 
Return to Liberty City.
 
The dream as Niko expected it.

The Plot
Grand Theft Auto IV is a brand new adventure in the GTA universe following the experiences of Nikolai ""Niko"" Bellic, a new immigrant from an undisclosed eastern European country whose troubled pa st and the persuasion of his cousin Roman have brought him to the fictional Liberty City. Unfortunately, Niko’s search for the American Dream and a much needed fresh start, hits an immediate snag when the rags to riches story Roman spun to pique Niko's interest is exposed as not only a complete fabrication, but a ploy to enlist Niko’s well-known skills as a tough guy against the ample list of enemies clamoring for Roman’s debt-ridden blood.
Because Roman is the only person Niko knows in Liberty City he begrudgingly accepts his role as Roman’s protector despite the deception. But as time goes on Niko comes into his own, and his experience on the wrong side of the tracks proves more valuable than he could have ever imagined as he fights for survival and later supremacy on the crime ridden streets of Liberty City.
Game Environments
Based on several of the boroughs of New York City and parts of New Jersey, Liberty City, familiar to players of previous games in the series, has been entirely redesigned for GTA IV. Players can expect visible detail down to the weeds growing in the cracks in the sidewalk, cars and buildings of visibly different ages and a much greater level if verticality in the buildings and bridges that they are able to explore as Niko moves through the city streets. In addition, pedestrians in GTA IV are much more realistic. No longer simply moving cardboard cutouts, these NPCs are intelligent, modern, human representations that laugh, cry, eat, drink, use cell phones and ATMs, and talking amongst themselves regardless of Niko’s interaction with them.
Gameplay
Historically GTA games have focused heavily on mission-based play, requiring successful completion of fixed tasks in order for players to progress through the game, but this has changed to a great extent in GTA IV. Players will experience an entirely new and exciting emphasis centered on the blending of on-mission and off-mission play, resulting not only in an increased sense of realism, but more interesting and unrestricted gameplay.",Grand Theft Auto V  -Playstation 3,Games  World, , ,Games World, , , ,Bangladesh,English

Nine months ago, Point Man and his F.E.A.R. squad were tapped to stop a telepathically gifted cannibal who had begun a murderous rampage.

Despite this revelation, Point Man followed orders to destroy them and subsequently ravaged the surrounding city and most of his F.E.A.R. team. Now, it is clear that Alma's psychic influence survived- and worse, she is about to birth something that could destroy the world. Fettel has returned from death with an unclear agenda, refusing to leave Point Man's side and asking for help to reach Alma. The remaining F.E.A.R. squad is still trying to complete their mission.

Syndicate is the re-imagination of a cult classic franchise from 1993 - a unique action shooter set in a not too distant future, where Business is War. 2069 – No longer governed by politicians, the developed world is divided up into regions controlled by megacorporations known as Syndicates. These Syndicates have revolutionized how the consumer interacts with the digital world. No longer does the consumer require a device to access the world’s data and control their technology, they can do this at the blink of an eye via neural chip implant. Civilians flocked to be “chip’d” and enjoy all that their selected Syndicate has to offer; housing, medical, banking, insurance, education, entertainment and jobs. One complete package. One complete lifestyle. In return, the Syndicates gained unprecedented insights, and control, over the individual and their behaviour. With little governmental oversight, business has become war. The Syndicates will stop at nothing for ultimate market dominance. At the front line of this war are the Agents, the Syndicate’s bio-engineered and chip-augmented enforcers. They can breach anything in the wired world including their enemies, their weapons and the environment that surrounds them, making them the most efficient and deadly technological weapons in the world. Take on the role of Miles Kilo, Eurocorp’s latest prototype agent, and embark on a brutal action adventure of corruption and revenge.",Syndicate- Playstation 3,Games  World, , ,Games World, , , ,Bangladesh,English
