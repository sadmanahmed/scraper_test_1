Summary of the Book: 
Unarguably one of the greatest minds living on the planet, Stephen Hawking takes the reader to a breath taking journey into the depths of cosmos from big bang to big crunch, from nature of forces to the corners of multiple dimensions, from quarks to the entangled theory of strings, through the wormholes, encircling event horizons, along the arrow of time and ultimately leaving him on the edge of the universe with his ideas on the grand unification of forces – the theory of everything. Hawking being a brilliant physicist draws a stunningly simple anatomy of intricate nature of the universe through an elegantly written language of physics and mathematics and thus making even a non-scientific person understanding some of the most important aspects of working nature of the cosmos. By stimulating the existential inquisitiveness of the reader, A Brief History of Time not only awakens his interests in physics, cosmology, and particle physics but inspires the natural philosopher and the historian in him. Following the legacy of an elite bunch of people such as Kepler, Copernicus, Einstein and Sagan who brought science of universe to the general public, Hawking successfully attempts in bringing topics of black holes and wormholes to the tables of cafeterias and public media. A Brief History of Time is timeless in its own nature and deserves to be read by anyone who has a curiosity to know the origin and fate of his or her own existence.  

About the Author: 
Stephen Hawking is considered to be one of the greatest living minds existing. Born to an English family on the 300th death anniversary of Galileo, Stephen Hawking has his alma mater in the Oxford and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. After an extensive work in physics and cosmology, in his early age itself he was showing a great potential in becoming one of the leading scientists in the field. When he was 21 he was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, a progressive motor neuron disease which destroyed the ability of his muscles to move and respond. It deteriorated with time and resulting in losing almost complete capability to move his body, but his brain continued to marvel with his extraordinary theories and thoughts. In 1974 he stunned the scientific community with his thesis on black holes, now famously called as Hawking Radiation.  In 1979 he was honored with the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, which has been the epitome of all the scientific achievements. Even though he had reached a state where he needed a computerized speech synthesizer to articulate his thoughts, he wrote the magnum opus of science, A Brief History of Time which has sold more than 10 million copies. He currently holds the position of Director of Research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology within the University of Cambridge. Few of other books authored by him are The Universe in a Nutshell, The Grand Design, My Brief History, The Theory of Everything and The Nature of Space and Time.

In Crime and Punishment, Dostoevski treats the problem of crime and the criminal mentality. He is not interested in the social aspects of criminal behavior, and there is little said in the novel about the legalities of crime. Dostoevski has an interior view of criminality, a conviction that crime and its inevitable punishment are deeply seated aspects of the human spirit.

Raskolnikov (the novel’s hero) is presented from the inside. The reader knows what he did before knowing why he did it, and the story is told as a gradual revelation of the hero’s motives. That accounts for the uncanny suspense of the first several chapters: The reader continually searches for the reason that Raskolnikov has murdered the pawnbroker. Intertwined with the reader’s suspense is the slowly dawning realization that Raskolnikov himself does not know his motive. This “double suspense” creates a dense texture that gives the novel its complexity, a complexity laid over the relative simplicity of the plot.",Crime and Punishment,Fyodor Dostoyevsky, , ,Bantam Books,9780553211757,"Reissue edition,2003",576,India,English

No one likes him, not even the three sons he fathered through two marriages. His eldest son, Dmitri, is a sensualist who loves wine and women, spending a great deal of his time hankering after both. Dmitri only returns to his home for his inheritance, which he believes his father is keeping from him. The second son, Ivan, is a rationalist who is tired of all the suffering in the world. Intelligent and insufferable, he is isolated by his pride and sullen nature. The third son, Alexei, or Alyosha as he is called, is terribly unlike the rest of his family. He is universally liked, and a novice at the Russian orthodox monastery. The relationship between old man Karamazov and his sons is the focus of the novel, and when he is eventually murdered, the issues of patricide and the ethical debate of God, Free Will and morality take centre stage in Dostoyevsky’s last and perhaps greatest novel.About Fyodor DostoyevskyFyodor Mikhaylovich Dostoyevsky was a Russian writer, and philosopher. He is best remembered for Crime and Punishment and The Idiot.Dostoyevsky’s works explore the themes of human psychology in the context of the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmosphere of 19th century Russia and he has influenced generations of writers both in his homeland and abroad.The above title was adapted several times into films, most notably in 1958 by Richard Brooks, starring Yul Brynner, Richard Basehart, William Shatner and Albert Salmi.",The Brothers Karamazov,Fyodor Dostoyevsky, , ,Bantam Books,9780140449242,"Reissue Edition,2003",1056,India,English

It is symbolic that Adam Smith’s masterpiece of economic analysis, The Wealth of Nations, was first published in 1776, the same year as the Declaration of Independence.
In his book, Smith fervently extolled the simple yet enlightened notion that individuals are fully capable of setting and regulating prices for their own goods and services. He argued passionately in favor of free trade, yet stood up for the little guy. The Wealth of Nations provided the first--and still the most eloquent--integrated description of the workings of a market economy.
The result of Smith’s efforts is a witty, highly readable work of genius filled with prescient theories that form the basis of a thriving capitalist system. This unabridged edition offers the modern reader a fresh look at a timeless and seminal work that revolutionized the way governments and individuals view the creation and dispersion of wealth--and that continues to influence our economy right up to the present day.",The Wealth of Nations,Adam Smith, , ,Bantam Books,9780553585971,"1st Edition,1991",622,India,English

After translation, it is discovered that they contain a series of spiritual insights that hold the secret to understanding the future of humanity. A man must travel to Peru to find and preserve these insights in the wake of political and religious groups opposing their release.

Through this fast-paced tale of adventure, Redfield conveys his beliefs about the course that human civilization will eventually take. While formulating his deductions, he largely draws from ancient Eastern philosophies and New Thought spirituality. He also takes inference from his analysis of historical events.

He has presented a set of principles that, in his opinion, govern the universe and in turn, the human nature. He urges the readers to think beyond the three dimensions of the physical world. He introduces them to a higher level of thinking and asks them to develop the qualities that would enable them to see the unseen.

The Celestine Prophecy reached first position on The New York Times Bestseller List and remained on the list for over 3 years. It is considered as one of the most successful self-published books of all time. By May 2005, it had sold over 20 million copies worldwide and had been translated into 34 languages. It has been adapted into a film of the same name.

Echo Burning is the fifth novel in the Jack Reacher series, and it starts off with Reacher breaking the nose and finger of a man who provokes him greatly, at a saloon in Texas. It is bad luck for Reacher as the bully is a local sheriff, who brings his team of three to arrest Reacher the following day. On hearing about this, Reacher decides to flee from there, and the fastest way he can think of, is to hitchhike. He then meets Carmen Greer, who is of Mexican heritage. Carmen is in a big soup as her husband, Sloop, is on the verge of being released from prison.

She is looking out for someone who can kill her husband, as he used to ill-treat her greatly. The sole reason for her stopping when she sees Reacher is that she believes he could possibly put an end to her husband, as Reacher has an army background. Reacher refuses, and decides to step out of the vehicle, when he suddenly reconsiders, deciding to travel with Carmen. Carmen and Reacher reach the ranch, where Sloop and his entire family stay, and Reacher only acts as her bodyguard, and does not promise to do anything else. They pick up Carmen’s daughter, Ellie. What sort of a response does Carmen’s husband’s family have to these developments?

What does Reacher train Carmen in? What happens when Sloop returns? How does he react to Reacher? What happens when the police is brought into the picture? What is Sloop’s fate and how is Carmen involved in deciding that? How do Carmen’s actions affect Reacher’s life? Echo Burning answers these questions and more for the reader, providing details about the protagonist and his life through the author’s gripping style of writing.

In this book, The Class, readers are introduced to five young men who study together at Harvard University. The names of the five are Andrew Eliot, Daniel Rossi, Theodore (Ted) Lambros, Jason Gilbert, Jr., and George Keller. The five are gifted in their own way, and the book covers their life over the next 25 years, after which they all meet again. In addition to the male characters, the book also throws light on the women they get associated with.

Andrew documents every moment of his life, while George develops a liking for politics. Ted becomes a lecturer due to his newfound love in Greek classics. Danny, with talent up his sleeve, gets involved in the field of music, while Jason warms up to the traditions of the Jewish culture that he’s always been kept away from.

The book continues to guide readers through the lives of these five as they go about the 60s and 70s, and depicts their ups and downs, along with their relationships. Repressed emotions, the pursuit of one’s heritage, and adultery are all thrown into the mix in this large canvas. 
In addition to covering their lives after their graduation from Harvard, the book also provides strong insight into the lives of students who attend Harvard University.

Summary of the Book: 
Unarguably one of the greatest minds living on the planet, Stephen Hawking takes the reader to a breath taking journey into the depths of cosmos from big bang to big crunch, from nature of forces to the corners of multiple dimensions, from quarks to the entangled theory of strings, through the wormholes, encircling event horizons, along the arrow of time and ultimately leaving him on the edge of the universe with his ideas on the grand unification of forces – the theory of everything. Hawking being a brilliant physicist draws a stunningly simple anatomy of intricate nature of the universe through an elegantly written language of physics and mathematics and thus making even a non-scientific person understanding some of the most important aspects of working nature of the cosmos. By stimulating the existential inquisitiveness of the reader, A Brief History of Time not only awakens his interests in physics, cosmology, and particle physics but inspires the natural philosopher and the historian in him. Following the legacy of an elite bunch of people such as Kepler, Copernicus, Einstein and Sagan who brought science of universe to the general public, Hawking successfully attempts in bringing topics of black holes and wormholes to the tables of cafeterias and public media. A Brief History of Time is timeless in its own nature and deserves to be read by anyone who has a curiosity to know the origin and fate of his or her own existence.  

About the Author: 
Stephen Hawking is considered to be one of the greatest living minds existing. Born to an English family on the 300th death anniversary of Galileo, Stephen Hawking has his alma mater in the Oxford and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. After an extensive work in physics and cosmology, in his early age itself he was showing a great potential in becoming one of the leading scientists in the field. When he was 21 he was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, a progressive motor neuron disease which destroyed the ability of his muscles to move and respond. It deteriorated with time and resulting in losing almost complete capability to move his body, but his brain continued to marvel with his extraordinary theories and thoughts. In 1974 he stunned the scientific community with his thesis on black holes, now famously called as Hawking Radiation.  In 1979 he was honored with the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, which has been the epitome of all the scientific achievements. Even though he had reached a state where he needed a computerized speech synthesizer to articulate his thoughts, he wrote the magnum opus of science, A Brief History of Time which has sold more than 10 million copies. He currently holds the position of Director of Research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology within the University of Cambridge. Few of other books authored by him are The Universe in a Nutshell, The Grand Design, My Brief History, The Theory of Everything and The Nature of Space and Time.

In Crime and Punishment, Dostoevski treats the problem of crime and the criminal mentality. He is not interested in the social aspects of criminal behavior, and there is little said in the novel about the legalities of crime. Dostoevski has an interior view of criminality, a conviction that crime and its inevitable punishment are deeply seated aspects of the human spirit.

Raskolnikov (the novel’s hero) is presented from the inside. The reader knows what he did before knowing why he did it, and the story is told as a gradual revelation of the hero’s motives. That accounts for the uncanny suspense of the first several chapters: The reader continually searches for the reason that Raskolnikov has murdered the pawnbroker. Intertwined with the reader’s suspense is the slowly dawning realization that Raskolnikov himself does not know his motive. This “double suspense” creates a dense texture that gives the novel its complexity, a complexity laid over the relative simplicity of the plot.",Crime and Punishment,Fyodor Dostoyevsky, , ,Bantam Books,9780553211757,"Reissue edition,2003",576,India,English

No one likes him, not even the three sons he fathered through two marriages. His eldest son, Dmitri, is a sensualist who loves wine and women, spending a great deal of his time hankering after both. Dmitri only returns to his home for his inheritance, which he believes his father is keeping from him. The second son, Ivan, is a rationalist who is tired of all the suffering in the world. Intelligent and insufferable, he is isolated by his pride and sullen nature. The third son, Alexei, or Alyosha as he is called, is terribly unlike the rest of his family. He is universally liked, and a novice at the Russian orthodox monastery. The relationship between old man Karamazov and his sons is the focus of the novel, and when he is eventually murdered, the issues of patricide and the ethical debate of God, Free Will and morality take centre stage in Dostoyevsky’s last and perhaps greatest novel.About Fyodor DostoyevskyFyodor Mikhaylovich Dostoyevsky was a Russian writer, and philosopher.

It is symbolic that Adam Smith’s masterpiece of economic analysis, The Wealth of Nations, was first published in 1776, the same year as the Declaration of Independence.
In his book, Smith fervently extolled the simple yet enlightened notion that individuals are fully capable of setting and regulating prices for their own goods and services. He argued passionately in favor of free trade, yet stood up for the little guy. The Wealth of Nations provided the first--and still the most eloquent--integrated description of the workings of a market economy.
The result of Smith’s efforts is a witty, highly readable work of genius filled with prescient theories that form the basis of a thriving capitalist system. This unabridged edition offers the modern reader a fresh look at a timeless and seminal work that revolutionized the way governments and individuals view the creation and dispersion of wealth--and that continues to influence our economy right up to the present day.",The Wealth of Nations,Adam Smith, , ,Bantam Books,9780553585971,"1st Edition,1991",622,India,English

After translation, it is discovered that they contain a series of spiritual insights that hold the secret to understanding the future of humanity. A man must travel to Peru to find and preserve these insights in the wake of political and religious groups opposing their release.

Through this fast-paced tale of adventure, Redfield conveys his beliefs about the course that human civilization will eventually take. While formulating his deductions, he largely draws from ancient Eastern philosophies and New Thought spirituality. He also takes inference from his analysis of historical events.

He has presented a set of principles that, in his opinion, govern the universe and in turn, the human nature. He urges the readers to think beyond the three dimensions of the physical world. He introduces them to a higher level of thinking and asks them to develop the qualities that would enable them to see the unseen.

The Celestine Prophecy reached first position on The New York Times Bestseller List and remained on the list for over 3 years. It is considered as one of the most successful self-published books of all time. By May 2005, it had sold over 20 million copies worldwide and had been translated into 34 languages. It has been adapted into a film of the same name.

Echo Burning is the fifth novel in the Jack Reacher series, and it starts off with Reacher breaking the nose and finger of a man who provokes him greatly, at a saloon in Texas. It is bad luck for Reacher as the bully is a local sheriff, who brings his team of three to arrest Reacher the following day. On hearing about this, Reacher decides to flee from there, and the fastest way he can think of, is to hitchhike. He then meets Carmen Greer, who is of Mexican heritage. Carmen is in a big soup as her husband, Sloop, is on the verge of being released from prison.

She is looking out for someone who can kill her husband, as he used to ill-treat her greatly. The sole reason for her stopping when she sees Reacher is that she believes he could possibly put an end to her husband, as Reacher has an army background. Reacher refuses, and decides to step out of the vehicle, when he suddenly reconsiders, deciding to travel with Carmen. Carmen and Reacher reach the ranch, where Sloop and his entire family stay, and Reacher only acts as her bodyguard, and does not promise to do anything else. They pick up Carmen’s daughter, Ellie. What sort of a response does Carmen’s husband’s family have to these developments?

What does Reacher train Carmen in? What happens when Sloop returns? How does he react to Reacher? What happens when the police is brought into the picture? What is Sloop’s fate and how is Carmen involved in deciding that? How do Carmen’s actions affect Reacher’s life? Echo Burning answers these questions and more for the reader, providing details about the protagonist and his life through the author’s gripping style of writing.

In this book, The Class, readers are introduced to five young men who study together at Harvard University. The names of the five are Andrew Eliot, Daniel Rossi, Theodore (Ted) Lambros, Jason Gilbert, Jr., and George Keller. The five are gifted in their own way, and the book covers their life over the next 25 years, after which they all meet again. In addition to the male characters, the book also throws light on the women they get associated with.

Andrew documents every moment of his life, while George develops a liking for politics. Ted becomes a lecturer due to his newfound love in Greek classics. Danny, with talent up his sleeve, gets involved in the field of music, while Jason warms up to the traditions of the Jewish culture that he’s always been kept away from.

The book continues to guide readers through the lives of these five as they go about the 60s and 70s, and depicts their ups and downs, along with their relationships. Repressed emotions, the pursuit of one’s heritage, and adultery are all thrown into the mix in this large canvas. 
In addition to covering their lives after their graduation from Harvard, the book also provides strong insight into the lives of students who attend Harvard University.
