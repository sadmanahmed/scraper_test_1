standing up to his height of ideas and imagination and thus
redefines the romantic.
In the book the author tells stories about people who are
young, old and ordinary and recounts stories of rural folks. As
he travels, he smells the aroma of paddy fields and just-mown
grass. He sees mountains running parallel to highways and
boats sailing in rivers. He enjoys the romance of flying, driving
car and riding bicycle. Finally, he takes a romantic view of
Bangladesh’s future.
The forty stories in The Romantic could be likened to hop, step
and jump in a track event.
