PREFACE
Two Suzukis. A half-century ago, in a transplant that has been likened in its historical importance to the Latin translations of Aristotle in the thirteenth century and of Plato in the fifteenth, daisetz Suzuki brought Zen to the west single-handed. Fifty years later, Shunryu Suzuki did something almost as important. He sounded exactly the follow-up note Americans interested in Zen need to hear. 
Whereas Daisetz Suzukis Zen was dramatic, Shunryu Suzuki`s is ordinary. Satori was focal for daises, and it was in large part the fascination of this extraordinary state that made his writings so compelling. In shunryu Suzuki’s book the words satori and kensho, its near-equivalent, never appear. 
When, four months before his death, I had the opportunity to ask him why satori didn’t figure in his book, his wife leaned toward me and whispered impishly, “It’s because he hasn’t had it”; whereupon the Roshi batted his fan at her in mock consternation and with finger to his lips hissed, ``shhhh! Don’t till him!” When our laughter had subsided, he said simply, “It’s not that satori is unimportant, but it’s not the part of Zen that needs to be stressed” 
Suzuki-roshi was with us, in America, only twelve years a single round in the East Asian way of counting years in dozens but they were enough. Through the work of this small, quiet man there is now a thriving Soto Zen organization on our continent. His life represented the Soto way so perfectly that the man and the way were merged. “His nonego attitude left us no eccentricities   to embroider upon. Though he made no waves and left no traces as a personality in the worldly sense, the impress of his footsteps in the invisible world of history lead straight on” * His monuments are the first Soto Zen monastery in the west the Zen Mountain Center at Tassajara; its city adjunct, the Zen Center in san Francisco; and, for the Public at large, this book.  
Leaving nothing to chance, he prepared his students for their most difficult moment, when his palpable presence would vanish into the void: 
If when I die, the moment I’m dying, if I suffer that is all right, you know; that is suffering Buddha. No confusion in it. Maybe everyone will struggle because of the physical agony or spiritual ago one, too. But that is all right, that is not a problem. We should be very grateful to have a limited body like mine or like yours. If you had a limitless life it would be a real problem for you. 
And he secured the transmission. In the Mountain Seat ceremony, November 21, 1971. He installed Richard Baker as his Dharma heir. His cancer had advanced to the point where he could march in the processional only supported

The Art of War,সান জু,TK. 358,"",https://rokomari.com//book/153588/the-art-of-war,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/d9dd5dea1_153588.jpg,"'The Art of War' Summary of the book
The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Late Spring and Autumn Period (roughly 5th century BC). The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (""Master Sun"", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to an aspect of warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare[1] and has influenced both Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy and beyond.

This book contained a detailed explanation and analysis of the Chinese military, from weapons and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun Tzu also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Because Sun Tzu has long been considered to be one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training for centuries to come.
Chapter summary
1. Detail assessment and planning: explores the five fundamental factors (the Way, seasons, terrain, leadership, and management) and seven elements that determine the outcomes of military engagements. By thinking, assessing and comparing these points, a commander can calculate his chances of victory. Habitual deviation from these calculations will ensure failure via improper action. The text stresses that war is a very grave matter for the state and must not be commenced without due consideration.
2. Waging war : explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how success requires winning decisive engagements quickly. This section advises that successful military campaigns require limiting the cost of competition and conflict.
3. Strategic attack : defines the source of strength as unity, not size, and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war. In order of importance, these critical factors are: Attack, Strategy, Alliances, Army and Cities.
4. Disposition of the army : explains the importance of defending existing positions until a commander is capable of advancing from those positions in safety. It teaches commanders the importance of recognizing strategic opportunities, and teaches not to create opportunities for the enemy.
5. Forces : explains the use of creativity and timing in building an army's momentum.
6. Weaknesses and strengths : explains how an army's opportunities come from the openings in the environment caused by the relative weakness of the enemy and how to respond to changes in the fluid battlefield over a given area.
7. Military maneuvers : explains the dangers of direct conflict and how to win those confrontations when they are forced upon the commander.
8. Variations and adaptability : focuses on the need for flexibility in an army's responses. It explains how to respond to shifting circumstances successfully.
9. Movement and development of troops : describes the different situations in which an army finds itself as it moves through new enemy territories, and how to respond to these situations. Much of this section focuses on evaluating the intentions of others.
10. Terrain : looks at the three general areas of resistance (distance, dangers and barriers) and the six types of ground positions that arise from them. Each of these six field positions offers certain advantages and disadvantages.
11. The nine battlegrounds : describes the nine common situations (or stages) in a campaign, from scattering to deadly, and the specific focus that a commander will need in order to successfully navigate them.
12. Attacking with fire : explains the general use of weapons and the specific use of the environment as a weapon. This section examines the five targets for attack, the five types of environmental attack and the appropriate responses to such attacks.
13. Intelligence and espionage : focuses on the importance of developing good information sources, and specifies the five types of intelligence sources and how to best manage each of them.",The Art of War,Sun Tzu, , ,Shambhala,9781569571576,"1st Editon,2017",292,India,English
