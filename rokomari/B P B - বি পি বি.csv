Understanding pointers in provide C programmers all the information they need about pointers in the C programming language. It can be rightly said that a C programmer without a sound understanding of pointers is like a fish who can’t swim. Pointers are actually variables that are used for storing addresses, and can also be null. Pointers are useful for expressing a number of computations, helping to produce efficient and compact code. To tap into their full potential, the programmer needs to have a solid grounding in the subject, which is provided in understanding pointers in C. Errors often crop up in code if the programmer is not aware of the usage of pointers, thereby, making it important to study this subject meticulously. There are seven chapters in this book, which include applications of pointers, pointers and data structures, pointers and arrays, pointers and structures, introduction to pointers, pointers miscellany, and pointers and strings. Through the course of this book, kanetkar explains a number of related concepts in an easy to understand manner. He delves into a number of crucial aspects such as the relationship between arrays and pointers, dynamic memory allocation, structures, and variable arguments list. He also throws light on the application of pointers at the end of the book. Kanetkar explains all the important concepts in a step-by-step manner, which helps the readers understand the concepts better. This book provides the readers with detailed information on pointers, and is suitable for students as well as practicing engineers.",Understanding Pointers In C,Yashavant Kanetkar, , ,B P B,9788176563581,"Reprinted,2017",535,India,English

Understanding pointers in provide C programmers all the information they need about pointers in the C programming language. It can be rightly said that a C programmer without a sound understanding of pointers is like a fish who can’t swim. Pointers are actually variables that are used for storing addresses, and can also be null. Pointers are useful for expressing a number of computations, helping to produce efficient and compact code. To tap into their full potential, the programmer needs to have a solid grounding in the subject, which is provided in understanding pointers in C. Errors often crop up in code if the programmer is not aware of the usage of pointers, thereby, making it important to study this subject meticulously. There are seven chapters in this book, which include applications of pointers, pointers and data structures, pointers and arrays, pointers and structures, introduction to pointers, pointers miscellany, and pointers and strings. Through the course of this book, kanetkar explains a number of related concepts in an easy to understand manner. He delves into a number of crucial aspects such as the relationship between arrays and pointers, dynamic memory allocation, structures, and variable arguments list. He also throws light on the application of pointers at the end of the book. Kanetkar explains all the important concepts in a step-by-step manner, which helps the readers understand the concepts better. This book provides the readers with detailed information on pointers, and is suitable for students as well as practicing engineers.",Understanding Pointers In C,Yashavant Kanetkar, , ,B P B,9788176563581,"Reprinted,2017",535,India,English
