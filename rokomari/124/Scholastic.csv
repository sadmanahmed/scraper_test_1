The Hunger Games Trilogy (Set Of 3 Books) consists of the three books, The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay. The books are set in an uncertain future in the totalitarian regime of Panem, created after the destruction of North America. The entire country is dominated by the rich state known as the Capitol.

In the Capitol, the people are rich and live lavish lives. In the rest of the districts, however, the conditions are deplorable and the people extremely poor. The Capitol arranges an annual event called The Hunger Games, in which, citizens from the rest of the 12 districts fight till their death in a dangerous arena which is televised to the entire country. The citizens are selected by lottery. The district that wins, receive numerous rewards, food and supplies for its people from the Capitol. The event serves as entertainment to the Capitol and is a method for them to assert their dominance.

In the story, Katniss Evergreen volunteers to participate in place of her sister when she is selected to participate by lottery. The trilogy follows her as she faces many dangers in the course of the games. Further along the trilogy, the other districts rise in rebellion against the dictatorship of the Capitol and its leader, President Snow. Katniss is a major part of the rebellion. The trilogy weaves its way through a number of conspiracies, plans and twists.

The Hunger Games Trilogy (Set Of 3 Books) has been extremely well received by the worldwide audience. It has been one of the best selling series of all time with over 26 million books sold. The books have been adapted to film. The first book, The Hunger Games, was released as a film in March 2012. The second book, Catching Fire, was released in November 2013 and the third film on Mockingjay, is to be released in two parts soon.

Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.

Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.

In Catching Fire, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.",Catching Fire: The Hunger Games (Book 2),Suzanne Collins, , ,Scholastic,9789351035978,"Reissue,2016",391,India,English

The prom. It's supposed to be one of the best nights of your life. Or, at least, you're supposed to have a good time. But what if you'd rather be going with your best friend's date than your own? What if a sinister underground society of students has spiked the punch? What if your date turns out to be more of a frog than a prince? Or what if he's (literally) an ape? 

There are ways you can fight it. You can protest the silliness of the regular prom by hosting a backwards prom - also known as a morp. You can throw a prom for fat girls. You can stay at home to watch old teen movies and get your cute neighbor and his cuter brother to join you. You can dance to your own music.

Here, 21 of the funniest, most imaginative writers today create their own kind of prom stories. Some are triumphs. Some are disasters.

The main characters are Trina O'Dell and her brother, Dan O'Dell. Their father, Danny O'Dell, collects various ventriloquist dummies. One day, Mr. O'Dell brings Slappy home after finding him in a dumpster. After repairing his broken shaft, he names him Smiley, unaware of the dummy's past. Trina finds a piece of paper in Slappy's front pocket and reads it. Shortly after, Slappy slaps her across the face. Naturally, nobody believes her. Trina and Dan's cousin, Zane, is coming for a visit. Their father makes them promise not to scare Zane, as they had done in a previous visit. After a while, one of the dummies called Rocky pops up in weird places, scaring Zane while Trina and Dan get the blame for each incident. Many things are ruined: Zane's camera, the dinner table, and the film in Zane's camera by the dummy.

Dan and Trina eventually catch Zane taking Rocky from the attic and it is revealed that Zane was placing Rocky in the weird places for fun. The three make a truce not to prank each other like that going forward. More catastrophes occur afterward, each with Rocky at the scene of the crime. Dan suspects Zane and tells Trina, but nobody else believes them. To prove that Zane is guilty, Dan and Trina sneak up to the attic to wait for Zane to come up and steal Rocky.

To their horror, they discover Slappy trying to sneak off with Rocky, and Slappy tells them that they are his slaves. Dan and Trina try to dump Slappy in a well, but he comes back the next morning. Trina thinks back and remembers the magic words she read to bring Slappy to life. Trina thought it could put him to sleep as well. Trina and Dan sneak up into the attic and read the magic words out loud. Slappy is still alive and well, but all of the other dummies come to life. They all huddle around Slappy, as he screams. It is then described that the dummies ""pulled and tugged him,"" but Slappy is not killed. Afterward, all the dummies fall down lifeless just as Zane walks into the attic. Zane spots Dan and Trina in the attic with the dummies lying around and rats them out to their father.

The next day, Zane leaves to go back home with his father. After being asked to give Zane a dummy, Trina gives Zane Slappy as a parting gift as payback for getting her and Dan grounded. Trina watches Zane get into the car and sees the dummy wink at her.",Goosebumps (Night of the Living Dummy iii),R.L. Stine, , ,Scholastic,9780590568777,"Reprinted,2017",126,India,English

Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.

Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.

In Catching Fire, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.",Catching Fire: The Hunger Games (Book 2),Suzanne Collins, , ,Scholastic,9789351035978,"Reissue,2016",391,India,English

The prom. It's supposed to be one of the best nights of your life. Or, at least, you're supposed to have a good time. But what if you'd rather be going with your best friend's date than your own? What if a sinister underground society of students has spiked the punch? What if your date turns out to be more of a frog than a prince? Or what if he's (literally) an ape? 

There are ways you can fight it. You can protest the silliness of the regular prom by hosting a backwards prom - also known as a morp. You can throw a prom for fat girls. You can stay at home to watch old teen movies and get your cute neighbor and his cuter brother to join you. You can dance to your own music.

Here, 21 of the funniest, most imaginative writers today create their own kind of prom stories. Some are triumphs. Some are disasters.

The main characters are Trina O'Dell and her brother, Dan O'Dell. Their father, Danny O'Dell, collects various ventriloquist dummies. One day, Mr. O'Dell brings Slappy home after finding him in a dumpster. After repairing his broken shaft, he names him Smiley, unaware of the dummy's past. Trina finds a piece of paper in Slappy's front pocket and reads it. Shortly after, Slappy slaps her across the face. Naturally, nobody believes her. Trina and Dan's cousin, Zane, is coming for a visit. Their father makes them promise not to scare Zane, as they had done in a previous visit. After a while, one of the dummies called Rocky pops up in weird places, scaring Zane while Trina and Dan get the blame for each incident. Many things are ruined: Zane's camera, the dinner table, and the film in Zane's camera by the dummy.

Dan and Trina eventually catch Zane taking Rocky from the attic and it is revealed that Zane was placing Rocky in the weird places for fun. The three make a truce not to prank each other like that going forward. More catastrophes occur afterward, each with Rocky at the scene of the crime. Dan suspects Zane and tells Trina, but nobody else believes them. To prove that Zane is guilty, Dan and Trina sneak up to the attic to wait for Zane to come up and steal Rocky.

To their horror, they discover Slappy trying to sneak off with Rocky, and Slappy tells them that they are his slaves. Dan and Trina try to dump Slappy in a well, but he comes back the next morning. Trina thinks back and remembers the magic words she read to bring Slappy to life. Trina thought it could put him to sleep as well. Trina and Dan sneak up into the attic and read the magic words out loud. Slappy is still alive and well, but all of the other dummies come to life. They all huddle around Slappy, as he screams. It is then described that the dummies ""pulled and tugged him,"" but Slappy is not killed. Afterward, all the dummies fall down lifeless just as Zane walks into the attic. Zane spots Dan and Trina in the attic with the dummies lying around and rats them out to their father.

The next day, Zane leaves to go back home with his father. After being asked to give Zane a dummy, Trina gives Zane Slappy as a parting gift as payback for getting her and Dan grounded. Trina watches Zane get into the car and sees the dummy wink at her.",Goosebumps (Night of the Living Dummy iii),R.L. Stine, , ,Scholastic,9780590568777,"Reprinted,2017",126,India,English

In the Capitol, the people are rich and live lavish lives. In the rest of the districts, however, the conditions are deplorable and the people extremely poor. The Capitol arranges an annual event called The Hunger Games, in which, citizens from the rest of the 12 districts fight till their death in a dangerous arena which is televised to the entire country. The citizens are selected by lottery. The district that wins, receive numerous rewards, food and supplies for its people from the Capitol. The event serves as entertainment to the Capitol and is a method for them to assert their dominance.

In the story, Katniss Evergreen volunteers to participate in place of her sister when she is selected to participate by lottery. The trilogy follows her as she faces many dangers in the course of the games. Further along the trilogy, the other districts rise in rebellion against the dictatorship of the Capitol and its leader, President Snow. Katniss is a major part of the rebellion. The trilogy weaves its way through a number of conspiracies, plans and twists.

The books have been adapted to film. The first book, The Hunger Games, was released as a film in March 2012.

Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.

Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.

In Catching Fire, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.",Catching Fire: The Hunger Games (Book 2),Suzanne Collins, , ,Scholastic,9789351035978,"Reissue,2016",391,India,English

What if a sinister underground society of students has spiked the punch? What if your date turns out to be more of a frog than a prince? Or what if he's (literally) an ape? 

There are ways you can fight it. You can protest the silliness of the regular prom by hosting a backwards prom - also known as a morp. You can throw a prom for fat girls. You can stay at home to watch old teen movies and get your cute neighbor and his cuter brother to join you. You can dance to your own music.

The main characters are Trina O'Dell and her brother, Dan O'Dell. Their father, Danny O'Dell, collects various ventriloquist dummies. One day, Mr. O'Dell brings Slappy home after finding him in a dumpster. After repairing his broken shaft, he names him Smiley, unaware of the dummy's past. Trina finds a piece of paper in Slappy's front pocket and reads it. Shortly after, Slappy slaps her across the face. Naturally, nobody believes her. Trina and Dan's cousin, Zane, is coming for a visit. Their father makes them promise not to scare Zane, as they had done in a previous visit. After a while, one of the dummies called Rocky pops up in weird places, scaring Zane while Trina and Dan get the blame for each incident. Many things are ruined: Zane's camera, the dinner table, and the film in Zane's camera by the dummy.

Dan and Trina eventually catch Zane taking Rocky from the attic and it is revealed that Zane was placing Rocky in the weird places for fun. The three make a truce not to prank each other like that going forward. More catastrophes occur afterward, each with Rocky at the scene of the crime. Dan suspects Zane and tells Trina, but nobody else believes them. To prove that Zane is guilty, Dan and Trina sneak up to the attic to wait for Zane to come up and steal Rocky.

To their horror, they discover Slappy trying to sneak off with Rocky, and Slappy tells them that they are his slaves. Dan and Trina try to dump Slappy in a well, but he comes back the next morning. Trina thinks back and remembers the magic words she read to bring Slappy to life. Trina thought it could put him to sleep as well. Trina and Dan sneak up into the attic and read the magic words out loud. Slappy is still alive and well, but all of the other dummies come to life. They all huddle around Slappy, as he screams. It is then described that the dummies ""pulled and tugged him,"" but Slappy is not killed. Afterward, all the dummies fall down lifeless just as Zane walks into the attic. Zane spots Dan and Trina in the attic with the dummies lying around and rats them out to their father.

The next day, Zane leaves to go back home with his father. After being asked to give Zane a dummy, Trina gives Zane Slappy as a parting gift as payback for getting her and Dan grounded. Trina watches Zane get into the car and sees the dummy wink at her.",Goosebumps (Night of the Living Dummy iii),R.L. Stine, , ,Scholastic,9780590568777,"Reprinted,2017",126,India,English

Who is Geronimo Stilton? 
That's me! I run a newspaper, but my true passion is writing adventure stories. Here in New Mouse City, the capital of Mouse Island, my books are all bestsellers! My stories are funny, fa-mouse-ly funny. They are whisker-licking-good tales, and that's a promise!
GERONIMO STILTON

A CHEESE-COLORED CAMPER 
My grandfather William Shortpaws was back at The Rodent's Gazette, and he was determined to drive me up a clock! He wanted to publish a guide book to Ratzikistan, the coldest, darkest, most remote spot on all of Mouse Island. And he wanted me to write it! So he packed up his cheesecolored camper, and we were on our way.

The Hunger Games Trilogy (Set Of 3 Books) consists of the three books, The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay. The books are set in an uncertain future in the totalitarian regime of Panem, created after the destruction of North America. The entire country is dominated by the rich state known as the Capitol.

In the Capitol, the people are rich and live lavish lives. In the rest of the districts, however, the conditions are deplorable and the people extremely poor. The Capitol arranges an annual event called The Hunger Games, in which, citizens from the rest of the 12 districts fight till their death in a dangerous arena which is televised to the entire country. The citizens are selected by lottery. The district that wins, receive numerous rewards, food and supplies for its people from the Capitol. The event serves as entertainment to the Capitol and is a method for them to assert their dominance.

In the story, Katniss Evergreen volunteers to participate in place of her sister when she is selected to participate by lottery. The trilogy follows her as she faces many dangers in the course of the games. Further along the trilogy, the other districts rise in rebellion against the dictatorship of the Capitol and its leader, President Snow. Katniss is a major part of the rebellion. The trilogy weaves its way through a number of conspiracies, plans and twists.

The Hunger Games Trilogy (Set Of 3 Books) has been extremely well received by the worldwide audience. It has been one of the best selling series of all time with over 26 million books sold. The books have been adapted to film. The first book, The Hunger Games, was released as a film in March 2012.

Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.

Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.

In Catching Fire, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.",Catching Fire: The Hunger Games (Book 2),Suzanne Collins, , ,Scholastic,9789351035978,"Reissue,2016",391,India,English

The prom. It's supposed to be one of the best nights of your life. Or, at least, you're supposed to have a good time. But what if you'd rather be going with your best friend's date than your own? What if a sinister underground society of students has spiked the punch? What if your date turns out to be more of a frog than a prince? Or what if he's (literally) an ape? 

There are ways you can fight it. You can protest the silliness of the regular prom by hosting a backwards prom - also known as a morp. You can throw a prom for fat girls. You can stay at home to watch old teen movies and get your cute neighbor and his cuter brother to join you. You can dance to your own music.

The main characters are Trina O'Dell and her brother, Dan O'Dell. Their father, Danny O'Dell, collects various ventriloquist dummies. One day, Mr. O'Dell brings Slappy home after finding him in a dumpster. After repairing his broken shaft, he names him Smiley, unaware of the dummy's past. Trina finds a piece of paper in Slappy's front pocket and reads it. Shortly after, Slappy slaps her across the face. Naturally, nobody believes her. Trina and Dan's cousin, Zane, is coming for a visit. Their father makes them promise not to scare Zane, as they had done in a previous visit. After a while, one of the dummies called Rocky pops up in weird places, scaring Zane while Trina and Dan get the blame for each incident. Many things are ruined: Zane's camera, the dinner table, and the film in Zane's camera by the dummy.

Dan and Trina eventually catch Zane taking Rocky from the attic and it is revealed that Zane was placing Rocky in the weird places for fun. The three make a truce not to prank each other like that going forward. More catastrophes occur afterward, each with Rocky at the scene of the crime. Dan suspects Zane and tells Trina, but nobody else believes them. To prove that Zane is guilty, Dan and Trina sneak up to the attic to wait for Zane to come up and steal Rocky.

To their horror, they discover Slappy trying to sneak off with Rocky, and Slappy tells them that they are his slaves. Dan and Trina try to dump Slappy in a well, but he comes back the next morning. Trina thinks back and remembers the magic words she read to bring Slappy to life. Trina thought it could put him to sleep as well. Trina and Dan sneak up into the attic and read the magic words out loud. Slappy is still alive and well, but all of the other dummies come to life. They all huddle around Slappy, as he screams. It is then described that the dummies ""pulled and tugged him,"" but Slappy is not killed. Afterward, all the dummies fall down lifeless just as Zane walks into the attic. Zane spots Dan and Trina in the attic with the dummies lying around and rats them out to their father.

The next day, Zane leaves to go back home with his father. After being asked to give Zane a dummy, Trina gives Zane Slappy as a parting gift as payback for getting her and Dan grounded. Trina watches Zane get into the car and sees the dummy wink at her.",Goosebumps (Night of the Living Dummy iii),R.L. Stine, , ,Scholastic,9780590568777,"Reprinted,2017",126,India,English

Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.

Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.

In Catching Fire, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.",Catching Fire: The Hunger Games (Book 2),Suzanne Collins, , ,Scholastic,9789351035978,"Reissue,2016",391,India,English

The prom. It's supposed to be one of the best nights of your life. Or, at least, you're supposed to have a good time. But what if you'd rather be going with your best friend's date than your own? What if a sinister underground society of students has spiked the punch? What if your date turns out to be more of a frog than a prince? Or what if he's (literally) an ape? 

There are ways you can fight it. You can protest the silliness of the regular prom by hosting a backwards prom - also known as a morp. You can throw a prom for fat girls.

The main characters are Trina O'Dell and her brother, Dan O'Dell. Their father, Danny O'Dell, collects various ventriloquist dummies. One day, Mr. O'Dell brings Slappy home after finding him in a dumpster. After repairing his broken shaft, he names him Smiley, unaware of the dummy's past. Trina finds a piece of paper in Slappy's front pocket and reads it. Shortly after, Slappy slaps her across the face. Naturally, nobody believes her. Trina and Dan's cousin, Zane, is coming for a visit. Their father makes them promise not to scare Zane, as they had done in a previous visit. After a while, one of the dummies called Rocky pops up in weird places, scaring Zane while Trina and Dan get the blame for each incident. Many things are ruined: Zane's camera, the dinner table, and the film in Zane's camera by the dummy.

Dan and Trina eventually catch Zane taking Rocky from the attic and it is revealed that Zane was placing Rocky in the weird places for fun. The three make a truce not to prank each other like that going forward. More catastrophes occur afterward, each with Rocky at the scene of the crime. Dan suspects Zane and tells Trina, but nobody else believes them. To prove that Zane is guilty, Dan and Trina sneak up to the attic to wait for Zane to come up and steal Rocky.

To their horror, they discover Slappy trying to sneak off with Rocky, and Slappy tells them that they are his slaves. Dan and Trina try to dump Slappy in a well, but he comes back the next morning. Trina thinks back and remembers the magic words she read to bring Slappy to life. Trina thought it could put him to sleep as well. Trina and Dan sneak up into the attic and read the magic words out loud. Slappy is still alive and well, but all of the other dummies come to life. They all huddle around Slappy, as he screams. It is then described that the dummies ""pulled and tugged him,"" but Slappy is not killed. Afterward, all the dummies fall down lifeless just as Zane walks into the attic. Zane spots Dan and Trina in the attic with the dummies lying around and rats them out to their father.

The next day, Zane leaves to go back home with his father. After being asked to give Zane a dummy, Trina gives Zane Slappy as a parting gift as payback for getting her and Dan grounded. Trina watches Zane get into the car and sees the dummy wink at her.",Goosebumps (Night of the Living Dummy iii),R.L. Stine, , ,Scholastic,9780590568777,"Reprinted,2017",126,India,English

In the Capitol, the people are rich and live lavish lives. In the rest of the districts, however, the conditions are deplorable and the people extremely poor. The Capitol arranges an annual event called The Hunger Games, in which, citizens from the rest of the 12 districts fight till their death in a dangerous arena which is televised to the entire country. The citizens are selected by lottery. The district that wins, receive numerous rewards, food and supplies for its people from the Capitol. The event serves as entertainment to the Capitol and is a method for them to assert their dominance.

In the story, Katniss Evergreen volunteers to participate in place of her sister when she is selected to participate by lottery. The trilogy follows her as she faces many dangers in the course of the games. Further along the trilogy, the other districts rise in rebellion against the dictatorship of the Capitol and its leader, President Snow. Katniss is a major part of the rebellion. The trilogy weaves its way through a number of conspiracies, plans and twists.

The books have been adapted to film. The first book, The Hunger Games, was released as a film in March 2012.

Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.

Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.

In Catching Fire, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.",Catching Fire: The Hunger Games (Book 2),Suzanne Collins, , ,Scholastic,9789351035978,"Reissue,2016",391,India,English

What if a sinister underground society of students has spiked the punch? What if your date turns out to be more of a frog than a prince? Or what if he's (literally) an ape? 

There are ways you can fight it. You can protest the silliness of the regular prom by hosting a backwards prom - also known as a morp. You can throw a prom for fat girls. You can stay at home to watch old teen movies and get your cute neighbor and his cuter brother to join you. You can dance to your own music.

The main characters are Trina O'Dell and her brother, Dan O'Dell. Their father, Danny O'Dell, collects various ventriloquist dummies. One day, Mr. O'Dell brings Slappy home after finding him in a dumpster. After repairing his broken shaft, he names him Smiley, unaware of the dummy's past. Trina finds a piece of paper in Slappy's front pocket and reads it. Shortly after, Slappy slaps her across the face. Naturally, nobody believes her. Trina and Dan's cousin, Zane, is coming for a visit. Their father makes them promise not to scare Zane, as they had done in a previous visit. After a while, one of the dummies called Rocky pops up in weird places, scaring Zane while Trina and Dan get the blame for each incident. Many things are ruined: Zane's camera, the dinner table, and the film in Zane's camera by the dummy.

Dan and Trina eventually catch Zane taking Rocky from the attic and it is revealed that Zane was placing Rocky in the weird places for fun. The three make a truce not to prank each other like that going forward. More catastrophes occur afterward, each with Rocky at the scene of the crime. Dan suspects Zane and tells Trina, but nobody else believes them. To prove that Zane is guilty, Dan and Trina sneak up to the attic to wait for Zane to come up and steal Rocky.

To their horror, they discover Slappy trying to sneak off with Rocky, and Slappy tells them that they are his slaves. Dan and Trina try to dump Slappy in a well, but he comes back the next morning. Trina thinks back and remembers the magic words she read to bring Slappy to life. Trina thought it could put him to sleep as well. Trina and Dan sneak up into the attic and read the magic words out loud. Slappy is still alive and well, but all of the other dummies come to life. They all huddle around Slappy, as he screams. It is then described that the dummies ""pulled and tugged him,"" but Slappy is not killed. Afterward, all the dummies fall down lifeless just as Zane walks into the attic. Zane spots Dan and Trina in the attic with the dummies lying around and rats them out to their father.

The next day, Zane leaves to go back home with his father. After being asked to give Zane a dummy, Trina gives Zane Slappy as a parting gift as payback for getting her and Dan grounded. Trina watches Zane get into the car and sees the dummy wink at her.",Goosebumps (Night of the Living Dummy iii),R.L. Stine, , ,Scholastic,9780590568777,"Reprinted,2017",126,India,English

A CHEESE-COLORED CAMPER 
My grandfather William Shortpaws was back at The Rodent's Gazette, and he was determined to drive me up a clock! He wanted to publish a guide book to Ratzikistan, the coldest, darkest, most remote spot on all of Mouse Island. And he wanted me to write it!

The Hunger Games Trilogy (Set Of 3 Books) consists of the three books, The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay. The books are set in an uncertain future in the totalitarian regime of Panem, created after the destruction of North America. The entire country is dominated by the rich state known as the Capitol.

In the Capitol, the people are rich and live lavish lives. In the rest of the districts, however, the conditions are deplorable and the people extremely poor. The Capitol arranges an annual event called The Hunger Games, in which, citizens from the rest of the 12 districts fight till their death in a dangerous arena which is televised to the entire country. The citizens are selected by lottery. The district that wins, receive numerous rewards, food and supplies for its people from the Capitol. The event serves as entertainment to the Capitol and is a method for them to assert their dominance.

In the story, Katniss Evergreen volunteers to participate in place of her sister when she is selected to participate by lottery. The trilogy follows her as she faces many dangers in the course of the games. Further along the trilogy, the other districts rise in rebellion against the dictatorship of the Capitol and its leader, President Snow. Katniss is a major part of the rebellion. The trilogy weaves its way through a number of conspiracies, plans and twists.

The Hunger Games Trilogy (Set Of 3 Books) has been extremely well received by the worldwide audience. It has been one of the best selling series of all time with over 26 million books sold. The books have been adapted to film. The first book, The Hunger Games, was released as a film in March 2012.

Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.

Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.

In Catching Fire, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.",Catching Fire: The Hunger Games (Book 2),Suzanne Collins, , ,Scholastic,9789351035978,"Reissue,2016",391,India,English

The prom. It's supposed to be one of the best nights of your life. Or, at least, you're supposed to have a good time. But what if you'd rather be going with your best friend's date than your own? What if a sinister underground society of students has spiked the punch? What if your date turns out to be more of a frog than a prince? Or what if he's (literally) an ape? 

There are ways you can fight it. You can protest the silliness of the regular prom by hosting a backwards prom - also known as a morp. You can throw a prom for fat girls. You can stay at home to watch old teen movies and get your cute neighbor and his cuter brother to join you. You can dance to your own music.

The main characters are Trina O'Dell and her brother, Dan O'Dell. Their father, Danny O'Dell, collects various ventriloquist dummies. One day, Mr. O'Dell brings Slappy home after finding him in a dumpster. After repairing his broken shaft, he names him Smiley, unaware of the dummy's past. Trina finds a piece of paper in Slappy's front pocket and reads it. Shortly after, Slappy slaps her across the face. Naturally, nobody believes her. Trina and Dan's cousin, Zane, is coming for a visit. Their father makes them promise not to scare Zane, as they had done in a previous visit. After a while, one of the dummies called Rocky pops up in weird places, scaring Zane while Trina and Dan get the blame for each incident. Many things are ruined: Zane's camera, the dinner table, and the film in Zane's camera by the dummy.

Dan and Trina eventually catch Zane taking Rocky from the attic and it is revealed that Zane was placing Rocky in the weird places for fun. The three make a truce not to prank each other like that going forward. More catastrophes occur afterward, each with Rocky at the scene of the crime. Dan suspects Zane and tells Trina, but nobody else believes them. To prove that Zane is guilty, Dan and Trina sneak up to the attic to wait for Zane to come up and steal Rocky.

To their horror, they discover Slappy trying to sneak off with Rocky, and Slappy tells them that they are his slaves. Dan and Trina try to dump Slappy in a well, but he comes back the next morning. Trina thinks back and remembers the magic words she read to bring Slappy to life. Trina thought it could put him to sleep as well. Trina and Dan sneak up into the attic and read the magic words out loud. Slappy is still alive and well, but all of the other dummies come to life. They all huddle around Slappy, as he screams. It is then described that the dummies ""pulled and tugged him,"" but Slappy is not killed. Afterward, all the dummies fall down lifeless just as Zane walks into the attic. Zane spots Dan and Trina in the attic with the dummies lying around and rats them out to their father.

The next day, Zane leaves to go back home with his father. After being asked to give Zane a dummy, Trina gives Zane Slappy as a parting gift as payback for getting her and Dan grounded. Trina watches Zane get into the car and sees the dummy wink at her.",Goosebumps (Night of the Living Dummy iii),R.L. Stine, , ,Scholastic,9780590568777,"Reprinted,2017",126,India,English

Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.

Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.

In Catching Fire, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.",Catching Fire: The Hunger Games (Book 2),Suzanne Collins, , ,Scholastic,9789351035978,"Reissue,2016",391,India,English

The prom. It's supposed to be one of the best nights of your life. Or, at least, you're supposed to have a good time. But what if you'd rather be going with your best friend's date than your own? What if a sinister underground society of students has spiked the punch? What if your date turns out to be more of a frog than a prince? Or what if he's (literally) an ape? 

There are ways you can fight it. You can protest the silliness of the regular prom by hosting a backwards prom - also known as a morp. You can throw a prom for fat girls.

The main characters are Trina O'Dell and her brother, Dan O'Dell. Their father, Danny O'Dell, collects various ventriloquist dummies. One day, Mr. O'Dell brings Slappy home after finding him in a dumpster. After repairing his broken shaft, he names him Smiley, unaware of the dummy's past. Trina finds a piece of paper in Slappy's front pocket and reads it. Shortly after, Slappy slaps her across the face. Naturally, nobody believes her. Trina and Dan's cousin, Zane, is coming for a visit. Their father makes them promise not to scare Zane, as they had done in a previous visit. After a while, one of the dummies called Rocky pops up in weird places, scaring Zane while Trina and Dan get the blame for each incident. Many things are ruined: Zane's camera, the dinner table, and the film in Zane's camera by the dummy.

Dan and Trina eventually catch Zane taking Rocky from the attic and it is revealed that Zane was placing Rocky in the weird places for fun. The three make a truce not to prank each other like that going forward. More catastrophes occur afterward, each with Rocky at the scene of the crime. Dan suspects Zane and tells Trina, but nobody else believes them. To prove that Zane is guilty, Dan and Trina sneak up to the attic to wait for Zane to come up and steal Rocky.

To their horror, they discover Slappy trying to sneak off with Rocky, and Slappy tells them that they are his slaves. Dan and Trina try to dump Slappy in a well, but he comes back the next morning. Trina thinks back and remembers the magic words she read to bring Slappy to life. Trina thought it could put him to sleep as well. Trina and Dan sneak up into the attic and read the magic words out loud. Slappy is still alive and well, but all of the other dummies come to life. They all huddle around Slappy, as he screams. It is then described that the dummies ""pulled and tugged him,"" but Slappy is not killed. Afterward, all the dummies fall down lifeless just as Zane walks into the attic. Zane spots Dan and Trina in the attic with the dummies lying around and rats them out to their father.

The next day, Zane leaves to go back home with his father. After being asked to give Zane a dummy, Trina gives Zane Slappy as a parting gift as payback for getting her and Dan grounded. Trina watches Zane get into the car and sees the dummy wink at her.",Goosebumps (Night of the Living Dummy iii),R.L. Stine, , ,Scholastic,9780590568777,"Reprinted,2017",126,India,English

In the Capitol, the people are rich and live lavish lives. In the rest of the districts, however, the conditions are deplorable and the people extremely poor. The Capitol arranges an annual event called The Hunger Games, in which, citizens from the rest of the 12 districts fight till their death in a dangerous arena which is televised to the entire country. The citizens are selected by lottery. The district that wins, receive numerous rewards, food and supplies for its people from the Capitol. The event serves as entertainment to the Capitol and is a method for them to assert their dominance.

In the story, Katniss Evergreen volunteers to participate in place of her sister when she is selected to participate by lottery. The trilogy follows her as she faces many dangers in the course of the games. Further along the trilogy, the other districts rise in rebellion against the dictatorship of the Capitol and its leader, President Snow. Katniss is a major part of the rebellion. The trilogy weaves its way through a number of conspiracies, plans and twists.

The books have been adapted to film. The first book, The Hunger Games, was released as a film in March 2012.

Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.

Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.

In Catching Fire, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.",Catching Fire: The Hunger Games (Book 2),Suzanne Collins, , ,Scholastic,9789351035978,"Reissue,2016",391,India,English

What if a sinister underground society of students has spiked the punch? What if your date turns out to be more of a frog than a prince? Or what if he's (literally) an ape? 

There are ways you can fight it. You can protest the silliness of the regular prom by hosting a backwards prom - also known as a morp. You can throw a prom for fat girls. You can stay at home to watch old teen movies and get your cute neighbor and his cuter brother to join you. You can dance to your own music.

The main characters are Trina O'Dell and her brother, Dan O'Dell. Their father, Danny O'Dell, collects various ventriloquist dummies. One day, Mr. O'Dell brings Slappy home after finding him in a dumpster. After repairing his broken shaft, he names him Smiley, unaware of the dummy's past. Trina finds a piece of paper in Slappy's front pocket and reads it. Shortly after, Slappy slaps her across the face. Naturally, nobody believes her. Trina and Dan's cousin, Zane, is coming for a visit. Their father makes them promise not to scare Zane, as they had done in a previous visit. After a while, one of the dummies called Rocky pops up in weird places, scaring Zane while Trina and Dan get the blame for each incident. Many things are ruined: Zane's camera, the dinner table, and the film in Zane's camera by the dummy.

Dan and Trina eventually catch Zane taking Rocky from the attic and it is revealed that Zane was placing Rocky in the weird places for fun. The three make a truce not to prank each other like that going forward. More catastrophes occur afterward, each with Rocky at the scene of the crime. Dan suspects Zane and tells Trina, but nobody else believes them. To prove that Zane is guilty, Dan and Trina sneak up to the attic to wait for Zane to come up and steal Rocky.

To their horror, they discover Slappy trying to sneak off with Rocky, and Slappy tells them that they are his slaves. Dan and Trina try to dump Slappy in a well, but he comes back the next morning. Trina thinks back and remembers the magic words she read to bring Slappy to life. Trina thought it could put him to sleep as well. Trina and Dan sneak up into the attic and read the magic words out loud. Slappy is still alive and well, but all of the other dummies come to life. They all huddle around Slappy, as he screams. It is then described that the dummies ""pulled and tugged him,"" but Slappy is not killed. Afterward, all the dummies fall down lifeless just as Zane walks into the attic. Zane spots Dan and Trina in the attic with the dummies lying around and rats them out to their father.

The next day, Zane leaves to go back home with his father. After being asked to give Zane a dummy, Trina gives Zane Slappy as a parting gift as payback for getting her and Dan grounded. Trina watches Zane get into the car and sees the dummy wink at her.",Goosebumps (Night of the Living Dummy iii),R.L. Stine, , ,Scholastic,9780590568777,"Reprinted,2017",126,India,English

A CHEESE-COLORED CAMPER 
My grandfather William Shortpaws was back at The Rodent's Gazette, and he was determined to drive me up a clock! He wanted to publish a guide book to Ratzikistan, the coldest, darkest, most remote spot on all of Mouse Island. And he wanted me to write it!

The Hunger Games Trilogy (Set Of 3 Books) consists of the three books, The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay. The books are set in an uncertain future in the totalitarian regime of Panem, created after the destruction of North America. The entire country is dominated by the rich state known as the Capitol.

In the Capitol, the people are rich and live lavish lives. In the rest of the districts, however, the conditions are deplorable and the people extremely poor. The Capitol arranges an annual event called The Hunger Games, in which, citizens from the rest of the 12 districts fight till their death in a dangerous arena which is televised to the entire country. The citizens are selected by lottery. The district that wins, receive numerous rewards, food and supplies for its people from the Capitol. The event serves as entertainment to the Capitol and is a method for them to assert their dominance.

In the story, Katniss Evergreen volunteers to participate in place of her sister when she is selected to participate by lottery. The trilogy follows her as she faces many dangers in the course of the games. Further along the trilogy, the other districts rise in rebellion against the dictatorship of the Capitol and its leader, President Snow. Katniss is a major part of the rebellion. The trilogy weaves its way through a number of conspiracies, plans and twists.

The Hunger Games Trilogy (Set Of 3 Books) has been extremely well received by the worldwide audience. It has been one of the best selling series of all time with over 26 million books sold. The books have been adapted to film. The first book, The Hunger Games, was released as a film in March 2012.

Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.

Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.

In Catching Fire, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.",Catching Fire: The Hunger Games (Book 2),Suzanne Collins, , ,Scholastic,9789351035978,"Reissue,2016",391,India,English

The prom. It's supposed to be one of the best nights of your life. Or, at least, you're supposed to have a good time. But what if you'd rather be going with your best friend's date than your own? What if a sinister underground society of students has spiked the punch? What if your date turns out to be more of a frog than a prince? Or what if he's (literally) an ape? 

There are ways you can fight it. You can protest the silliness of the regular prom by hosting a backwards prom - also known as a morp. You can throw a prom for fat girls. You can stay at home to watch old teen movies and get your cute neighbor and his cuter brother to join you. You can dance to your own music.

The main characters are Trina O'Dell and her brother, Dan O'Dell. Their father, Danny O'Dell, collects various ventriloquist dummies. One day, Mr. O'Dell brings Slappy home after finding him in a dumpster. After repairing his broken shaft, he names him Smiley, unaware of the dummy's past. Trina finds a piece of paper in Slappy's front pocket and reads it. Shortly after, Slappy slaps her across the face. Naturally, nobody believes her. Trina and Dan's cousin, Zane, is coming for a visit. Their father makes them promise not to scare Zane, as they had done in a previous visit. After a while, one of the dummies called Rocky pops up in weird places, scaring Zane while Trina and Dan get the blame for each incident. Many things are ruined: Zane's camera, the dinner table, and the film in Zane's camera by the dummy.

Dan and Trina eventually catch Zane taking Rocky from the attic and it is revealed that Zane was placing Rocky in the weird places for fun. The three make a truce not to prank each other like that going forward. More catastrophes occur afterward, each with Rocky at the scene of the crime. Dan suspects Zane and tells Trina, but nobody else believes them. To prove that Zane is guilty, Dan and Trina sneak up to the attic to wait for Zane to come up and steal Rocky.

To their horror, they discover Slappy trying to sneak off with Rocky, and Slappy tells them that they are his slaves. Dan and Trina try to dump Slappy in a well, but he comes back the next morning. Trina thinks back and remembers the magic words she read to bring Slappy to life. Trina thought it could put him to sleep as well. Trina and Dan sneak up into the attic and read the magic words out loud. Slappy is still alive and well, but all of the other dummies come to life. They all huddle around Slappy, as he screams. It is then described that the dummies ""pulled and tugged him,"" but Slappy is not killed. Afterward, all the dummies fall down lifeless just as Zane walks into the attic. Zane spots Dan and Trina in the attic with the dummies lying around and rats them out to their father.

The next day, Zane leaves to go back home with his father. After being asked to give Zane a dummy, Trina gives Zane Slappy as a parting gift as payback for getting her and Dan grounded. Trina watches Zane get into the car and sees the dummy wink at her.",Goosebumps (Night of the Living Dummy iii),R.L. Stine, , ,Scholastic,9780590568777,"Reprinted,2017",126,India,English

Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.

Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.

In Catching Fire, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.",Catching Fire: The Hunger Games (Book 2),Suzanne Collins, , ,Scholastic,9789351035978,"Reissue,2016",391,India,English

The prom. It's supposed to be one of the best nights of your life. Or, at least, you're supposed to have a good time. But what if you'd rather be going with your best friend's date than your own? What if a sinister underground society of students has spiked the punch? What if your date turns out to be more of a frog than a prince? Or what if he's (literally) an ape? 

There are ways you can fight it. You can protest the silliness of the regular prom by hosting a backwards prom - also known as a morp. You can throw a prom for fat girls.

The main characters are Trina O'Dell and her brother, Dan O'Dell. Their father, Danny O'Dell, collects various ventriloquist dummies. One day, Mr. O'Dell brings Slappy home after finding him in a dumpster. After repairing his broken shaft, he names him Smiley, unaware of the dummy's past. Trina finds a piece of paper in Slappy's front pocket and reads it. Shortly after, Slappy slaps her across the face. Naturally, nobody believes her. Trina and Dan's cousin, Zane, is coming for a visit. Their father makes them promise not to scare Zane, as they had done in a previous visit. After a while, one of the dummies called Rocky pops up in weird places, scaring Zane while Trina and Dan get the blame for each incident. Many things are ruined: Zane's camera, the dinner table, and the film in Zane's camera by the dummy.

Dan and Trina eventually catch Zane taking Rocky from the attic and it is revealed that Zane was placing Rocky in the weird places for fun. The three make a truce not to prank each other like that going forward. More catastrophes occur afterward, each with Rocky at the scene of the crime. Dan suspects Zane and tells Trina, but nobody else believes them. To prove that Zane is guilty, Dan and Trina sneak up to the attic to wait for Zane to come up and steal Rocky.

To their horror, they discover Slappy trying to sneak off with Rocky, and Slappy tells them that they are his slaves. Dan and Trina try to dump Slappy in a well, but he comes back the next morning. Trina thinks back and remembers the magic words she read to bring Slappy to life. Trina thought it could put him to sleep as well. Trina and Dan sneak up into the attic and read the magic words out loud. Slappy is still alive and well, but all of the other dummies come to life. They all huddle around Slappy, as he screams. It is then described that the dummies ""pulled and tugged him,"" but Slappy is not killed. Afterward, all the dummies fall down lifeless just as Zane walks into the attic. Zane spots Dan and Trina in the attic with the dummies lying around and rats them out to their father.

The next day, Zane leaves to go back home with his father. After being asked to give Zane a dummy, Trina gives Zane Slappy as a parting gift as payback for getting her and Dan grounded. Trina watches Zane get into the car and sees the dummy wink at her.",Goosebumps (Night of the Living Dummy iii),R.L. Stine, , ,Scholastic,9780590568777,"Reprinted,2017",126,India,English
