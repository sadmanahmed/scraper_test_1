In writing this book, I think of myself as a translator whose job it is to interpret and synthesize what I’ve read and learned. My great respect goes to the researchers who, in recent decades, have uncovered these behavioral and cognitive errors. The success of this book is fundamentally a tribute to their research. I am enormously indebted to them.”

The indispensable new work from the author of the international and Sunday Times bestseller The Art of Thinking Clearly

Have you ever...

· Spent too long on a powerpoint presentation?
· Lost sight of what makes you happy?
· Failed to reach a long-term goal?
· Become infuriated by queuing, tax or parking tickets?
· Broken a promise you knew you'd keep?

Since the dawn of civilization, we've been asking ourselves what it means to live a good life: how should I live, what will truly make be happy, how much should I earn, how should I spend my time? In the absence of a single simple answer, what we need is a toolkit of mental models, a guide to practical living.

In The Art of the Good Life, you'll find fifty-two intellectual shortcuts for wiser thinking and better decisions, at home and at work. They may not guarantee you a good life, but they'll give you a better chance.",The Art of the Good Life,Rolf Dobelli, , ,Sceptre (India),9781473667488,"1st Edition,2017",260,India,English
