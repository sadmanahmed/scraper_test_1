One thing is certain: he was the greatest footballer of his generation -- and perhaps of all time. A poor boy from a Buenos Aires shanty-town, his genius with a ball took him to the heights of European and world football, and his struggle with the pressures of life inside and outside the game pulled him right back down again. Never before has Maradona given us his extraordinary story in his own words. Until now.

'El Diego illustrates the man's simple, unadulterated love for the game, for the pure unsullied act of taking a football and making it dance to his exuberant tunes. It's a love story, without a happy ending, stopping when he walks off the pitch for the last time' 
-Scotsman

He is accompanied by his son Chris. For the first nine days, they also ride alongside close friends John and Sylvia Sutherland. They part ways in Montana, and throughout their trip, they discuss philosophical topics. They discuss things like epistemology, ethical emotivism and the philosophy of science. These discussions also concern the author’s past as a teacher of creative and technical writing at a small college. The author seeks his past, and discovers that his fascination with the definition of good writing and the nature of quality drove him insane.

The demon saw Kitty the moment she moved. A wide mouth opened in the stubby, featureless head; double rows of teeth descended from above and rose from the lining of the jaw. It snipped its teeth together curiously, making a noise like a thousand scissors slicing in unison. Folds of grey-green flesh shifted on either side of the skull, revealing two golden eyes that glinted as they turned on her.

A killer’s sneakers whisper across the floor of a fancy home in suburban Georgetown. Far away in a gay movie theater in Washington, D.C., a patron is strangled to death. The breaking news across America the next day is that of the shocking assassination of two of the country’s Supreme Court Justices. Darby Shaw, a young law student in New Orleans drafts a legal brief. To her, it is just a brilliant guess, but in the corridors of power at the Washington establishment it is considered a political dynamite. Soon, she finds herself a witness to a murder that was actually intended for her.

Going into hiding, she realizes that there is just one trustworthy person who happens to be an ambitious reporter. The reporter is the only person who can help Darby fit the pieces of the deadly jigsaw puzzle. A cover-up that is very violent is being staged between Louisiana and the inner sanctums of the White House. Someone has stumbled upon Darby’s shot-in-the-dark legal brief and will stop at nothing to destroy the evidence of this heinous crime and preserve the secrets of the Pelican Brief.

Published in the year 1992, The Pelican Brief’s film adaptation was released in the following year. It starred Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington as the main protagonists.

Grisham was born on February 8, 1955 in Jonesboro, Arkansas. After completing his accounting major at Mississippi State University he graduated in law from the University of Mississippi School of Law in the year 1981. Then, he practiced law for close to 10 years in Southaven. In 1983, he was elected to the State House of Representatives and served there until 1990. It was at the DeSoto County courthouse one day that he overheard the testimony of a 12 year old rape victim that inspired him to write his debut novel, A Time To Kill, that was published in June 1988. He is the author of many popular novels that have managed to remain on the bestseller list for a very long time. Many of his novels have been adapted into feature films and have also gone on to become Hollywood blockbusters. He married Renee Jones and has two children.
