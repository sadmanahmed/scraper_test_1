IBD has also emerged as an important example of a complex chronic inflammatory disease where genetics, environmental risk factors, and individual phenotypic expression of disease interact to establish patterns of disease and potential disease etiologies. In fact, the recent description of a gene specific for Crohn?s disease (NOD2), the exploration of the role of microbes in disease causation, and the harnessing of microbes therapeutically (such as with probiotics) have facilitated the emergence of IBD as an important model amongst the chronic inflammatory diseases. This Yearbook is the first in an annual series, providing clinicians and scientists with state-of-the-art updates on the hot topics relevant to clinical practice and to IBD research.",The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Yearbook,Leopold A.
