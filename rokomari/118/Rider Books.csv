Growing old is part of life. Ageing is a physical process in which the body is affected by many factors and begins to slowly degenerate. The body loses the strength and vigour that it enjoyed when it was younger.

It happens to everyone, so it is considered inevitable, that nothing can be done to avoid it. Ageless Body, Timeless Mind: A Practical Alternative To Growing Old says that the premise is wrong. Ageing is not inevitable. The book says that there are three kinds of ages for humans.
One is the Chronological Age, measured in time that says the person is so many years old. The other is Biological Age that reflects how strong or weak the body is, how the years have affected the physical aspects of the body. The other is Psychological Age. This refers to how old the person actually feels.

The author says that most people lack inward vision and this deficiency in self-knowledge is responsible for sickness, ageing and other negative aspects of life. The arrow of time always moves forward. Thus, a person is born, grows up, ages, and dies. However, the book shows that this need not necessarily mean that physical degeneration is unavoidable. Through meditation, yoga and other practices, it is possible to control the effect time has on the body and stay young in spite of the progression of time.

Ageless Body, Timeless Mind: A Practical Alternative To Growing Old shows how in some societies, lifestyle and habits ensure a person enjoys a long and healthy life, while in others, the lifestyle is such that a person begins to physically age at an early stage.

The process of meditation involving the repetition of mantras creates a vibration that takes the mind out of its usual preoccupation with conflicting thoughts and shows its own origin in silence. This silence, the gap between thoughts, the empty space is the quantum space that is the source of all matter and energy. When the mind learns to be in this space, it is calm and undisturbed and this has a positive effect on the body, reducing the physical effects of time.

The author uses research and knowledge from various fields like quantum physics, biology, spirituality and medicine to show that physical aging is not an inevitable process but one that can be controlled and curtailed so that a person stays young and healthy whatever their chronological age is.
