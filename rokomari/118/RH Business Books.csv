For the purpose of the book, being great has been defined as financial performance of companies that far exceed the norms set by others.

Jim Collins created the concept of this book after writing another management study that talked about the methodology of infusing a company with the DNA it needs to achieve greatness. This book talks about what a company can do when it isn’t born with great DNA. For the purpose of the study, the author used a team of researchers who reportedly studied 6,000 articles, transcribed 2,000 pages from interviews and also generated 384 megabytes of data during a five-year project.

The book highlights seven different characteristics that are inherent qualities of great companies. These include the type of leadership that a company requires, the act of recruiting the right people before proceeding with operations and the use of technology as a factor to stimulate your company’s growth.

Companies that are categorized as great in Good To Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...And Others Don't include the Gillette Company, Kimberly Clark and Wells Fargo. There are also comparators that are used as examples of similar companies that were present in similar spaces who failed to transition into greatness. The comparators include Bank Of America, Great Western Bank and Silo.

Good To Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...And Others Don't is considered one of the most influential management books of its time. Many members belonging to The Wall Street Journal’s CEO council have considered the book to be the best management book they have ever read. The acclaim translated to 4 million copies sold and it transcended from the usual audience of a business book to a much wider audience.

""Read this book and take back control of your rational mind."" (New Scientist)

""His arguments are thorough and persuasive. He's an entertaining writer...Lindstrom's fascinating account of brain watching and the results it produced offer a fresh perspective on our decision-making processes, and make rewarding reading not just for marketing professionals, but for anyone interested in the way we behave"" (Velocity)

Synopsis
Even the faintest whiff of lemon sells cleaning products. Negative messages from politicians win votes. Product placement in films rarely works. Many multi-million pound advertising campaigns are a complete waste of time. These are just a few of the findings of Martin Lindstrom's groundbreaking study of what really makes consumers tick. Convinced that there is a gulf between what we believe influences us and what actually does, he set up a highly ambitious research project that employed the very latest in brain-scanning technology and called on the services of some 2000 volunteers.""Buyology"" shares the fruits of this research, revealing for the first time what actually goes on inside our heads when we see an advertisement, hear a marketing slogan, taste two rival brands of drink, or watch a programme sponsored by a major company. The conclusions are both startling and groundbreaking, showing the extent to which we deceive ourselves when we think we are making considered decisions, and revealing factors as varied as childhood memories and religious belief that come together to influence our decisions and shape our tastes.

From the Back Cover
Why did so many people who took the 'Pepsi challenge' say they preferred Pepsi only to carry on buying Coca-Cola?
Why do the majority of anti-smoking campaigns inadvertently encourage people to smoke?
Why does the scent of melons help sell electronic products?

If you're bewildered by these questions, then Buyology will make everything clear. Written by one of the world's top branding gurus, and drawing on state-of-the-art research, it shows why we don't always buy things for the reasons we think we do.
