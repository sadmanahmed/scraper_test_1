Islam and Healing : Loss and Recovery of an Indo Muslim Medical Tradition 1600 -1900 ,সীমা আলভি,"TK. 1,611","",https://rokomari.com//book/86001/islam-and-healing---loss-and-recovery-of-an-indo-muslim-medical-tradition-1600--1900,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/rokimg_20140810_86001.gif,"Indo-Muslim medicine?or the Unani tradition?developed in South Asia alongside Mughal political culture. While it healed the body, it also had a profound bearing on the social fabric of the region. Seema Alavi?s book shows the nature and extent of this Islamic healing tradition?s interaction with Indian society and politics from roughly 1600 to 1900. Drawing on Persian texts for the pre-colonial phase, Alavi then moves beyond the standard colonial archive to deploy unused Urdu texts, pamphlets, local newspapers, and private family records. The result is a substantial revision of the existing historiography of Indian Islam?s encounter with Western medicine. This book represents, in fact, the first major effort at telling the story of an Islamic healing tradition and its subsequent transformation by locating it within both pre-colonial and colonial time frames. Alavi shows precisely how, in the period of high colonialism, established practitioners kept their tradition alive. Their struggles to preserve and recast the Mughal legacy, control knowledge, and consolidate doctrinaire languages of power when confronting print culture and Western education are compellingly documented and analysed. Without disprivileging the state, she demonstrates how an in-house struggle for hegemony can be as potent as external power during processes that define medical, social, and national modernity. In the present context, where West-dominant globalization demonizes both Islam and cultural alternatives, the implications of this book are profound. A pioneering work on social and medical history, it will interest all historians, students of Islam?s interaction with the West, alternative modernities, and the ancient as well as contemporary struggle of the local against the global.",Islam and Healing : Loss and Recovery of an Indo Muslim Medical Tradition 1600 -1900,Seema  Alavi, , ,Parmanent Black,8178241951,1st Edition,400,India,English

Bankim's Hinduism: An Anthology of Writings by Bankim Chandra chattopadhay ,অমিয়া. পি. সেন,"TK. 1,988","",https://rokomari.com//book/85996/bankim-s-hinduism--an-anthology-of-writings-by-bankim-chandra-chattopadhay,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/rokimg_20140810_85996.gif,"The great novelist and thinker Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay (1838?94), associated with his famous hymn ?Vande Mataram?, is sometimes seen as mainly a creator of Hindu nationalist icons. This is unfortunate, for Bankim was an enormously learned man, a deep and subtle thinker. A relatively unknown side of his work comprises his religious and philosophical thought, in particular his carefully argued ideas on Hinduism.

This collection of Bankim?s writings?many translated into English for the first time and excerpted from the author?s Complete Works in the Bengali original?brings out some of the inner anxieties and ambivalence within the novelist-intellectual?s work on religion, ethics, and philosophy.

By reading this book one may detect in Bankim a rational-functionalist approach to religion, as also a deepening faith and piety transcending that intellectual perspective. Bankim anticipates contemporary scholarship in claiming that Hinduism is the common name given to a variety of religious thoughts and practices; and yet, paradoxically, his writings?all penned in the colonial era of Indian subjecthood?also argue for a common Hindu heritage, as well as a unified religious and cultural world for contemporary Hindus.

A substantive Introduction and detailed annotations help to situate Bankim?s life and thought in his times.

Hindu Widow Marriage : Isharchandra Vidyasagar ,ব্রিয়ান এ. হাটচার,"TK. 1,613","",https://rokomari.com//book/85997/hindu-widow-marriage---isharchandra-vidyasagar,https://ds.rokomari.store/rokomari110/ProductNew20190903/130X186/rokimg_20140810_85997.gif,"Before the passage of the Hindu Widow?s Remarriage Act of 1856, Hindu tradition required a woman to live as a virtual outcast after her husband?s death. Widows had to shave their heads, discard their jewellery, live in seclusion, and undergo acts of penance. Ishvarchandra Vidyasagar was the first Indian intellectual to successfully argue against these strictures. Renowned Sanskrit scholar and passionate social reformer, Vidyasagar was the leading proponent of widow marriage in colonial India, urging his contemporaries to reject practices that caused countless women to suffer.

Vidyasagar?s strategy involved a rereading of Hindu scripture alongside an emotional plea on behalf of the widow, resulting in the reimagining of Hindu law and custom. He made his case through a two-part publication,?Hindu Widow Marriage, a tour de force of logic, erudition, and humanitarian rhetoric. In this new translation, Brian A. Hatcher makes available in English, for the first time, the entire text of one of the most important nineteenth-century treatises on Indian social reform.

An expert on Vidyasagar, Hinduism, and colonial Bengal, Hatcher enhances the original treatise with a substantial introduction describing Vidyasagar?s multifaceted career, as well as the history of colonial debates on widow marriage. He also provides an overview of basic Hindu categories for first-time readers, a glossary of technical vocabulary, and an extensive bibliography.
