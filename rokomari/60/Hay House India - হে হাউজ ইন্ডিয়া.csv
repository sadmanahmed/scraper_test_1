Deepak Chopra writes this very relevant self-help book that is primed to explain to readers the ways to attain success. He focuses on showing them an alternate path that is more considerate to the human spirit engaging the philosophies in Hinduism and spiritualism. According to Chopra, the deepest desires can be fulfilled by following the laws of nature and the excavation of this premise is the book’s triumph.

According to Chopra, a seed naturally unfolds into a tree through nature’s bidding and doesn’t struggle in its efforts. The same corollary should therefore hold for man and he seeks out exercises and techniques that are to lend some form of spiritual connection with the inner self so as to increase productivity and reach the full potential locked within his readers.

The seven principles are all discussed in this book and they all follow in the tenets of seven laws. The seven laws begin with the Law of Pure Potentiality where he seeks out silence for his readers. Then he expounds the Law of Giving, wherein he asks the readers to exchange gifts, after which he describes the Law of Karma. Both these chapters concentrate on the people surrounding us and seek out positive remuneration.

He then explains the Law of Least Effort where acceptance is the mainstay of his argument. After discussing the Law of Intention and Desire where readers are encouraged to tailor their desires into a list, he moves on to the Law of Detachment. Here, he eloquently lays out the premise of uncertainty in the path to success and freedom. He ends his seven spiritual lessons with the Law of Dharma where he tells us to discover our talents, and make best use of those talents to serve others.

Drawing from the concepts engaged in Hinduism and other spiritual doctrines, Seven Spiritual Laws Of Success: A Pocket Guide To Fulfilling Your Dreams found a wide readership upon publication in 1994. It has sold more than 3 million copies and has been a New York Times bestseller.

The key premise of the book is that because the mind and body are connected, illnesses of the body somehow have their root causes in emotional and spiritual aspects of the mind and its beliefs and thought processes. While modern medicine concerns itself with eliminating symptoms of disease in the body, using tools such as chemotherapy and other pharmaceutical drugs and various surgical techniques, Hay's approach is to identify and work to resolve what she perceives as the mental root causes of disease. Hay believes that the causes of ""dis-ease"" include stress and unhealthy thought patterns and beliefs about oneself, and postulates that the most fundamental way to affect positive change in the body is to change the way we think, using tools such as ""mirror work"" and affirmations. At the end of book, a separate section lists numerous illnesses and various emotional thought patterns that Hay believes causes them; this was derived from Hay's earlier book, Heal Your Body, which had its origins in a pamphlet she published in 1979.

Instead Of Entering Into A Pointless Debate On Whether Or Not God Exists, It Is More Important To Bear In Mind That Belief In The Existence Of God Has Little Bearing On Making A Person A Good Or A Bad Citizen. One Can Be A Saintly Person Without Believing In God And A Detestable Villain Believing In Him. In My Personalized Religion, There Is No God! Khushwant Singh, Over The Decades, Has Built Up A Reputation For Coming Up With Something New And Controversial In Each Book, And He Does Not Disappoint His Readers This Time Too. He Begins With A Chapter On The ?Need For A New Religion ? Without God?, In Which He Questions The Relevance Of God. He Then Moves On To Describe How Religion Has Proved To Be More Harmful Than Beneficial And, In The Process, Debunks Astrologers And The Breed Of So-Called ?Godmen?.

However, He Is Not Dismissive Of Religion. Through His Lucid Writing, He Brings Out The Beauty And Significance Of Holy Books Such As The Bhagvad Gita, The Quran And The Granth Sahib. He Provides Relevant Extracts To Highlight The Poetry And The Music In Such Books. The Author Next Tries To Dispel The Prejudices Held By Many Non-Muslims Against Their Muslim Compatriots By Giving Down-To-Earth Examples. He Also Emphasizes The Importance Of The Ramzaan Fast. Khushwant Singh?S Description Of The Life And Times Of Guru Nanak And Guru Gobind Singh And His In-Depth Analysis Of The Granth Sahib Throw New Light On A Particularly Troubled Period In India?S History. The Chapter Devoted To The Interaction Of The Author (A Confirmed Agnostic) With The Dalai Lama (Probably The World?S Most Renowned Spiritual Leader) Makes For Fascinating Reading. Here?S One Book Containing A Wealth Of Knowledge And Information That You Would Want To Read Or Consult Again And Again.

Deepak Chopra writes this very relevant self-help book that is primed to explain to readers the ways to attain success. He focuses on showing them an alternate path that is more considerate to the human spirit engaging the philosophies in Hinduism and spiritualism. According to Chopra, the deepest desires can be fulfilled by following the laws of nature and the excavation of this premise is the book’s triumph.

According to Chopra, a seed naturally unfolds into a tree through nature’s bidding and doesn’t struggle in its efforts. The same corollary should therefore hold for man and he seeks out exercises and techniques that are to lend some form of spiritual connection with the inner self so as to increase productivity and reach the full potential locked within his readers.

The seven principles are all discussed in this book and they all follow in the tenets of seven laws. The seven laws begin with the Law of Pure Potentiality where he seeks out silence for his readers. Then he expounds the Law of Giving, wherein he asks the readers to exchange gifts, after which he describes the Law of Karma. Both these chapters concentrate on the people surrounding us and seek out positive remuneration.

He then explains the Law of Least Effort where acceptance is the mainstay of his argument. After discussing the Law of Intention and Desire where readers are encouraged to tailor their desires into a list, he moves on to the Law of Detachment. Here, he eloquently lays out the premise of uncertainty in the path to success and freedom. He ends his seven spiritual lessons with the Law of Dharma where he tells us to discover our talents, and make best use of those talents to serve others.

Drawing from the concepts engaged in Hinduism and other spiritual doctrines, Seven Spiritual Laws Of Success: A Pocket Guide To Fulfilling Your Dreams found a wide readership upon publication in 1994. It has sold more than 3 million copies and has been a New York Times bestseller.

The key premise of the book is that because the mind and body are connected, illnesses of the body somehow have their root causes in emotional and spiritual aspects of the mind and its beliefs and thought processes. While modern medicine concerns itself with eliminating symptoms of disease in the body, using tools such as chemotherapy and other pharmaceutical drugs and various surgical techniques, Hay's approach is to identify and work to resolve what she perceives as the mental root causes of disease. Hay believes that the causes of ""dis-ease"" include stress and unhealthy thought patterns and beliefs about oneself, and postulates that the most fundamental way to affect positive change in the body is to change the way we think, using tools such as ""mirror work"" and affirmations. At the end of book, a separate section lists numerous illnesses and various emotional thought patterns that Hay believes causes them; this was derived from Hay's earlier book, Heal Your Body, which had its origins in a pamphlet she published in 1979.

Instead Of Entering Into A Pointless Debate On Whether Or Not God Exists, It Is More Important To Bear In Mind That Belief In The Existence Of God Has Little Bearing On Making A Person A Good Or A Bad Citizen. One Can Be A Saintly Person Without Believing In God And A Detestable Villain Believing In Him. In My Personalized Religion, There Is No God! Khushwant Singh, Over The Decades, Has Built Up A Reputation For Coming Up With Something New And Controversial In Each Book, And He Does Not Disappoint His Readers This Time Too. He Begins With A Chapter On The ?Need For A New Religion ? Without God?, In Which He Questions The Relevance Of God. He Then Moves On To Describe How Religion Has Proved To Be More Harmful Than Beneficial And, In The Process, Debunks Astrologers And The Breed Of So-Called ?Godmen?.

However, He Is Not Dismissive Of Religion. Through His Lucid Writing, He Brings Out The Beauty And Significance Of Holy Books Such As The Bhagvad Gita, The Quran And The Granth Sahib. He Provides Relevant Extracts To Highlight The Poetry And The Music In Such Books. The Author Next Tries To Dispel The Prejudices Held By Many Non-Muslims Against Their Muslim Compatriots By Giving Down-To-Earth Examples. He Also Emphasizes The Importance Of The Ramzaan Fast. Khushwant Singh?S Description Of The Life And Times Of Guru Nanak And Guru Gobind Singh And His In-Depth Analysis Of The Granth Sahib Throw New Light On A Particularly Troubled Period In India?S History. The Chapter Devoted To The Interaction Of The Author (A Confirmed Agnostic) With The Dalai Lama (Probably The World?S Most Renowned Spiritual Leader) Makes For Fascinating Reading. Here?S One Book Containing A Wealth Of Knowledge And Information That You Would Want To Read Or Consult Again And Again.
