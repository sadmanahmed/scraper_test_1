When a middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral, he begins to walk down memory lane. He revisits the farm at the end of the road where he once lived, where he remembers meeting a strange girl called Lettie Hempstock and her family. He hasn’t thought about Lettie in ages, but as he sits by a pond behind the derelict farmhouse, he begins to remember her once again. However, he soon remembers other nightmarish memories which feature Lettie at the eye of the tornado. In this stirring and melancholic tale, Neil Gaiman once again proves he’s the master of the realm of fantasy.

Jack Straight From The Gut presents the success story of Jack Welch, a business legend, a self-confessed rebel, and a self-made man. Written by Welch himself, the book covers numerous aspects of his journey to the top, including his unconventional business strategies, and the people who shaped his life.

Welch started his career in 1960 as a junior chemical engineer at General Electric. In 21 years, he had risen through the ranks to assume the mantle of CEO in 1981, not without being assailed by numerous struggles and political manoeuvres over the years. At that time the company’s net worth was $12 billion.

Once Welch became the CEO, he brought about a revolution of sorts in the company’s corporate fabric. Guided by his distinctive management style, the company’s net worth ratcheted up to $280 billion in 20 years.

The book highlights several aspects of his leadership style, such as an informal, yet driven style of work, an open work culture, and individual appreciation of each of his managers. His highly personal leadership style ensured that the company thrived even during one of the most volatile phases in U.S. economic history.

Welch narrates many interesting events, including the attempt to buy Honeywell and his search for a suitable successor. The book reflects Jack Welch’s passion for his work and his sheer zest for life. It is filled with humour, candour, common sense, and many business lessons for budding managers.

Jack Straight From The Gut was published in 2007 by Hachette Books India.

Like the Moghuls before him, Shah Jahan must come to power by wresting it from his siblings, all of them rivals for the throne. However, his heart is darkened by a greater desire. Instead of glory fed by the demise of his opponents, this Moghul emperor dreams of building a monument to pay his last respects to his wife. A wife so beautiful that he will raise the most beautiful monument ever constructed and financially cripple his nation to do so. But in doing so, he becomes blind to his sons and their own Machiavellian agenda to wrest the empire from their father.

A robbery leads to an explosion, which leads to the destruction of yet another car. It would be just another day in the life of Stephanie Plum...except that she becomes the target of a gang. And the target of an even scarier, more dangerous force that comes to Trenton. With super bounty hunter Ranger acting more mysteriously than ever (and the tension with vice cop Joe Morelli getting hotter), Stephanie is racing against the clock in her most suspenseful novel yet.
